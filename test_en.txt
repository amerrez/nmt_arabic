$10,000 Gold?
Now that gold has crossed the magic $1,000 barrier, why can’t it increase ten-fold, too?
Sure, some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold. But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances.
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power, demand inevitably rises, driving up the price of scarce commodities.
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends.
As someone who was present when Davutoğlu made his presentation to the parliamentary faction of Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), I can attest to the fact that he did not use such terminology.
Our neighborhood policy needs support, not criticism.
This is a natural byproduct of consolidating our democracy.
None of them, therefore, has any reason to express discomfort with Turkey.
Yet 2008-2009, like 1989, may very well correspond to an epochal change, whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades.
Yet, history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for today’s global crisis, may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass.
The End of 1945
There was talk of revolution in countries such as France, Italy, and Greece.
For a short while, many prominent people – Albert Einstein, for one – believed that only a world government would be able to ensure global peace.
The rot began during the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.
Neoliberalism filled the vacuum, creating vast wealth for some people, but at the expense of the ideal of equality that had emerged from World War II.
BERKELEY – To solve a problem, it is not enough to know what to do.
And, most audaciously of all, the European Union introduced the euro as a common currency.
The reasons why are found in the second book: Hall of Mirrors, by&nbsp;my friend, teacher, and patron, Barry Eichengreen.
MOSCOW – Most people who know of me think of me as an information-technology expert, someone who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet start-ups.
One of the group was Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Thawte (sold to VeriSign), who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second “space tourist.”
So I had vague thoughts that I might go into space sometime in 2011 - the year that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is (very) tentatively slated to go.
Why, I’d go train to be a cosmonaut, of course! And why wait to find out I may get Alzheimer’s?  Next month, I will write about what training to go into space actually involves.
Though the TPP faces no shortage of hurdles to clear before an agreement is finalized, its potential to augment Asia’s economic power cannot be underestimated.
And Russian President Vladimir Putin would invariably regard the EU’s failure as a major opportunity to exert more influence over parts of Europe.
This is not to say that resolving the remaining issues in the TTIP negotiations will be simple.
9/11 and the New Authoritarianism
Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”
In other words, liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives, but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define.
While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and popular angst.
NEW YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes, flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, hit the Pentagon with a third, and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission.
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.
But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives, money, and making open societies less so.
A “Reset” Button for Europe’s Backyard
Sweden’s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts.
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.
In Russia, there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it.
Should the best answer to the return of Russia’s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world’s new maverick? Or is a latter-day Yalta Conference, aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe, necessary?
More importantly, rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia’s great power pretensions too seriously.
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The use of force to settle scores and impose one nation’s will upon another cannot be accepted passively.
The third and most damaging flaw, however, is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places.
The higher the growth rate, the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits.
Unless more deficit reduction, which is inevitable, comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues, and less from programs vital for economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker US – and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world.
Of course, the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability.
Now, with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention, the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again.
But neither improved competitiveness, nor reduction of total debt, can be achieved overnight.
But the problem now in Europe is the opposite: banks are “national in life, but European in death.”
When problems started to surface, the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out “the cheapest bank rescue ever.”
Putting the ECB in charge should also help to stop the creeping disintegration process, which is not publicly visible, but is very real nonetheless.
Economic (and political) logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund.
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it.
Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many from Scotland), who migrated and colonized territories, allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption.
In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:
A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called “creative destruction” is under way: even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity, credit to business and households is shrinking.
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China.
Now the world's attention is focussed on Iran, one recipient of Pakistani technology, as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal.
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons.
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel.
A Big Chance for Small Farmers
It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.
That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating.
Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated.
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out. The man refused.
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama.
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates.
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?
PARIS &#45;&#45; Ever since French President Nicolas Sarkozy took himself off his country’s most-eligible-bachelor list by publicly acknowledging his affair with supermodel-turned-pop-musician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Euro Disney, he’s run into trouble. 
It’s “serious,” the smitten president admitted.
Despite the sometimes downright pornographic on-screen writhing of Bollywood starlets, India is still a deeply conservative society. Divorce is anathema.
The cameras would roll, Indians would smile, and France would be treated to a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams.
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity.
Of course, the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it.
So how will the world – first and foremost, the main nuclear powers – react to the Fukushima disaster? Will the tide truly turn, propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons?
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.
Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today.
Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles: when one is used to light another, it does not diminish the light of the first. On the contrary, everything becomes brighter.
The Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative.
For the world, the WHO’s recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care, and, more broadly, to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization.
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau.
Financial markets can be fragile, and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income, which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy.
European policymakers today often complain that, were it not for the US financial crisis, the eurozone would be doing just fine.
Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years.
Liu’s committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is, above all, intended for the benefit of the Chinese people. But his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China’s participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups, an independent media, and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box.
The politicians, civil servants, and other participants at the Copenhagen summit have mainly been bombarding each other with numbers.
In the next few decades, a low-lying country like the Netherlands will need to invest billions of euros to intensify its age-old struggle against rising water.
Precisely for this reason, it also requires a broadly shared ethical basis.
They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy, and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism, and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions.
But as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil, and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as, and perhaps even worse than, the sadism of psychopaths like Alex.
It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics, or better arguments.
These are, of course, hypothetical questions.
Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income.
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite.
Once he knows of it, the decision is his to make, because only he can judge the importance of his journey, and balance that against the risk he is running.
According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime’s leading ideologist, the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one: it doesn’t know its enemies.
Military reform has been reversed.
They have also become disobedient.
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another? Cherkesov’s case exemplifies Putin’s nightmare.
And, of course, being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit.
The US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another 90 days.
This month, Brazil and Argentina recognized “Palestine,” and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow.
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states, but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state.
It could also have been the basis of a confederal state, whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers’ productivity and taxes.
That would be a disastrous step.
But this is possible only by resuscitating – and updating – an old institution of the international community: a confederation of states.
Serbia would save face, and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo, including the treatment of the Serbian minority.
They departed pledging to revive Europe's growth.
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes. So am I.
NATO has been flexible since its inception.
I am not talking about a two‑speed Europe.
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions, within the EU framework.
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state.
In literary terms, this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims.
In seeking answers, these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities.
For example, it took a “conspiracy theorist,” Alex Jones, to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens. The New Yorker confirmed the story much later – without crediting the original source.
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism: finding good data, confirming stories with two independent sources, using quotes responsibly, and eschewing anonymity – that is, standing by their own bylines, as conventional reporters do.
Europe’s leaders recognized that distressed countries’ debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow, and that growth could not be achieved without assistance.
Indeed, the most curious aspect of the ECB’s position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event.
And, with housing prices continuing to fall, GDP growth faltering, and unemployment remaining stubbornly high (one of six Americans who would like a full-time job still cannot get one), more stimulus, not austerity, is needed – for the sake of balancing the budget as well.
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1% of annual consumption, but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater.
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century. The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear: our twenty-first-century Atlantis.
The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.
Obama can rage and weep.
That seems to be changing now.
We have forgotten those days. Yet there are still 23,000 nuclear warheads on our planet, with the explosive power of 150,000 Hiroshima bombs.
This is principally an issue for the US and Russia, which possess 95% of the world’s nuclear weapons.
These are going to be some of the major questions for Obama over the next year and more. If he gets them right, he can forget about his short-term critics.
A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain’s youth are unemployed, reflecting the country’s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period. The current-account deficit remains at 3.5% of GDP, despite the recession-induced decline in imports, while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again.
In this, too, it has not really been successful, despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table.
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree.
But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all.
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse.
There is also a little more confidence in the government’s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year.
The data show, intriguingly, that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes.
But we can take it a step further back: people’s income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago – and so on, backwards in time, in a repeating feedback loop.
Although economic theory today is much improved, if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis, we will mostly get the same answers.
Chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions, and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future.
As a result, we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing.
The primary, and most pressing, of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU.
Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times, its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro.
Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia.
On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice.
But ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.
In fact, the world’s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms, or more than double the permissible limit.
At
In today’s Germany, an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation – not only for Europe, but also for Germany itself.
Therefore, the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German “politics of memory” than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be.
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia, with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on 9 May this year, reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility.
The world economy, however, is unlikely to look the same.
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group.
Their governments pursued not just good “fundamentals” (e.g., macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation), but also what might be called “productivist” policies: undervalued currencies, industrial policies, and financial controls.
In the past, this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits.
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances.
But it’s worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to tackle global warming.
My household uses CFLs, and I enjoy knowing that I am causing fewer CO2 emissions and spending less money.
This is clearly not true for those who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures because of the new bulbs, or for those who are seriously worried about mercury, or for those who have other reasons for preferring incandescent bulbs.
This is where a lot of policymakers get it wrong.
So why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to 11 years in prison, just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to one-party rule?
Hereditary monarchy, often backed by divine authority, has worked in the past.
Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals, because it was bookish, introduced a modern moral orthodoxy, and was based, like Confucianism, on a promise of perfect harmony.
The Communist Party represented China’s destiny as a great power.
Other Confucian societies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, now have thriving liberal democracies, and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China.
The new strategy that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been promoting to staunch the upward trend of narco-trafficking-related murders – which leaked Mexican government reports put at more than 22,000 since late 2006 – is to build “stronger, more resilient communities.”
Bolivia’s Evo Morales rose to prominence as leader of the country’s coca growers during a brutal campaign to wipe out their crops, the so-called Dignity Plan.
Interviewed by the Mexican magazine Proceso this year, the second-in-command of the giant Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada, made the point clearly: “The narco problem involves millions of people.
MUNICH – Under substantial external pressure, the eurozone’s crisis-hit countries are, at long last, bringing themselves to make painful cuts in their government budgets.
Only Ireland continued on a path of rapid deflation – as it has since the country’s real-estate bubble burst in 2006 – with a relative price decrease of 2.2%.
Unions, too, are resisting the necessary wage reductions, and public and private debtors fear the prospect of insolvency if their assets and revenues are assessed at a lower value, while their debts remain unchanged.
In other words, they should take a kind of euro sabbatical – a proposal that has now also been taken up by American economist Kenneth Rogoff.
This is significant, because, in May 2010, a group of prominent German economists, led by Joachim Starbatty, commenced litigation before the German Constitutional Court in which they argued that the EU’s assistance to Greece and Europe’s new financial rescue fund violated Article 125, the EU treaty’s so-called “no bailout” clause.
Now the court in Karlsruhe will have to determine whether the EU’s recently agreed European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is consistent with the Basic Law.
It is almost certain that Euro-skeptic groups will ask the Irish Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ESM.
It is easy to predict that Sarajevo will be the place where they will meet to look back on Europe’s savage twentieth century. But how will Sarajevo look in five years?
Indeed, it is striking that the majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their leaders are not interested in their country joining the EU.
The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allows for an element of visionary realism in European politics, as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the EU.
So far, the EU has offered to support democratization in Tunisia and Egypt by helping to organize free and fair elections, establish political parties, and reform the police, courts, and local administrations.
The problem is that such long-term investments bring results only in the medium and long term.
At the end of that period, participants would receive soft business-startup loans from European development banks to create employment in their countries of origin.
If they become consolidated democracies, as hoped, would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption. And start-up loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one’s fortune back home.
On both of these fronts, the EU’s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that Europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The program’s mission – to help guide the political, social, and economic transitions of neighboring states – is not inherently problematic; the problem lies in the way that the mission has been interpreted and pursued.
To the extent that there has been an EU-wide energy strategy, it has related to renewables, rather than the intersection of geopolitics and energy security.
If it can, it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge, but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today’s rapidly shifting global environment.
This requires a framework that takes into account, among other things, developmental possibilities, environmental concerns, labor conditions, and community interests, and that is adaptable to changing circumstances.
In these circumstances, there is an urgent need for a facility that allows governments of poor countries to negotiate on a par with foreign investors to reach contracts that are as fair as possible under the given circumstances.
But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership.
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal.
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges.
Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate, and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war.
Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
A Field Guide to Israeli Hawks
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.
There have been just two ugly matches so far, full of fouls, nasty attacks, and unnecessary aggression, as well as numerous yellow and red cards: Italy vs. the US, and Portugal vs. the Netherlands.
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace.
First, Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer.
For now, we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new, young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted, enthralling, and beautiful to watch.
Over the past five years, those numbers have changed, first slowly and now dramatically: in April of this year, coal’s share in power generation plummeted to just 32%, on par with gas.
Biofuels reduce emissions by only ten Mt, and solar panels by a paltry three Mt.
Meanwhile, the fracking bonanza in the US not only delivers a much greater reduction for free, but also creates long-term social benefits through lower energy costs.
For Sarkozy, “rupture” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices.
In the case of Royal, the meaning of “rupture” is both more obvious and more visible.
In terms of values, Royal, too, seems to represent a rupture with May 1968, with her emphasis on discipline and family.
When the voters decide in the spring of 2007, their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations, as it did in 2002, when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round.
His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China, leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005.
Behind the smiles, the polite interactions, and the cautiously worded diplomatic language, strong undercurrents of suspicion remain.
Finally, historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems.
In the 1990’s, foreign investors were chiefly attracted by privatization programs in the region, but more recently mergers and acquisitions and greenfield projects have been the most common type of investment.
This European experience is now being widely studied in Latin America.
But even if tariffs and quotas are progressively reduced, trade flows may remain low if other trade costs remain high.
But there is also keen awareness that the EU’s hope for a special relationship with Brazil must not be allowed to hinder regional integration or worsen asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc.
Or, to put it another way, let’s look at our problems in the light of the EU’s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies, and then let’s ask ourselves why the EU isn’t realizing its own potential and delivering the goods.
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities.
That way, if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty, it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor, the Constitutional Treaty, was in 2005.
Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad.
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism.
Hamas and other armed groups, I know, have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages.
A German Europe?
Moreover, Germany, it seems, is becoming a “geo-economic power” driven by the needs of its export sector.
On other issues, such as engaging “strategic partners” – China and Russia in particular – the United Kingdom is often a follower as well.
So, Poland and Sweden:&nbsp; Europe needs your leadership.
The same is true for Eastern Europe, the ex-Soviet states, and Latin America.
The driving force is external demand, as Germany, the world’s second-largest exporter, profits from the global boom.
In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster.
In Germany, it’s called “activating social aid” or “combi wages,” but the principle is the same: the state should reduce the money it pays for doing nothing and pay more for participating in the work force.
These trends link the fate and future of today’s seven billion people as never before. No nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century. International cooperation is a universal need.
We know how to do this. Our record proves it – in Guinea, Kenya, and Kyrgyzstan.
The government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people. It has not done so.
Reform is in the air – in part because of the scandal, but also because of the UN’s inability to deal effectively with challenges ranging from Rwanda and Kosovo to Iraq and, most recently, Sudan.
In the meantime, there is important work to be done.
Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and can count on American, Russian, European, and UN assistance.
Terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been.
Such investments could generate an estimated five million “green-collar” jobs, provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries, and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security.
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery.
A Global Growth Bargain
But neither Europe nor the US is in a strong enough position to take best advantage of these new markets.
Since then, Europe and America have grown well below their capacity (despite huge unmet demand throughout the world) and unemployment has climbed to around 10% on both continents (with youth unemployment reaching an alarming 20%).
My extrapolation of the IMF model shows that Western countries can boost their long-term GDP growth significantly by increasing their levels of capital investment over a three-year period.
NEW YORK – Dark, lowering financial and economic clouds are, it seems, rolling in from every direction: the eurozone, the United States, China, and elsewhere.
Moreover, political gridlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to persist, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins November’s presidential election.
Borrowing costs are rising for highly indebted sovereigns, credit rationing is undermining small and medium-size companies, and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries’ income.
Indeed, sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks’ balance sheet, especially in the eurozone.
Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement, as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
In the past two decades, governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats.
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increased climate volatility.
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already initiated several global processes to help establish the new post-2015 goals in an open, participatory, and knowledge-based way.&nbsp;
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy’s lame economic performance.
Though second-quarter GDP growth was weak — the euro-zone average was only 0.3% year on year – third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year.
Unfortunately, Merkel’s campaign is off to a rocky start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine’s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.
LONDON – It’s been a better year for God.
The birth of a baby in the stables.
Those of us who think that science and religion dwell in different domains, and who recall that Socrates argued that science did not teach you about morality or meaning, find that our case is undermined by the literalists and fundamentalists in every religion.
The strident and damaging dogmatism of fundamentalists of every stripe has a common feature: a truculent sense of grievance, rooted in fear and resentment of modernity.
The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike, but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
In an Arab Middle East, Iran is the natural enemy; in an Islamic world, Iran is a potential leader.
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War, but was left out of the Madrid peace conference.
BUENOS AIRES – Desperate times bring desperate measures.
To speed things up, after the default was declared in December 2008, Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders, to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned.
So the question arises: how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort?
By contrast, if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels, purchases will be more substantive, but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders.
Still, it is easier to find exciting anecdotes than it is to show how they scale up to revitalizing an entire economy.
For example, the European Union’s goal of achieving an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 implies a complete overhaul of EU infrastructure in just a few decades.
But, while the value of these studies is in the light that they shed on the parts, the ensuing headlines invariably are about the whole, articulated in terms of GDP and jobs.
Policymakers should incorporate this thinking into the “beyond austerity” narrative that is taking shape in a growing number of key EU member states.
The reason for these results is straightforward: increasing Europe’s climate-policy efforts boosts investments, thus inducing learning-by-doing, especially when these efforts are channeled into new technologies like renewable energy and advanced construction materials.
The benefit to the entire economy was bigger than the sum of the benefits for the individual mills.
And, as scientists become gloomier and underline the urgency of tackling climate change, economists are becoming increasingly optimistic about the opportunities implied by a low-carbon future.
But the country’s leaders have been stalling on the terms of a much-needed International Monetary Fund loan.
But such a move is far too risky for an individual politician, or even a single country, at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment.
And, while Tunisia’s situation seems to be the most promising, a crippling investment shortfall is threatening to derail reform efforts there.
But unconditional aid only delays reforms, because it weakens budget constraints, which reduces pressure on policymakers and creates moral hazard.
More people are not supporting Koizumi’s annual pilgrimage to Yasukuni, with seven former prime ministers jointly demanding that he refrain from the visits.
The decision triggered a severe response from China, where students held demonstrations against his visit. Bilateral relations were frozen.
As Foreign Minister Aso recently put it: “The more China voices [opposition], the more one feels like going there. It’s just like when you’re told ‘Don't smoke cigarettes,’ it actually makes you want to smoke.”
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area, causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children. Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week, this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B’Tselem, the leading Israeli human rights organization: 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3.
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, which is approximately one-fourth (28.5%) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community.
Soon, however, he was recoiling from what he saw as a chaos of competing ideas.
As the deal was intended to avoid a nuclear standoff with Iran, why was there so much outrage in the US and the West? I fear it is because the US found itself denied its primacy in setting global policy on Iran.
For it was on a Turkish flagged ship that Israeli forces killed nine people, causing a near-rupture in Israeli-Turkish relations.
And regional players like South Africa, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, and South Korea among others, will also have to be reckoned with in future regional disputes.
A Japanese Metamorphosis?
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP.
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP lawmakers checked the bills, and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet (parliament). Since the LDP, recently with a coalition partner, controlled the Diet, the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins, centered in the LDP’s headquarters.
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.
The big losers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism.
Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate was 6.2% – more than triple the rate in 1990.
A long, painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce.
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector.
What was the meaning of this moment of grace? Was it purely the product of a collective delusion, an emotional Potemkin village of sorts, encouraged, if not conceived, by the authorities to restore some level of self-assurance among France’s depressed citizens?
The second lesson, even more obvious, is that reality cannot be changed with a simple public spectacle.
Seeing the behavior of friends, all French, listening with me to Hollande, I was reminded of another moment.
After a year of Hollande, France is witnessing a fundamental political revolution.
But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns.
Now, in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis, Turkey’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus.
Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world, and certainly not in this interconnected region.
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show.
Opportunism has had its share in this, of course.
Moreover, Czechoslovakia’s fearsome secret police, who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him.
But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work’s merit, yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses? An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists, while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police.
First, the global significance of US President Barack Obama’s reelection is clear: the world has escaped a disaster for international cooperation.
The VAT increase will hurt, but there was no other way.
The principle that international cooperation is required to protect fishery resources, which are dwindling everywhere, was adopted at the 2011 CCAMLR meeting.
A League of Democracies?
Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board.
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries (India is a partial exception), mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots, since World War II.
By implicitly bypassing the UN, and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war.
Noble rhetoric!
The starting point of the contagion was investors’ realization that Europe’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, was designed to provide emergency financial support only to the peripheral countries.
A eurozone government, by contrast, is always in a precarious situation: it has only very long-term assets (its taxing power) and shorter-term liabilities, namely government debt, much of which has to be rolled over annually.
For countries with solvency problems, an adjustment program like those for Greece, Ireland, or Portugal would be appropriate.
It is a choice that they cannot put off much longer.
For example, the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt via inflation is unavailable to the PIIGS, because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket.
The real depreciation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher, making them even more unsustainable.
Policymakers should also consider innovations used to help debt-burdened developing countries in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
He assured Chinese leaders that the United States is committed to honoring all its debts, despite its recent credit downgrade; he talked enthusiastically about US-China interdependence; and he showcased his granddaughter, who has studied Chinese for several years, as a future bridge between the two countries.
And the world’s only military superpower is often seen within China as trigger-happy when intervening in other countries’ internal affairs.
Despite decades of close interaction, with millions of Americans, Europeans, and Japanese visiting China every year and similar numbers of Chinese now visiting the US and other advanced countries, both sides see each other through a glass darkly.
China’s rise is a fact; the enduring peacefulness of that rise must be a priority for China, its neighbors, the West, and, most importantly, the US.
More recently, Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives.
I’ve been proud to follow his lead.”
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman’s critique of our system is the need for tough laws.
Even patients who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after initially seeking treatment for the correct diagnosis to be made.
Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their immediate family members than patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID.
Direct-to-consumer advertisements that refer individuals to screening questionnaires can result in patients suggesting to their doctors that they have bipolar disorder.
With the greater number of medications approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder, along with multiple reports cautioning clinicians against under-diagnosis, it appears that over-diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-diagnosis.
Current events, not just in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain, mirror the political complexity of these countries.
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace.
Europe’s strong support for the region’s economic development must remain the top priority, as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms.
A Middle Eastern Union?
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work.
Together, they would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework in which the region’s water and energy needs can be met; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal.
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence.
The G-20 could suggest that the IMF issue a significant volume of SDRs over the next three years. We would suggest, for example, an issue of SDR150-250 billion annually (approximately $240-390 billion at current exchange rates).
During a declared crisis, IMF lending should be financed entirely by new SDR issues in unlimited amounts.
Hardening Brazil’s Soft Power
Brazil’s unique approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power, reflected in the broad international support that placed Brazilians atop international institutions like the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Trade Organization.
Thus, it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry.
More broadly, we are exploring ways to cooperate in the joint development of defense technologies.
This model is not only inefficient; channeling government resources to support investment also undermines China’s social development.
With the country fully integrated into global supply chains, TFP growth hit 4%, where it remained until 2007.
Rather than directly driving investment, the state must emphasize its regulatory and enforcement functions, including setting and overseeing standards, building an effective property-rights infrastructure, and managing macroeconomic conditions.
LONDON – There was a time when league tables were to be found only on the sports pages of newspapers. Now they are a global obsession.
A ranking prepared for the City Corporation in London shows New York and London still neck and neck at the top of the league.
But the more important question for the traditional financial centers is whether international activity that can move really is moving.
Airy talk about science and manufacturing as ladders out of recession (a favorite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown) is just that – empty words.
As is always the case in peace negotiations, both sides must be willing to compromise.
Germany’s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin’s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
I am not accusing Putin’s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.
These “neo-spies” include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
A Nation Kidnapped
The July 5 protest reminded us of the 3,000 kidnappings since the start of this four-decade conflict, but Colombians could form human chains and release white balloons for many other reasons.
The smart and friendly teenagers were eager to learn how to surf the Internet, just installed in their school.
Belonging to a particular cultural group is merely a pretext for battles between the winners and losers of globalization.
The more worrisome source of anti-Semitism is different and justifies speaking of a new anti-Semitism.
Jews outside Israel feel that they have to defend – right or wrong – the country that, after all, is their ultimate hope of security.
There are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place, allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base.
For example, for the first time, North Korea’s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error – the failure of the currency redenomination.
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed.
We need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously.
The first is the rise of a Sino-centric Asia.
In any event, China’s power may be vast and rapidly growing, but it lacks the ability to compel.
It demands the power of ideas that can galvanize others.
But, while America’s continued central role in Asia is safe, the long-term viability of its security arrangements boils down to the credibility of its security assurances to allies and partners.
In particular, they object to the plan’s proposal to give increased powers and responsibilities to the Secretary General, whose selection is effectively in the hands of the Security Council’s five permanent members, which wield veto power.
In practice, however, the five permanent members now agree on a candidate, and their decision is rubber-stamped first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly.
A New Dawn for Chinese Journalism?
After 1949, the Communist Party cultivated a stable of “theoretical experts” and other ideological servants to write lengthy articles propagating “Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.”
Market pressure has also been important in pushing Chinese media to embrace change.
For example, reporting by the
I experienced firsthand the need for a new approach in 2004 in Sri Lanka.
Progress on meeting national priorities such as peace consolidation, expanding access to justice, or increasing security is monitored locally.
Supporting inclusive political dialogue and ensuring that conflict is resolved through peaceful means are the highest priorities, as are security, access to justice, and a dynamic private sector that generates sufficient job opportunities.
As the Millennium Development Goals’ 2015 end date approaches, promotion of peace, security, and non-violent conflict resolution continues to be vitally important, and must be fully integrated into any future development agenda.
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields.
It is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960’s.
Still, the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid.
Importantly, the World Bank, under its new president, Robert Zoellick, has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach.
But, in order for that to happen, a new agenda for Russia must be developed this year.
We need a democratic, competitive environment, initiative at all levels, an active civil society, and real public control.
Medvedev's decision to suspend construction of a highway through the Khimki forest near Moscow in the face of widespread civic protest was important.
It is vital that Russians believe that Medvedev’s words reflect his priorities, and that he is prepared to fight for them.
Here, I see a direct connection with the problem of education.
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities. Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.
Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities.
It was an attempt to preserve the peace (and the security of the relatively weak Austrian Empire) through a coalition of victors upholding shared values.
Abdullah sought the meeting because he believes that the world since 2001 has divided the fraternity of conservatives. Until then, he and Bush shared a common worldview, emphasizing the importance of religion, the traditional family (as both countries understood it), social discipline, and the state’s role in supporting these institutions.
The Wahhabi religious establishment, the Saudi state’s hidden co-rulers, could very well obstruct Abdullah’s attempts at regional religious reconciliation.
But that is how it is in the Middle East: you never know what lies around the corner.
If Rowhani wants to succeed in office, he will have to keep his promise to improve Iranians’ living conditions without endangering the Islamic Republic in the process.
After all, the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran would most likely exacerbate violent conflict and a nuclear arms race in the region.
Iran has tried two political approaches in the last ten years: a reformist model, under President Mohamed Khatami, and hardline radicalism, under Ahmadinejad.
During the Afghanistan conference in Bonn in 2001, Iran behaved in a pragmatic, results-oriented way – an approach that went completely unrewarded by the US.
This respite offers an ideal opportunity to push forward with reforms.
The government’s GDP share, at 56%, is the highest in the eurozone and second highest among all developed countries.
But, so far, virtually nothing has been done in this respect.
Spain and France would need a ten-year slump, with annual inflation 2% lower than that of their competitors, to regain their competitiveness.
A New Path to a Low-Carbon Economy
The tax on coal-based electricity would have to be $0.10/kilowatt-hour.
Here is another way.

Let us presume, finally, that by 2050, all electricity production has made the transition to low-carbon energy sources.
Unfortunately, cap-and-trade systems are difficult to manage and don’t give clear signals about the future price of permits.
But how can this “love-in” be made concrete?
So, the Chinese ended up embracing Chu and Locke in contradictory ways: as high-ranking representatives of the US government and as compatriots with whom they share the common bond of Chinese-ness.
Then, because the US refuses to take responsibility for its cumulative and per capita greenhouse-gas emissions – which are, respectively, roughly four and three times greater than China’s – the Chinese leadership refuses to make concessions.
He has committed himself to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and acknowledges the link between nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states.
Fourth, export controls have failed to prevent the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, not least due to the sophisticated efforts of clandestine networks like the one run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan. Nine countries already have nuclear weapons, and it would be naive to presume that others, particularly in regions of conflict, will not try to get hold of them.
Some such mechanism will be essential in the coming decades as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy.
This is a bold idea, but bold ideas are needed now more than ever.
But suppose that the reason that no Palestinians and Israelis willing to conclude such a deal have emerged is that the solution itself is domestically unsupportable on both sides.
As Nieli describes it, Palestinians “would have the right to settle anywhere within Israel just as Jews would have the right to settle anywhere within the territory of the Palestinian state.
And, in a world in which many citizens spend an increasing proportion of their time in virtual space, de facto condominialism is already happening.
While Latin America will not be a priority for either an Obama or McCain administration, continuing the United States’ neglect of the last seven years is no longer viable.
Cuba needs to return to the regional concert of powers, but it must accept this concert’s rules.
The former feels no urge to “export” its “model,” whereas the latter has a strategy and the means to do so.
NEW YORK – Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, the world is facing another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization: international capitalism and state capitalism.
The US ought not to shy away from wider use of IMF Special Drawing Rights.
The rising powers must be present at the creation of this new system in order to ensure that they will be active supporters.
He believes in international cooperation, rather than the might-is-right philosophy of the Bush-Cheney era. The emergence of the G-20 as the primary forum of international cooperation and the peer-review process agreed in Pittsburgh
Conflicts are much more likely to arise or persist when those with the means to prevent or end them cannot or will not do so. Unfortunately, this will be borne out in 2013.
Second, constant changes in technology ensure that no government can know how much damage its cyber-weapons can do or how well its deterrence will work until they use them.
There is a growing risk that the new Chinese leadership will interpret a heavier US presence in the region as an attempt to contain China’s rise and stunt its growth. We have already seen a series of worrisome confrontations in the region, pitting China against Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China Sea, and against Japan in the East China Sea.
Since then, the world has seen countless acts of violence, terrorism, famine, and environmental degradation.
The problem is that we fail to cooperate globally to put those solutions into practice.
The US, for example, currently spends around $450 billion each year on its military, but less than $15 billion to help the world's poorest countries fight disease, educate their children, and protect the environment.
Then, in July, the UK will host the annual G-8 Summit of the rich countries.
Let us make our leaders aware that we aspire to shared peace and prosperity.
The world watched as thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered.
The most important imprimatur should come from the United Nations, where debate should begin immediately over a resolution authorizing a no-fly zone.
Qaddafi cannot be allowed to think that he can massacre his people with impunity.
And, as President Barack Obama has said, the Libyan people must not be deprived of full ownership of their struggle for freedom, and Qaddafi must not be given a useful foil and scapegoat.
But the West need not risk making the same mistake and accepting the same false choices.
But, given the brutality of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, no one can doubt the lengths to which it would go to hide its guilt.
What little moral and political standing Russian President Vladimir Putin has retained in the rest of the world is also evaporating, as he will soon discover at the upcoming G-20 Summit in Saint Petersburg.
LONDON – To the surprise of many in the media – at home and abroad – Pope Benedict XVI’s just completed visit to Britain was an outstanding success.
From the first day, the media understood that they had badly misread the public mood.
It dignifies an argument – and those to whom it is addressed – to set it out thoughtfully.
He was executed in the Tower of London, martyred because of his conscience.
Another example of the relationship between ethics and policy is the response that rich countries have made to global social inequity, a deep moral affront to everyone with even a modicum of conscience and sensibility.
Calderón is trying to check the gangs’ capacity for violence and diminish their economic resources, but he still has not been able to implement a plan that is both successful and minimizes the cost in lives.

A Peace Agenda for Global Development
It should aim to make justice and prosperity a reality for everyone.
The Panel should view Liberia’s ongoing efforts to secure peace, maintain stability, and initiate economic and social transformation as a blueprint for successful post-conflict transition.
A Peace of Water
Even during the 60 years of conflict in the Jordan Valley, water has more often been a source of cooperation than of conflict.
Clearly, no final agreement on water will be possible until there are agreed-upon borders between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, and some resolution of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Only a few percentage points of the Israeli GNP come from agriculture today; as a result, its economy requires less water than it once did.
One important point should be added: extensive public participation and transparency, in terms of both process and outcomes, will be key to successful management.
NEW YORK – Where is the American and global economy headed? Last year, there were two sides to the debate.
Most emerging economies may be returning to growth, but they are performing well below their potential.
Thus, there is a global slackening of aggregate demand relative to the glut of supply capacity, which will impede a robust global economic recovery.
If so, a correction cannot be too far behind.
There may now be a market for a Greek translation of her book.
They would all be bacon and sausages before any agreement was reached.
They apparently assumed that the rest of Europe would overlook continuing high deficits, and that, as eurozone members, the market would consider their debt to be just like German bunds, though issued by friendly and welcoming people in an agreeable climate, and with a glass of ouzo on the side.
Midway through her remarks, she began speaking not to the Syrian ambassador, who was in the room, or even the Syrian government, but directly to the Syrian people.
In January, the State Department unveiled a new “super-office” of Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, under the leadership of Under-Secretary Maria Otero.
Clinton has created a raft of new positions at the State Department to spur outreach to different social segments.
One privately-funded initiative spearheaded by the State Department will send 300 dogwood trees to Japan this spring, to be planted in the tsunami-affected region and in Tokyo to express the American people’s support for the Japanese people; another will send English teachers throughout Southeast Asia.

The charges against him have a powerful stigmatizing effect.

But when New Jersey Governor John Corzine was involved in a serious road accident last month, it became known that he violated his own state’s law by not wearing his seat belt.
Having been burned by the crisis, banks have tightened their lending standards, and will now be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.

This comes at a bad time, just after world governments committed themselves to achieving the development goals, such as reducing poverty and infant mortality, agreed last September at the United Nations’ Millennium Summit.
This period came to be known as the “lost decade.”
Adjustment of public expenditures raises the risk of a recovery that discriminates against the poor, and thus fuels greater inequities in developing countries.
In the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, however, the situation is completely different: in the last ten years, under the protection of the Allies' no-fly zone, and even more so since the toppling of Saddam, the Kurdish regional government has been able to establish and sustain a relatively orderly administration.
But if one thinks in terms of universal norms of human rights, what right has Turkey to dictate internal development in another country? After all, nobody accepts Israel's claim to oppose as a matter of principle the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
Perhaps they may decide that violence is counter-productive and carries its own penalties, and may then follow the Kurdish example of curbing violence, which would help put Iraq together again without recourse to permanent repression.
The Republicans should not have been caught off-guard by Americans’ interest in issues like disenfranchisement and gender equality.
Moreover, America’s science and technology policy must reflect an understanding that long-term increases in living standards depend upon productivity growth, which reflects technological progress that assumes a solid foundation of basic research.
NEW YORK – In recent years, emerging-market countries, including those in Asia, have made impressive strides in strengthening their fundamentals, accelerating their economic growth and cushioning themselves against external shocks.
First, openness to international trade and investment has been and will continue to be the linchpin of economic growth for the global economy.
Lending large sums before assessing root causes and determining appropriate policy responses can undermine the IFIs’ credibility and reduce the capital available to assist other countries in need.
Finally, both Asia and the US must remain focused on addressing the fundamental macroeconomic policy challenges that contributed to the crisis. Some of these challenges, such as the buildup of global imbalances, have been discussed for many years.
Restructuring the role of Turkey’s army is vital, but if Turkey cannot follow through with the Armenian and Kurdish openings, the country’s own domestic situation, its relations with the two peoples, as well as tensions in the Caucasus, will undoubtedly worsen.
This snarled three-way dispute, if not carefully untangled, holds many dangers.
At the same time, there is less hope in negotiations, which appear to be stalled, largely because they have been linked to the Armenia-Turkey process, which also seems to be in limbo.
Just as a loss of confidence among Kurds and Turks in eastern Turkey will rock the shaky stability that they have recently enjoyed, a loss of hope for a settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute may end the tentative military calm between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
A Return to Reason
So we need to focus more on adapting to the effects of global warming – for example, by stepping up efforts to cope with inland flooding and the urban “heat island” effect.
In the US, we witnessed an equally promising development in the climate debate just last month, when the conservative American Enterprise Institute, the liberal Brookings Institution, and the centrist Breakthrough Institute teamed up to publish a report that called for revamping America’s energy system with the aim of making clean energy cheap.
We have known for at least a generation that the world needs a course correction.

Even against tiny Bhutan, China has stepped up its lands claims through military incursions.
All these cases of preemption occurred when China was weak, poor, and internally torn.
China also has started questioning Indian sovereignty over the state of Jammu and Kashmir, one-fifth of which it occupied following the Tibet annexation.
Today, whether it is Arunachal Pradesh or Taiwan or the Senkaku Islands or even the Spratlys, China is dangling the threat of force to assert its claims.
Indeed, the Security Strategy is almost a “National” Strategy.

A successful strategy should use civilian means – incidentally a model advocated by the European Union.
A Squandered Golden Opportunity
In theory, we could simply supplement children’s diets with vitamin A in capsules, or add it to some staple foodstuff, the way that we add iodine to table salt to prevent hypothyroidism and goiter.
As the British journal Nature argued in 1992, a broad scientific consensus holds that “the same physical and biological laws govern the response of organisms modified by modern molecular and cellular methods and those produced by classical methods....
A Standby Program for the Eurozone
But we are where we are. A glimmer of hope is Europe’s willingness to use the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) imaginatively – as equity or first-loss cover.
If markets start panicking about large eurozone defaults, they could question whether even a willing Germany has the necessary capacity to support the EFSF-ECB combine.
But it is also not the mindless preacher of fiscal austerity that it is accused of being – and it should start taking the lead in managing the crisis, rather than holding up the rear.

Instead, they often seek immunity by running for public office.
This suggests not only that justice in the Philippines has a chance; equally important, it suggests that Filipinos will give justice a chance.
This is hardly the first time I have stressed the need for wholesale debt write-downs.
A gentler way to achieve some modest reduction in public and private debt burdens would be to commit to a period of sustained but moderate inflation, as I recommended in December 2008 in a commentary entitled “Inflation is Now the Lesser Evil.”
At the same time, France and Germany must both come to terms with an approach that leads to far greater political union within a couple of decades.
But the sooner the underlying reality is made transparent and becomes widely recognized, the lower the long-run cost will be.
But no one will bail out these super-sovereigns if the sovereigns prove to be insolvent.
This is needed to prevent even more private debt being put on government balance sheets, causing a fiscal blowout.
Without growth, it will be difficult to stabilize public and private debts and deficits as a share of GDP – the most important indicator of fiscal sustainability. Moreover, without growth, the social and political backlash against painful belt-tightening will eventually undermine austerity and reform.
Home prices exploded after 2000 in North America, Europe, and Asia, and in many isolated places elsewhere in the world.
We used to think that homes were in the same category as automobiles: depreciating assets that grow obsolete over time, are costly to maintain, and go out of style, eventually to be scrapped and replaced.
Thus, the bubble component in home prices is attributed to a surge in land prices, even though land prices outside of bubbly urban areas are vastly lower.
This should put a break on long-run escalation of home prices.
What kinds of power plants will be acceptable in the future? Will they be allowed to emit carbon dioxide as in the past?
The adjustments needed amount to a sizeable deficit-to-balance swing of around $700 billion in the US current account, or nearly 5% of US GNP.
Obama will need to put forward a medium-term fiscal plan that restores government finances.
This time we will need global cooperation.
The story of the US is, indeed, one of two economies.  There is a smaller one that is slowly recovering and a larger one that is still in a deep and persistent downturn.
And the credit crunch for non-investment-grade firms and smaller firms, which rely mostly on access to bank loans rather than capital markets, is still severe.
To be sure, the US government is increasing its budget deficits to put a floor under demand.
The challenges facing both are monumental.
(Or, for that matter, from northern to southern China or in multilingual India, where Hindi is spoken by only 42% of the population.)
Finally, while fiscal systems differ among American states, the overall fiscal burden is under half that of the federal level.
The eurozone countries must first deal with the sovereign-debt crisis, reduce their fiscal deficits, and strengthen the woefully undercapitalized banking system.
But they are heading in opposite directions, because, whereas Pakistan understands why Asia is rising, Myanmar does not.
Pakistan has welcomed foreign trade and investment.
Myanmar, by contrast, broadcasts no information on the dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, and would never allow the reinstatement of a Chief Justice fired by its generals, as Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf did in March, let alone demonstrations in the streets in the Chief Justice’s favor.
But to what avail? Myanmar has effectively isolated itself for more than 50 years.
If a similar impulse could be implanted into Myanmar, both its people and the world would benefit.
Since 1979, these MEPs have been elected direct rather than indirectly from national parliaments.
Third, in Britain at least, the entire political class has been discredited by a sleazy scandal about the expenses that many parliamentarians have paid themselves. Analogies with pigs, snouts, and troughs fill the pages of British newspapers.
They all vote at the same time, for the same institution. But what does an Italian know – or care, for that matter – about British politics?
A Tale of Two Terminals
After all, if China’s political system can still be called socialism, it is at best “socialism with Chinese characteristics,” which embodies an increasing amount of market-oriented economic activity and greater economic openness and transparency.
Following the disturbances in Tibet and the troubles affecting the Olympic torch’s progress around the world, some voices abroad are showing a greater inclination to dismiss, vilify, humiliate, or even split China.
Don’t get me wrong, I am not arguing for fiscal profligacy. But the balance of risks has shifted over the past few years.
Even the United States has infrastructure that is hobbled by neglect, with collapsing bridges and a dangerously overburdened electrical grid. Land-rich Brazil, too, is a case study in the consequences of under-investment.
Private oversight can often produce better and more efficient construction, and, in theory, toll roads help alleviate traffic congestion.
NEW YORK – The upcoming G-20 meeting is a make-or-break event.
The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) are now faced with a novel task: to protect the periphery countries from a storm that emanated from the center.
As things stand now, the G-20 meeting will produce some concrete results: the resources of the International Monetary Fund are likely to be effectively doubled, mainly by using the mechanism of the New Arrangement to Borrow (NAB), which can be activated without resolving the vexing question of reapportioning voting rights in the IFIs.
In addition to the one-time increase in the IMF’s resources, there ought to be substantial annual SDR issues, say, $250 billion, as long as the global recession lasts. To make the scheme counter-cyclical, the SDR issues could be callable in tranches when the global economy overheats.
Here is a list of things to watch for.
Will Europe get its act together? This could have been Europe’s moment.
This explains the almost continuous stream of measures that emanate from Beijing these days: increased public spending, monetary easing, pressure on state enterprises to expand activity, subsidies to exporters, partial convertibility of the remninbi to spur trade with neighboring countries, and so on.
The Great Depression was aggravated by the trade barriers that countries imposed to protect domestic employment.
BERKELEY – The central insight of macroeconomics is a fact that was known to John Stuart Mill in the first third of the nineteenth century: there can be a large gap between supply and demand for pretty much all currently produced goods and services and types of labor if there is an equally large excess demand for financial assets.
The government must ensure that the money supply matches the full-employment level of money demand, and that the supply of safe savings vehicles in which investors can park their wealth also meets demand.
And the rapid reductions in budget deficits that European governments are now pledged to undertake can only increase the likelihood of a full double-dip recession.
Perhaps it has taken the global economic crisis to compel Americans and Europeans to revitalize their cooperation.
The size of the IMF’s executive board should be reduced from 24 to 20 members by consolidating European representation.
With the Europeans, simultaneous pursuit of an “enhanced transatlantic market” would make a new US-EU Doha initiative on agriculture more attractive to both sides, as it would aim at reducing additional barriers to transatlantic trade that are not covered in the multilateral round.
But the host of the celebration, Russia, in the guise of the Soviet Union, itself caused the war – the bloodiest in European history – whose end is being commemorated.
The other countries situated between Germany and the USSR were similarly sentenced to disappear as nations – sooner or later.
A Tribute to James Wolfensohn
He also has placed the World Bank at the center of the effort to help rebuild nations emerging from devastating civil conflict, from Bosnia to Sierra Leone to East Timor.
Wolfensohn’s insistence that corruption be confronted as part of the development process was another valuable step forward.
His legacy will include a World Bank that is firmly committed to a world free of poverty.
If football and its culminating moment, the World Cup, has become the universal religion of the global age, this is above all because it fulfills, in a non-spiritual way, contradictory instincts in human nature.
In my country, France, most supporters were clearly motivated more by post-colonial references than by European allegiance.
Do you believe you can continue to ostracize the communities from which your soccer heroes come?”
The irony is that, even in that slogan’s heyday, Sino-Russian relations were deteriorating fast, culminating in spasms of combat along the Amur River in Siberia less than a decade later.
The more the US challenges the inevitable expansion of China’s “security perimeter,” the better for Russia, or so the Kremlin’s strategists appear to believe.
The more important reasons for the unease are the negative demographic trends in Russia’s far-eastern Trans-Baikal region, and the fear – shared by all of China’s neighbors – of overweening Chinese power.
On Syria, for example, the two countries have shown that we are indeed living in a multipolar world.
Russia will start to feel vulnerable, and will be pushed toward either geopolitical brinkmanship or submission to China’s will.
Most of the works held by those research libraries are still in copyright.
For most authors, that would be enough time to earn the bulk of the income that they would ever receive from their writings; after that, the works would be in the public domain.
Many European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, Israel, and New Zealand, have adopted legislation that creates a “public lending right” – that is, the government recognizes that enabling hundreds of people to read a single copy of a book provides a public good, but that doing so is likely to reduce sales of the book.
Each of us may enjoy rights.
A factor that contributed to their demise was a shift in thinking that transformed the conflict between East and West away from one that emphasized economic systems.  Instead, it was the contrast between totalitarianism and respect for rights that completely discredited the oppressive regimes linked to Moscow and helped to bring them down.
It has also led the way in creating international criminal tribunals that prosecute and punish those who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
That is why a US-China standoff is a worldwide problem.
This can best be achieved through institutional relationships based on trust, as well as deep understanding of each other’s needs and capabilities.
Such partnerships would cut by half the cost and time of experimenting and learning for the US, while avoiding redundancy and waste.
Europe, by contrast, is clearly lagging.
This is a fortunate coincidence, because shale-gas production would probably make it politically easier to phase out Poland’s economically and environmentally irrational subsidies to local coal production (and consumption).
A seldom-mentioned reason is that shale-gas development in the US has benefited from important tax incentives – a model that Europe has no reason to emulate.
Fracking is not yet a mature technology, and thus it is very likely to improve over time.
The ecological revolution that the world demands today – a transition to a low-carbon global economy and a low-carbon way of daily life – will require a similarly comprehensive change.
First, a thoroughgoing alteration of highly complex systems will be needed to preserve the world’s climate, just as such root-and-branch changes were needed 20 years ago in the postcommunist countries.
Similar acts of compromise on sustainability, measures to limit consumption, and to ensure equality will require the involvement of all stakeholders in order to gain their acceptance.
Achieving food security means ensuring that all people have consistent, affordable access to the right nutrients, despite land and water limitations, climate change, and the growing prevalence of resource-intensive Western-style diets that accompany rising incomes.
In one area of Kenya, farmers who had to travel 17 kilometers to reach an agrodealer in 2004 had to travel only four kilometers three years later.
As a result, the proportion of people living in poverty fell from 51% in 1991-92 to 28.5% in 2005-06.
In Afghanistan, eight million voters, 40% of them women, chose their first democratically elected President in 5,000 years.
In fact, as NATO Ambassador in the 1970’s, I had to fly back to testify against legislation in the US Congress to withdraw America’s forces from Europe in the middle of the Cold War.
This is why some 60 nations have joined the Proliferation Security Initiative in an effort to keep deadly weapons from dangerous regimes.
Great achievements are possible when the Atlantic community is united.
But elections by themselves don’t bring democracy.
This is where the battle lines are now drawn, and where the future of the country will be decided.
So the dividing line in Pakistan is not between liberals and extremists, but between those who support the status quo and those who oppose it.
For two and a half years, I supported Musharraf and believed his promises to bring genuine democracy to Pakistan.
For example, to make his threats of an interest-rate hike in the midst of a global slowdown credible, the ECB president is using his press conferences to tell the world how strong European growth is.
The crude oil price already has dropped substantially from its highs at the beginning of the year.
A decent settlement with public-sector workers could give Germany a “backdoor” fiscal stimulus just at the right moment – when aggregate demand is flagging.
Some climate scientists believe that 400 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is already enough to take us past the tipping point at which we risk a climate catastrophe that will turn billions of people into refugees. They say that we need to get the amount of atmospheric CO2 back down to 350 ppm.
His university, like mine and many others, has a plan to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions. Yet most of them, including Schrag’s and mine, continue to invest part of their multi-billion-dollar endowments in companies that extract and sell coal.
Those who live on this planet in future centuries will live in a hotter world, with higher sea levels, less arable land, and more extreme hurricanes, droughts, and floods.
Tolerance towards Islam is cowardly appeasement in his eyes.
Some commentators suggest that Wilders, born and raised as a Catholic in a provincial Dutch town, is, like his Muslim enemies, a true believer, driven by the goal of keeping Europe “Judeo-Christian.”
The association of elites with foreignness, tolerance, and metropolitan cities is nothing new.
The Muslim threat is, of course, not a fantasy.
This is the first time that a sitting head of state has been indicted for war crimes, with reaction around the world mainly divided between those who hailed the move as a great step for international justice and those who condemned it as colonialism.
Emboldened by the warrant and its elusive suggestion of international support, the Darfuri rebels, the Justice and Equality Movement, have walked out of peace talks with Sudan’s government.
In the Nuremberg trial of 1946, which laid the basis of current international law, the main charge against the Nazi leaders was that of “planning and waging aggressive war.”
Until the United States ratifies the ICC treaty, the Court is bound to seem to many to be little more than a politicized kangaroo court.
Its fiscal weakness limits its ability to act as global policeman.
The Watershed concept provides policymakers with a standard to use – or at the very least to debate. It is an organizing tool for policymaking: Is an international challenge a watershed or not?
Unlike the battle against the Axis, the US fought the Cold War in many ways, on many fronts, and over many decades – using politics, economics, and nuclear deterrence, as well as limited armed action, to ensure the USSR’s containment.
A year ago, Chinese and Western intellectuals competed in dismissing popular interest in Tibet as a childlike confusion with the imaginary Shangri-la of the 1937 film Lost Horizon .
In November, Chinese officials, live on national TV, ridiculed Tibetan exiles’ proposals for negotiation. They canceled a European summit because of a meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the Dalai Lama, and regularly imply that Tibetans are terrorists.
All sides would gain by paying attention to two Tibetan officials in China who dared to speak out last month.
There may not be nostalgia for the Cold War in any of this, but much of that era’s mindset can be perceived again in the arguments being knocked about.
While elimination did take place in the former Soviet Republics, the Kremlin hung on to its nuclear arsenal – the last vestige of Russia’s former superpower status.
But arms-control skeptics take issue with this.
The Obama administration repeatedly denies such claims, along with others that the treaty’s verification provisions remain insufficient.
Market logic, it is argued, dictates this result.
Before 1914, there were three international currencies: the British pound, the French franc, and the German mark.
Some worry about the stability of this world of multiple international currencies.
Compared to private investors, then, central-bank reserve managers are more likely to act as stabilizing speculators.
Europe has not solved the problem of balancing the interests of strong economies in the North and those of weaker economies in the South.
In most other regions, ongoing political divisions have their roots in the Cold War or the colonial era.
America’s failure to win any lasting geopolitical advantage through the use of military force in Iraq and Afghanistan underscore the limits of its power, while its budget crisis ensures that it will cut its military resources sooner rather than later.
We are, in short, moving to a multi-polar world.
For the sake of its own national interests, Israel must come to terms with its neighbors.
Pakistan is hit hard by a wave of monstrous Taleban attacks, and in Afghanistan NATO troops die and are terribly injured in large numbers.
American exasperation has probably been curbed by its need to borrow so much money – much of it from China.
In either of these two more optimistic scenarios, one consequence will be the transfer – actual or putative – of considerable sums of money from developed to emerging or developing countries to cover some of their costs for emissions abatement and environmental protection.
ALBERTA – As China enters the “Year of the Ox,” there is much to reflect on from the past 12 months and even more to speculate about regarding the coming year.
But it has also implemented heavy-handed police and military controls.
For example, the 30th anniversary of China’s reform movement and the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States has been a much-celebrated event this January.
In 2010, we will discover that neither has the power to keep US-Chinese relations on track.
For the foreseeable future, they will depend on local manufacturers to create the jobs that protect both China’s development goals and the Communist Party’s monopoly on domestic political power.

Most Americans care little about China's currency policy or its stance on intellectual property rights.
What matters now is whether Russia’s economy will share Yukos’s fate.
Such “state capture” occurred in Russia in the late 1990’s and to an even greater extent under the Kuchma regime in neighboring Ukraine which, ironically, Putin tried to preserve.

The prize is higher living standards for Russia’s long-suffering people and a recovery in the country’s international standing.
But, when it comes to standards – such as those governing safety, health, and the environment – the market-access requirements are brutal and binary: either you meet the established standard or you do not sell.
Indeed, our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin, intra-regional trade increases – at the expense of trade with other countries – and that developing countries tend to suffer most.
Abandoning Asia’s Poor
Social protection, housing, employment, and labor are not on the ADB’s new agenda.
So, what is the ADB’s added value, and whom does it serve?
Several countries have expressed reservations about this.
But there are moments when an individual leader’s choices can change the course of history.
Gül has been placed in this critical position because, in the last election, held in June, Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) failed to win a governing majority, much less the constitutional majority that would enable Erdoğan to transform Turkey’s parliamentary system into a presidential one.
When the AKP – which advocated a moderate form of Islamist politics that challenged the secularism that had prevailed since modern Turkey’s founding – won its first election in 2002, it was Gül who served as Prime Minister, because Erdoğan was banned from holding political office at the time.
Such a profile in courage is precisely what Turkey needs today.
Of course, Abe is far from the first Japanese leader to confront this challenge.
Moreover, some have produced portrayals of Japan, as a whole, as an unrepentant country – or, worse, as one that is hell-bent on remilitarization.
In 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung responded positively to a statement by former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
In the last two years, Japan’s stock market has almost doubled in value, increasing the wealth of Japanese consumers.
The good news is that the tax hike’s impact is temporary.
The TPP would improve Japan’s trade prospects considerably, including in sensitive sectors like agriculture, where exports of fast-moving consumer goods like flowers and vegetables would benefit.
This means compelling businesses to give up some of the special tax benefits they now enjoy.
Annual productivity growth has been stubbornly sluggish, rarely rising above 2% for much of the past two decades, reflecting both missed opportunities and declining cost competitiveness.
For starters, Japanese firms must become more globally integrated.
Others would benefit from moving beyond basic digitization to next-generation technologies, such as big-data analytics.
If Japan’s private sector rises to the challenge, it can move the economy onto a path of faster growth.
Immense trade flows, the rise of billions of new consumers in the emerging world, and technology breakthroughs are rapidly transforming the global economy.
That neglect is a human tragedy.
As a result, the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned, with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems.
Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species, but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas.
Making Do With More
It will take another generation, perhaps, before robots have completely taken over manufacturing, kitchen work, and construction; and the developing world looks to be 50 years behind.
These two traits put a great deal of bargaining power in the hands of those who control production and distribution, making them ideal for a market economy based on private property.
Polluters Must Pay

Meanwhile, the local population has remained impoverished and beset by diseases caused by unsafe air, poisoned drinking water, and pollution in the food chain.
Despite many past promises of a cleanup, Ogoniland remains in environmental agony, impoverished and sickened by the oil industry.
From now on, sustainable development must not be a mere slogan, but rather an operational approach to global governance and well-being on a strained and crowded planet.
And this problem was compounded by the timidity of in-country United Nations officials in communicating such information as they had.
The information was incomplete, but it was solid – and alarming.
Selective memory is a defense mechanism with which we are all familiar.
I refused to accept the invitation from the president of the Human Rights Council at the time, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi of Nigeria, to lead the investigation following the Human Rights Council’s January 12, 2009 resolution. As a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I felt strongly that the Council’s resolution was one-sided and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground.
For the Israelis, the public statements of Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under existential threat from which only it can protect its people.
With household wealth seriously damaged by the housing crash and other asset-price declines, pensions and retirement provisions are in disarray.
And this is just the baseline scenario.
The problem is all the more pressing because countries can achieve gains in market share not only through higher private-sector competitiveness, but also by means of protectionist measures.
So, two crucial items must claim priority at the top of the world’s economic agenda in the months ahead.
Governments, civil society, and the private sector must rise to the challenge, cooperating to find and implement creative solutions.
A targeted support program could increase substantially the efficiency of spending, freeing up resources for education, health, and poverty eradication.
Private charities, which have been instrumental in promoting innovation in fields such as health care, the environment, and education, could provide valuable insight into channeling aid more effectively.
Duty-free, quota-free access to OECD markets, complemented by simpler, more transparent rules of origin, would raise GDP by 1% in the least-developed countries, lifting millions out of poverty.
Countries undergoing a “middle-income transition” out of poor-country status frequently try to resist these changes, but doing so causes growth to slow, if not stop altogether.
Once a fiscal deal is done, government can step aside and let the private sector drive the structural changes that are needed to restore a pattern of inclusive growth.
But, while that might play well politically, the sensible conclusion is that this is not just a cyclical recovery, but rather the beginning of a delayed process of structural adaptation to a rapidly shifting global economy, to emerging economies’ growth and shifting comparative advantage, and to powerful technological forces.
The crisis, however, merely exposed the underlying imbalances and unwound some of them.
If we prepare societies for more ferocious hurricanes in the future, for example, we are also helping them to cope better with today’s extreme weather.
These are the real reasons we care about global warming.
But much of this damage will be avoided by people choosing for themselves to adapt to a change in their environment.
Reducing emissions to a level that does not extinguish economic growth could avert $3 trillion worth of damage, whereas adaptation could prevent around $8 trillion worth of damage.
As such, the long-term consequences are likely to be regrettable.
In August, the currency’s exchange-rate regime was loosened slightly.
Conceivably, over the longer term, China’s successful campaign could now open the door to lobbying by other governments to include their currencies as well. Why not add the Swiss franc or the Canadian dollar?
The political reasons for including the renminbi in the SDR are all too clear. Unfortunately, the risks of doing so are no less obvious.

Climate change will be a major driver of such events, and we risk much worse.
They point to the savings available from energy efficiency, and to the market opportunities generated by clean-energy technologies as the processes of learning and discovery take hold.
They want to promote investment and economic growth, create jobs, stabilize public finances, expand markets, turn profits, ensure reliable energy and food supplies, produce goods and services, reduce poverty, and build cities. So the primary question that we need to ask is not whether we can reduce emissions, but how public policy can help to achieve these core goals while reducing emissions and building a more climate-resilient economy.
Some major businesses are providing powerful examples of what is possible.
As science makes clear how imperative the climate question is, it is time for economists and policymakers to explain how it can be answered.
China, for example, would lose from an attack that severely damaged the American economy, and vice versa.
Nonetheless, it may be possible to identify behaviors like cyber crime that are illegal in many domestic jurisdictions.
तभी मेरे निजी जीवन के बारे में कानाफूसी होनी शुरू हो गई, और मैंने फ़ैसला कर लिया कि अब इससे बाहर आने का समय आ गया है। इसलिए अपनी लिंगीयता के बारे में चर्चा करने के लिए मैं नाइजीरिया के सबसे ज़्यादा देखे जाने वाले टीवी वार्ता शो पर जाने के लिए राजी हो गया।
इस तरह के सरकारी नज़रिए ने अफ़्रीका के समलैंगिक पुरुषों और स्त्रियों के लिए बहुत अधिक पीड़ादायक स्थिति पैदा की है। निश्चित रूप से, अनेक अफ़्रीकी देशों में समलैंगिक लोगों के लिए होमोफोबिया की क़ीमत दर्दनाक रूप से स्पष्ट है: क़ानूनी दंड, सामाजिक बहिष्कार, और भीड़ का न्याय।
नाइजीरिया में, 2005 में अपनी लिंगीयता के बारे में संदेह होने के कारण अपना कार्य खोने वाले लोगों की बढ़ती संख्या के निदान के रूप में मैंने समान अधिकारों के लिए स्वतंत्र परियोजना (TIERS) शुरू की थी। अपने पहले साल के दौरान, हमने दर्जनों लोगों को सहायता प्रदान की। एक युवक "ओलुमाइड" को तब अस्थायी आवास दिया गया जब उसके परिवार ने समलैंगिक होने के कारण उसे घर से बाहर निकाल दिया था। एक अन्य व्यक्ति "उछे" को उसकी लिंगीयता का राज़ खुलने के बाद उसे बावर्ची की नौकरी से निकाल दिया गया था। TIERS ने उसे आवास दिया और केटरिंग व्यवसाय स्थापित करने के लिए पूँजी की मदद की। हालाँकि लगभग 10 साल बीत चुके हैं, लेकिन उनके असली नाम का उपयोग करना अभी भी सुरक्षित नहीं है।
NEWPORT BEACH – Two variants of financial crisis continue to wreak havoc on Western economies, fueling joblessness and poverty: the one that we read about regularly in newspapers, involving governments around the world; and a less visible one at the level of small and medium-size businesses and households.
Indeed, they have shared only one, albeit crucial (and disappointing) feature: the inability to rely on rapid growth as the “safest” way to deleverage an over-indebted economy.
They range from subdued bank lending to unusually high risk aversion, and from discredited credit vehicles to the withdrawal of some institutions from credit intermediation altogether.
The European Central Bank is taking a similarly indirect approach.
A Rest Stop for Europe
Such a move would alleviate anxiety in the short term, thereby giving Europeans the opportunity to regroup in preparation for future steps toward a more integrated Europe and a more resilient euro.
The case for returning fiscal responsibility to national authorities is also strong – and not only because centralized fiscal authority has proved to be so inefficient.
In the United States, each state is responsible for its fiscal management, without being forced to comply with a single, overarching template.
Giving Europeans the time and space to choose more Europe would reinforce the core values upon which integration has rested for more than six decades.
But, in the early 1970’s, President Richard M. Nixon expanded the scope of affirmative action.

But, in comparing groups, it is permitted to use an individual’s status as member of an under-represented minority in his or her favor.
Things aren’t going well in Afghanistan.
There are four preconditions of the West’s success:
Nevertheless, the US at least has a Pakistan policy – which is more than can be said about NATO and Europe.
Europe would have to pay an unacceptably high price, and NATO’s future would likely be jeopardized.
For example, speaking recently in New Delhi, Secretary of State John Kerry said that the key to stabilizing Afghanistan is to build a “new silk road” connecting it with central Asia – a cynical contrivance apparently aimed at cloaking America’s failure in illusions of future commerce.
(Indeed, Karzai has reportedly already met with Taliban representatives for secret talks aimed at restarting the stalled peace initiative.)
In order to make the best of a grim situation, India must be prepared to protect its own interests at all costs.
Everything else is left to patriarchal discretion.   Here, no one will intervene except to reinforce the application of   the patriarch's rights – say, in stoning a supposedly wayward girl, or turning a blind eye to so-called “honor killings” of women.
As a result, women must be strictly secluded and made invisible when in public, for they are personally responsible for the desire that they could ignite in schools, hospitals, parks, or markets. The all-covering burqa ensures sufficient anonymity to permit women a certain amount of freedom in public space.
Yet an awareness of alternatives is seeping in through the media, even in remote provinces.
Afghanistan’s Drug-Friendly Environment
But the Taliban’s rapid rise in the 1990’s was inextricably linked to the failure of irrigation systems.
Forestry has always been a problem in Afghanistan.
Safety concerns and cost also limit intervention by international conservation organizations.
On April 16, more than 300 Afghani women – many of them students – marched together in Kabul in protest of a new law passed by Parliament that would impose a series of Taliban-like restrictions on women.
In India, for example, feminists articulated to me a vision of women’s equality that was family-centered rather than self-centered, and that valued service to community rather than personal gratification.
We know by now what our problems are as women in the West, and we know the blueprint for solving them.
This year’s record harvest of 6,100 tons of opium will generate more than $3 billion in illicit revenue – equivalent to almost half of Afghanistan’s GDP.
Senior government officials take their cut of opium revenues or bribes in return for keeping quiet.
Donors have trained police and prosecutors and built courts and detention centers.
Improving security and the rule of law must include destroying the opium trade.
To achieve this, Afghanistan needs more development assistance.
Indeed, since 1980’s the industrialization that had taken place in Africa has by and large been reversed.
The current drought covering much of East Africa – far more severe than past droughts – has been directly associated with climate change.
One conservative estimate – which has a reasonable chance of being accepted precisely because it is conservative – calls for $50 billion per year as of 2015, increasing to $100 billion by 2020 and beyond.
It is about the inappropriate priorities in how resources are allocated. It is about moral values that make it appropriate to rescue bankers, who expect everyone but themselves to pay for the mess they created, and inappropriate to compensate the world’s poorest people, whose survival is threatened precisely because of the mess created by developed countries.
African governments and businesses take a more nuanced view.
Exports from Africa to Asia increased more than sixfold between 2001 and 2011.
Much of Asia’s investment in Africa has focused on infrastructure that directly supports African priorities: telecoms, power plants and transmission lines, water and sanitation, roads and railways, ports, aviation, and airports.
DAKAR – This week, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital and a city full of symbolic importance for all of Africa, will host the Third International Conference on Financing for Development.
The good news is that there has been real progress on this front.
These incentives often deprive our governments of resources that could be used to fund essential development projects.
Africa’s Path from Poverty
Until recently, few believed that Africa, too, could become a center for modern manufacturing. But, with the right policies, there is no reason why African countries could not follow a similar trajectory.
They will become familiar with the technology and learn how to maintain consistent quality in the production line.
I moved to mainland China in 1979, when the country's per capita income was less than one-third of Sub-Saharan Africa's. Today, China has become an upper-middle-income country, and it is on track to become a high-income country by 2020.
As a result, demand for African sovereign debt has been rising steadily, and many recent issuances have been oversubscribed. When Côte d’Ivoire issued $1 billion in Eurobonds in February, demand outstripped supply by a factor of four.
The resulting lack of competition has led to prohibitive borrowing costs for governments and high exposure for banks.
On the other hand, they are in desperate need of energy, with some 1.3 billion people around the world – and two out of three Africans – currently lacking access to electricity.
As prices continue to fall and technologies mature, each dollar invested produces more power.
Indeed, the International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that the continent’s potential for wind and solar power alone amounts to more than 1.5 trillion gigawatt hours a year.
Affordable solutions to both problems are within reach, and much of the world – particularly Africa – has a unique opportunity to leapfrog to the next generation of electricity generation.
Throughout modern history, industrialization has been the most effective driver of structural poverty reduction, owing to its capacity to expand employment opportunities, boost productivity, and increase wages.
The key is effective multi-stakeholder partnerships that bring together all major players in the development process, including governments, bilateral and multilateral development agencies, national and international development finance institutions, the private sector, civil society, and even academia.
The resulting household air pollution contributes to 600,000 deaths annually – half of them children under the age of five.
So why has the market for solar power yet to take off? Part of the problem is that poor households cannot afford the up-front costs of solar technologies.
But, while it is true that more power is urgently needed, this approach ignores a few inconvenient truths.
Souley Madi is one of the most productive cotton growers in the Badjengo Cameroon, an area where the lush forests of central Africa give way to the semi-arid Sahel.
Nor does he needs expensive machinery to plant his seeds; his plow is drawn by cattle, and he pushes seeds into the ground with his bare hands.
The US and Europe offered only a token reduction, scotching a deal.
In some parts of Africa, cotton growers are expanding production, providing proof that if the US and Europe did somehow curtail their own cotton output, Africans could plug the gap.
Africa\u0027s Debt Dilemma
Still, the Jubilee campaign's street protests began a healthy debate about the lending arrangements of the IMF/World Bank.
For example, per capita growth between 1965 and 1998
These clauses have yet to be invoked, but for the sake of unity and to strengthen the solidarity of African countries, it would be advisable for the nascent African Union take the lead.
Moreover, several African countries have received ratings from credit agencies, which has opened up global financial centers to them.
Urbanization has given rise to a dynamic informal sector.
This approach, widely developed by Morocco and the Portuguese-speaking world, is epitomized by the zero-commission policy initiated by the Spanish bank Santander and its Moroccan counterpart, Attijariwafa Bank.
Africa’s Dictator-Diplomat
To his credit, child mortality was reduced by 40% under his government; Ethiopia’s economy became more diversified, with new industries like car manufacturing, beverages, and floriculture; and major infrastructure projects, including Africa’s largest hydroelectric dam, were launched.
He will be remembered for accepting the painful secession of Eritrea in 1993, rather than prolong the civil war, and for his efforts to reach an agreement with Egypt over the use of the Blue Nile waters.
For example, groups like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch have documented widespread official repression of the Oromo people.
But, thanks to prudent management of public finances during previous periods of robust growth, a significant number of African countries have endured the current crisis in better fiscal shape than during past crises.
Banks are provided with a facility to monitor their positions in real time and hence make cost-effective investment decisions.
The micro-finance business model is based on lending that is guaranteed by the group.
This will be a welcome development, because a large proportion of intra-regional trade is carried out by informal operators and small and medium enterprises that do not have access to the banking system.
Even robust China and India are experiencing slower growth, curtailed ambitions, and broken dreams.
From Ghana to Kenya, governments are having increased difficulty in raising money for infrastructure projects and selling official debt.
Remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of Africa.
In Africa, very few people borrow money for such purchases.
Trading in derivatives by investment banks, hedge funds, and other market participants, reaps huge profits for traders while depriving the real economy of productive investment and job creation.
The opposite is true for regional groupings in Africa and in the Middle East where trade with the outside world is more important than intra-regional trade.
But a sector-by-sector approach could mitigate these handicaps, and, given the pressing need to address demand for energy and climate change, it might be strategically advisable to start with the energy sector.   
Regional groups of countries in eastern, southern, and western Africa are all giving priority to the idea of creating a monetary union.
Here, the model to follow is not the euro, but Latin America’s Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
By contrast, trade among African countries accounts for only about 10-12% of the continent’s exports and imports.
What it does not require is a currency union.
As a result, West African oil producers will be earning an estimated $200 billion over the next decade, more than 10 times the sum Western countries allocate each year to the "aid industry" in the region.
This was the objective set by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which requested that the publication of multinational oil companies' payments to governments be made mandatory.
That is a shame, for here was a moment to expose the flaws of most African leaders throughout our tormented history.
Yet there he lay, and with a copy of my book The Man Died beside him.
If benchmarks such as focus, mobilization, commitment, organization, and sheer impact are any guide, then the prize goes to the media’s baleful role in preparing the Rwandan massacre of 1994, and in directing, overseeing, and stoking the fervor of the génocidaires once the extermination of Tutsis began.
African civil society, whose mouthpiece is the press, cannot escape some measure of reproach for its failure to urge leaders to rescue fellow Africans.
Africa\u0027s Quest for Power
As a result, most Africans use biomass (animal and vegetable wastes and firewood) for lighting, cooking, and heating.
Thus, institutions are rendered more democratic and governments become more transparent and responsible.
Several projects, including some in the energy sector, have been prepared or are under preparation, and four have already been approved for financing by the Bank.
The signs are already ominous.
The slave trade, colonialism, and the flawed process of colonial divestment all left their mark on Africa’s newly independent and fragile states.
But climate-change mitigation and adaptation are costly.
A nurse, Wangari counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land – for more farming.
Perhaps the most visible political support for absentee agriculture is in Liberia, a small West African country where civil war destroyed agriculture, rendering the population dependent on food imports, even today.
One key tool is the mobile phone.
Now, ordinary Lusakans want to cook similar meals in their own homes, driving demand for farmers who produce such delicacies as dried pumpkin, “black jack” leaves, and fresh Okra.
Government and rebel leaders around the globe have been put on notice that criminal conduct will no longer be given a free pass.
Similarly, in Sudan’s Darfur region, there has been no genuine peace process to disrupt, as attacks on civilians continue to be reported, even after the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the ICC in 2005. Even so, the ICC prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant for al-Bashir – announced this past July – has yet to provoke a widely-feared crackdown on humanitarian organizations.
The long history of Africa’s exploitation demands that this concern not be dismissed out of hand.
Nigeria has been convulsed by religious violence triggered by the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper months ago.
For example, among the Luhya in Western Kenya, it is not uncommon for Muslims to slaughter animals during funerals, even though, strictly speaking, there is no such provision in Islam.
It is no exaggeration to argue that the more Arabized African Muslims along the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts (including the island of Zanzibar) consider themselves “more Muslim” than the less Arabized Muslims inland.
The challenge is certainly daunting.
This makes it difficult to raise financing for all-important urban infrastructure through traditional user-pays models.
Given that so much of Africa’s urban environment is yet to be built, the continent has a unique opportunity to get it right the first time, establishing itself as a world leader in high-productivity, low-carbon development, supported by recent technological innovations.
Residents of the informal settlement of Kibera, outside Nairobi, are addressing this problem with “bio-centers” – public sanitation facilities run by locals that generate revenue from the sale of harvested methane gas.
In this process, African leaders will undoubtedly confront resistance from their societies’ vested interests.
This modern form of migration raises massive problems for countries on the receiving end.
Even in Israel, the last true immigration country - at least for Jews - assimilation is no longer so easy.
The "salad bowl" of so-called multiculturalism is no real alternative, because it does not provide the necessary glue that binds communities together. All the ingredients remain separate from the outset.
Berlin's Turkish community and the North African communities around Paris seem increasingly separate, with their own public sphere and often language.
How can confidence be restored as the crisis economies plunge into recession? How can growth be revived when austerity will almost surely mean a further decrease in aggregate demand, sending output and employment even lower?
Europe as a whole is not in bad fiscal shape; its debt-to-GDP ratio compares favorably with that of the United States.
Taking the lectures seriously – &#160;even adopting tight budget frameworks –&#160;can be counterproductive.
So many economies are vulnerable to natural disasters – earthquakes, floods, typhoons, hurricanes, tsunamis –&#160;that adding a man-made disaster is all the more tragic.
Sebetulnya, tantangan yang ditimbulkan ISIS justru menjadi seruan bagi kita untuk menerapkan beberapa tindakan, sebab tidak ada kebijakan tunggal yang memadai.
Hal ini berarti menyediakan intelijen, senjata, dan kemauan untuk menugaskan lebih banyak tentara – lebih dari 3.500 tentara Amerika sudah bertugas disana dan kemungkinan akan ada penambahan 10.000 tentara – untuk melatih, memberi masukan, dan membantu mengarahkan tindakan militer.
Secara prinsip, dan seiring berjalannya waktu, pemerintah pusat yang lebih representatif akan terbentuk, walaupun pembahasan mengenai rencana pemilihan umum dalam waktu 18 bulan ke depan nampaknya terlalu bermuluk-muluk.
Retail terrorists – individu atau kelompok melakukan serangan bersenjata ke kelompok rentan di masyarakat – sangat sulit diatasi.
If so, the global system that has secured peace, security, openness, and economic growth over the past six decades could be in grave danger.
Although many states now hide behind an alleged universal principle of inviolable state sovereignty, for example, would the international community really want to go back to the old model where states did whatever they wanted to their citizens within the confines of their own borders? Do countries around the world believe that they will be better off if the global trade system breaks down or international shipping lanes become less secure?
But, although America has been far from perfect over the last six decades, the end of the
The sudden discontinuation of the supply of petroleum and natural resources from Russia in the early 1990’s, the failure of the centrally-planned economy, and the subsequent massive famine in the mid-1990’s left North Korea’s leaders no alternative but to tolerate informal market activities.
The problem is that North Korea has no experience with collective leadership.
As a result, the economy may worsen and political instability increase.
In the wake of the death of the utopian - and often bloody - certainties of the 19th and 20th centuries (Communism's collapse was but the latest spectacular example), and with fading belief in the liberal welfare state, traditional views about work, retirement, education, the Church, solidarity, and other social institutions are changing rapidly.
Innovative start-up firms become huge companies faster than ever before.
Indeed, politics everywhere now seems dominated by the "war of lifestyles" that has emerged from today's emphasis on individual autonomy.
So long as these ideas clash, violence will lurk.
Thus, as banks return to profitability, politicians in North America and Europe have begun to talk again about new taxes that would skim those profits off to the benefit of taxpayers, whose support kept banks in business at the height of the crisis.
To paraphrase William Wordsworth, bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, and to be a derivatives trader was very heaven.
During the two decades leading up to World War I, the financial sector grew almost four times faster than the economy, in the first wave of financial deepening and globalization, but from 1918 until the 1970’s, finance expanded less rapidly than average economic growth.
Returns of 20% on equity targets are a thing of the past.
The politicians prefer to postpone the inevitable by putting public money where private money will no longer go, because doing so allows creditors to maintain the fiction that the accounting value of the Greek bonds that they hold need not be reduced.
Eliminating or reducing this trade gap without depressing economic activity and employment in Greece requires that the country export more and import less.
To see why it will be difficult for Greece to remain competitive, assume that the rest of the eurozone experiences annual productivity gains of 2%, while monetary policy limits annual price inflation to 2%.
After the Guns of August
Saudi Arabia, which had remained silent for nearly two weeks, did so with a $500 million contribution to rebuilding devastated areas of Lebanon and another billion to support Lebanon’s threatened currency.
Thus, for 300 million Arabs and more than one billion Muslims the “root cause” of the Middle East conflict is not Hezbollah. As its leader, Hassan Nasrallah aptly put it, “We are just a reaction to chronic injustice.”
CAMBRIDGE – In 2000, 189 countries collectively adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which evolved into a set of concrete targets called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
And there is evidence that they got advanced countries to pay more attention to poor nations.
Poor countries promised to refocus their development efforts while rich countries pledged to support them with finance, technology, and access to their markets.
But it is doubtful that even well-intentioned policymakers have a good handle on, say, how to raise secondary-school completion rates sustainably or reduce maternal mortality.
Advanced countries are certain to resist any new commitments.
Diplomacy, of course, should not be viewed as a favor or concession that signals “softness.”
Reasonableness does not always yield results.
In the Middle East, despite Obama’s vow to re-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, progress remained stymied by differences over the scope and content of an agreement and how to bring it about.
Finally, some of what the Obama administration chose to do (singling out Israeli settlements, for example) and how it did it (Guantánamo comes to mind) made tough situations tougher.
NEW HAVEN – The devastation – both human and physical – from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan is unfathomable. It is impossible at this point to gauge the full extent of the damage with any degree of precision.
Among emerging-markets, the Philippines and Indonesia are the most exposed to Japan, which absorbs about 16% of their total exports.
Economies grow at something much closer to their stall speeds, thus lacking the cyclical “escape velocity” required for a self-sustaining recovery.
In an era of extraordinarily high unemployment, political pressures only compound the problem.
From asset bubbles and a dysfunctional financial system to currency suppression and monetary-policy blunders, Japan has been in many respects the laboratory of our future.
Nowhere is this trend more damaging than in today’s mercantile approach to art.
Unfortunately, that is no surprise.
Are all the extremists searching for a new coherence, for a lost illusion of togetherness and a new hope of resurrection?
Aging, the Final Frontier
How can changing a single gene do this?
Interestingly, selective breeding for small dogs produced IGF-1 hormone mutants, which, as would be predicted from aging research, live much longer then large dogs.
Whether rapamycin will have the same effect in humans is not clear.
But, given the perennial allure of a longer, youthful, and healthy life, I suspect that this situation will soon begin to change.
On average, per capita income in the countries that are the source of these investments is four times higher than in the target countries.
Supporters of free markets will argue that if local landowners wish to sell their land, that is their choice to make.&#160;
But the evictions took place in 2001, and the villagers are still living in extreme poverty.
Israel’s leaders see their country’s standing in the region being seriously threatened by the emergence of a hostile Islamist regime in Egypt; the possibility that a similarly hostile regime will eventually emerge in Syria; the fragility of traditionally friendly Jordan; and the dangerous boost that the regional Islamist awakening has given to Israel’s sworn enemies, Hamas and Hezbollah.
Moreover, the conventional assumption that the region’s Sunni Arab regimes would give tacit approval to a military attack on Iran’s nuclear installations must be revisited in the wake of the Arab Spring – particularly in the aftermath of the recent, sudden upsurge in anti-American violence throughout the Muslim world.
The saddest part of the story is Israel’s utter indifference to the need to build international legitimacy for its drive to stop Iran’s nuclear program.

Likewise, the World Health Organization issued a major call to scale up development assistance for health.
In 1995, total aid for health care was around $7.9 billion.
Another $10-15 billion in annual aid (that is, roughly $10-15 more per person in the high-income world), bringing total aid to around $40 billion per year, would enable still greater progress to be made in the coming years.
FREETOWN – China’s decision to establish the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has sparked a lively debate among governments, global finance experts, and development specialists.
Our first efforts focused on developing the “software” of post-conflict development: basic education and health-care facilities, accountable economic and political governance, and the creation of new social safety nets.
These institutions’ leaders must always remember for whom they are ultimately working; local communities must be empowered to play a role in shaping the development agenda, and more must be done to engage with them directly, through a fully devolved structure.
Special attention should be devoted to areas like procurement, monitoring and supervision, and capacity building.
So far, the AIIB has not sought to amend the principle that the largest contributor to a multilateral organization gets the largest say in running it.
With the incumbents unwilling to bring China’s voting share in line with its economic might, China had little choice but to launch its own institution.
Given massive global demand for infrastructure finance – which, according to ADB estimates, will amount to $8 trillion in Asia alone over the next decade – the AIIB should not be considered a threat to the World Bank, the ADB, or other multilateral lenders.
The AIIB and Chinese Strategy
Founded in 1966, the ADB has been led ever since by Japan and the United States, owing to their combined total of 15.7% investment in the bank’s capital.

For example, Steve Walt and John Mearsheimer, in their notorious essay “The Israel Lobby,” asserted that AIPAC manufactured the Iraq War.
He also put AIPAC in the same category as the Republicans who “were responsible” for leading the US into the Iraq war.
It is increasingly identified with the Republican agenda and Israel’s evangelical Christian supporters, even though polls have repeatedly shown that Jews are America’s most liberal ethnic group.
More dangerous, Netanyahu could achieve his next goal: preventing a strategic détente between the US and Iran that would enable cooperation in resolving major regional conflicts, from Yemen to Syria.
Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO) menyebutnya “satu-satunya risiko kesehatan lingkungan hidup yang terbesar” dan memperkirakan 90% penduduk Eropa terpapar dengan polusi outdoor yang melebihi batas kualitas utama berdasarkan pedoman WHO.
Di saat para politisi Eropa berpendapat perlindungan lingkungan hidup akan melemahkan perekonomian Eropa yang sudah memburuk, tentu tidak mengejutkan bila upaya mengurangi polusi udara tidak berhasil.
Inti dari upaya Tiongkok adalah meningkatnya penggunaan transportasi publik, perdagangan hijau (green trade), dan penyempurnaan campuran energi (energy mix).
Eropa, sebagai salah satu wilayah terkaya di dunia, selayaknya berada di baris terdepan dalam upaya menggalakkan keberlanjutan lingkungan hidup.
When legislators finally enacted the enabling legislation in May 2013, victims were dismayed to discover that the commission would be allowed to recommend amnesties for crimes against humanity, in contravention of international principles and United Nations guidelines.
Half-measures will not do.
Human suffering and victims’ dignity are too powerful to be erased by others’ political pacts. Eventually, the past demands its due: justice is not just an ideal; it is an investment in a better future.
He thought that he was giving balanced testimony to Congress on government budget issues.
Against them you have to set what former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers calls Greenspan’s “golden glove” performance at avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years at the Fed.
And Greenspan eschews paternalism: he would not assume the role of a regulator telling people that they cannot buy a house even though a lender is willing to finance it.
But even in the absence of overarching global legal frameworks, it is possible to maintain a sense of common security if the terms of resource investments are founded on long-term political understanding and commercial relationships, rather than short-term competition.
Given Egypt’s concerns about potential water shortages arising from Ethiopia’s new upstream hydropower plants, its assent is far from assured.
The political risks of investing in Nigeria’s agriculture sector are also rising as a result of the country’s demographic explosion, high inflation, weak rule of law, and insecure land rights, with wider political consequences.
We know what needs to be done, why it is important, and who must be involved to secure our planet’s long-term future.
In a world of limited and scarce resources, countries and companies will be forced to make decisions that affect one another’s security.
Australia, for example, is a large coal exporter but imports most of its refined fuels and holds just three days of fuel stockpiles.
For example, tropical rainforests play a crucial function in maintaining stable weather and rainfall, acting as a “pump” that helps moisture travel between different regions.
Some of these multilateral processes – in particular, those seeking an ambitious global climate agreement – appear to be moving in slow motion and against the grain of geopolitical interests.
For many, Alexander Hamilton has become a contemporary hero.
There is, he maintained, “an intimate connection between public virtue and public happiness.”
He proposed a model of joint-stock banking on a national scale, which ran into immediate opposition (curiously, his proposal was much more influential in Canada).
The Civil War revealed the centrality of a common foundation of morality to Hamilton’s approach to debt and public finance.
Just as presidential elections in the United States matter for the entire world, mayoral elections in Moscow matter for Russia’s national politics – and thus for its economy.
The most important indication of this is the participation of Alexei Navalny – by far the Kremlin’s most persistent political opponent.
Navalny’s campaign is crowd-funded by ordinary Russians, who understand that he is not on the payroll of an oligarch or the government.
Elem Klimov’s cinematic magnum opus “Come and See” depicted World War II without the heroics on which we were reared, highlighting the tremendous human suffering instead.
War and post-war lived in the home of our soul.”
Public reaction to both was mixed.
While this brutally matter-of-fact tone can make readers uneasy (indeed, it was one reason why I took so long to read the book), we cannot afford to be ignorant of the truth, even – or perhaps especially – if it makes us squirm.
Moreover, this summer, the writer and literary critic Sarah Danius became the first woman in 200 years to serve as the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which chooses the Nobel laureate in literature.
Greece wants them back.
The systematic study of persuasion began during World War II, when the US Army recognized that fighting a nation mesmerized by Hitler would require bolstering troop motivation and rallying popular support for the war.
At that point, only one conclusion is possible: The plundered Marbles must be reunited in their historical home and exhibited to the world as the ancient artists intended.
Countries that did not experience recent bank meltdowns, such as Canada, Australia, China, Brazil, and India, are unenthusiastic.
During the crisis, taxpayers were on the hook for almost a quarter of national income.
By contrast, some finance specialists favor forcing banks to rely much more on “contingent” debt that can be forcibly converted to (possibly worthless) stock in the event of a system-wide meltdown.
And what about the second tax proposed by the IMF, on banks’ profits and bonuses? Such a tax is politically appealing, but ultimately it makes little sense – except, perhaps, in a crisis year when bank subsidies are glaringly transparent.
About 600,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands made into refugees.
Third, successive governments widened the ethnic divide through catastrophically predatory governance.
Violence only receded in 2003, when the main rebel group, the
Yet it would be dangerous to redress past imbalances solely at the expense of traditional beneficiaries, especially because they remain powerful enough to derail the peace process.
But unemployment has risen even faster and further than expected.
It will encourage the reemergence of global imbalances.
Rather, it is emerging markets like China.
And lowering administrative barriers to imports might redirect more spending toward foreign goods than the authorities intend.
For China, leadership means assuming additional risks.
The mystique of immense wealth, noble birth, and great exclusivity is further sustained by the global mass media that promote these rituals.
This is the vengeful side of our fawning, as though the humiliation of worshipping idols must be balanced by our delight in their downfall.
Monarchies are often popular with minorities.
That is what she means when she preaches tolerance and mutual understanding.
Alliances of the Air
The choice, they aver, is a purely professional one, made by the Indian Air Force, and only ratified by the ministry.
At a time when US nuclear-reactor purchases – made possible by the historic deal negotiated by the Bush administration – have been held up by US insistence on exemptions from supplier liability in the event of an accident, some regard India’s spurning of US aircraft as a gratuitous rejection of an opportunity to demonstrate that friendship with India helps America, too.
The US, too, has a strong interest in Indian strategic autonomy, which would be buttressed by a wider range of external partnerships, including with the European states that will benefit from the aircraft tender.
Against the backdrop of the sub-prime crisis, the disasters at many financial institutions, and the weakening of the stock market, these “masters of the universe” seemed less omniscient than they did a short while ago.
But one lesson of modern finance theory is that, in well functioning financial markets, repackaging risks should not make much difference.
This time, a vote at the end of the session supported my view by a margin of three to one. 
Unfettered markets may produce big bonuses for CEO’s, but they do not lead, as if by an invisible hand, to societal well-being.
Technically, reducing a deficit is a straightforward matter: one must either cut expenditures or raise taxes.
Even if this widens the deficit in the short run, it will reduce the national debt in the long run.
Then there are the seemingly endless giveaways of national resources – from the free spectrum provided to broadcasters to the low royalties levied on mining companies to the subsidies to lumber companies.
Why should we doubt that some people act altruistically, at least some of the time? In evolutionary terms, we can easily understand altruism toward kin and others who can reciprocate our help.
In the US alone, individuals gave $240 billion to charity in 2013.
After all, as Geffen presumably knew, the family of Avery Fisher had to be compensated with a payment of $15 million in order to agree to the renaming.
To achieve their aims, they use reason and evidence to ensure that whatever resources they devote to doing good will be as effective as possible.
Predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s, let alone preventing or curing it, remains an immense challenge.
Indeed, the risk of Alzheimer’s doubles if a parent or sibling has it, probably due in large part to the presence of the ApoE gene.
Memory and other cognitive tests can reveal whether one has minor problems with some aspects of thinking – a condition known as “mild cognitive impairment” that precedes Alzheimer’s disease.
The Experts’ Advantage
We see similar findings in other fields. My research shows that the world’s best universities, for example, are likely to be led by exceptional scholars whose performance continues to improve over time.
This sort of leadership arrangement creates a virtuous circle.
Ambivalent Arabia
Not long after the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, these liberal reformers joined with 160 other professionals to write and sign a petition to Crown Prince Abdullah asking for reforms.
Those who submitted had their passports withdrawn, lost their jobs, and were forbidden to speak to the press.
This silence is vital to the princes, for what the al-Saud care about most is US support.
Under Bouteflika’s leadership, Algeria’s government has failed to address the country’s most pressing economic and social challenges.
But, to gain credibility, the opposition parties will have to extend their criticism beyond Bouteflika to the system as a whole.
With the civil war of the 1990’s long over, security officials cannot explain why Algerians are being arrested for demanding jobs.
In this context, the failure of the government’s half-baked attempts to buy off protesters is unsurprising.
But it would take a medium-sized political miracle for these hopes not to be disappointed, and such a miracle will not happen – whoever is elected.
Another piece of bad (or good?) news is that a more multilateral American policy will increase the pressure on Europeans to take on more responsibility for international crisis management and conflict resolution – in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East, Transcaucasia, and Russia, and with respect to Turkey’s future.
In light of these developments, does it still make sense to speak of “the West”? I believe it does, more than ever, because the rift between Europe and America leaves both sides substantially weaker in global terms.
And that is a good thing.
Let us start with some simple aeronautic dynamics, using an analogy that my PIMCO colleague, Bill Gross, came up with to describe the economic risks facing the American economy.
The private sector alone cannot and will not counter the risk of stall speed.
Underlying it all was a willingness to evolve – a drive for perfection through experimentation.
America, China, and the Productivity Paradox
And this time the downturn is global in scope, affecting the world’s two largest economies, the US and China, most of all.
With revolutionary technologies now driving the creation of new markets (digital media and computerized wearables), services (energy management and DNA sequencing), products (smartphones and robotics), and technology companies (Alibaba and Apple), surely productivity growth must be surging.
Indeed, white-collar knowledge workers – that is, most workers in advanced economies – are now tethered to their workplaces essentially 24 hours a day, seven days a week, a reality that is not reflected in the official statistics.
But there will come a time when this tailwind subsides and China begins to converge on the so-called frontier of the advanced economies.
NEW YORK – In the coming decades, nothing will matter more for global peace, prosperity, and governance than how the United States and China handle the ongoing shift in their relative power.
Is there another way to manage the relationship that, while reflecting the reality of these forces and mindsets on both sides, would not risk turning legitimate competition into dangerous confrontation? In a new report for the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Kevin Rudd, former Australian Prime Minister and now head of the Asia Society Policy Institute, outlines just such a strategy, which he calls “constructive realism”.
China’s rise will continue, and the world – including the US – will have to find principled ways of peacefully accommodating it.
He meant it to refer to Europe's divisions, but in May, ten additional states joined the European Union.
Political arrangements are somewhat more problematic.
Not only would it add to anti-American attitudes and fail to accomplish its objectives, but it over-estimates the extent to which the new Europe is being formed in opposition to the US.
If one looks at foreign direct investment, it is clear that the two sides of the Atlantic are closely integrated.
At the insistence of the United States, an earlier reference by the G-20 to a definite date for completing the Doha Round was dropped.
Perhaps the chief mistake, as with recent “Buy American” provisions in US legislation, was to allow the Employ American Workers Act (EAWA) to be folded into the stimulus bill.
But this would be discriminatory toward developing countries that do not have duty-free access, helping Pakistan at their expense.
But there are strong quantitative parallels as well.
Americans firmly told Japan that the only way to clean up its economy was to purge insolvent banks and regenerate the financial system through Schumpeterian “creative destruction.”
America should start to listen before it is too late.
Most important, the ACA is providing incentives for the creation of “affordable care organizations,” “bundled payment systems,” and other delivery innovations to encourage better coordination of care, especially for patients with numerous chronic conditions.
In a recent study, the CEA concluded that the ACA’s Medicare reforms account for a significant share of the slowdown.
The remarkable success in Camden has prompted the foundation to fund similar experiments in Boston, Cleveland, Cincinnati, western Michigan, and Humboldt County, California.
And health-care reform is just one example in which government can deliver what the public wants by setting goals, encouraging creativity, and providing the resources to scale up what works.
American citizens’ resistance to moderating energy consumption for the sake of the global environment is much more deeply embedded.
The change of position by the
One hopes that it changes course soon, before we all are forced to wear swimsuits to work.
So the countries that benefit from this largesse have a responsibility to speak up for the constituents who help keep their economies afloat.
Undocumented workers thus enter the cycle of those who live and drive with nearly throwaway cars that cost between $200 and $700.
Instead, Schwarzenegger, like other Americans, makes laws in the belief that nine million undocumented workers do not matter.
It is precisely the failure to apply these values in areas such as Palestine or Iraq that has made – and can still make – countless Arabs vehemently anti-American.
Pulling away from dictators without trying to take credit for or hijack the revolt was exactly what was required.
But what the Arab countries couldn’t do with military support, they were able to do by providing political cover for the military intervention led by the US, Britain, and France.
A New Low for China Bashing
Fixated on stability – a concept alien to US politicians and policymakers – the Chinese prefer, instead, to play a more active role in managing the adjustment of their currency.
While these trends benefit Chinese workers, they also support America and other countries by holding down inflation and making it possible for their companies to cope with tough competitive pressures.
They are all part of an enormous multilateral trade deficit that stems from America’s unprecedented shortfall of saving – a depreciation-adjusted “net national saving rate” (combining businesses, households, and the government sector) that has been negative since 2008.
Indeed, one could argue that it is the American public that is being manipulated by the erroneous charges leveled at China.
Or is it? Whatever it has been in the past, the US in the future will have to choose whether, and how much, it will be a social democracy.
It was during this era – roughly from 1948 to 1973 – that sociologists found that a majority of Americans had come to define themselves not as working class, but as middle class.
America was thus a special place.
Indeed, former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Paul Volcker sees the US as so macroeconomically vulnerable as to be running a 75% chance of a full-fledged dollar crisis over the next several years.
To an even greater extent, however, the motivation that spurred the human-rights movement was revulsion worldwide, including in the US, against American aid to Pinochet’s forces, a policy directed by President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
Maintaining the international prohibition on the use of chemical weapons is an urgent concern.
At the beginning of the campaign, many observers predicted that Iraq would be the major issue in 2008.
That effort appears to have backfired, because the Republicans that he leads initially balked at passing the legislation.
Thus, the two candidates’ campaigns are focusing heavily on a dozen or so states in which voters are closely divided and could sway the electoral college outcome. Each campaign is now desperately trying to gauge the impact of the financial crisis on these battleground states.
Some people worry that Obama might be good for American soft power, but not for its hard power.
It is no surprise that stock markets liked the results of the stress tests that US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner administered to America’s big banks, for the general outcome had been leaked weeks before.
They knew that if the true conditions at many big banks were publicly revealed, many would have been immediately declared bankrupt, necessitating government receivership to stop a tsunami of bank runs.
Markets had factored into share prices the belief that the US government would not allow any more banks to collapse.
Meanwhile, Wall Street chieftains and their boards of directors have nothing to fear from government.
It also sets a limit on how much debt the US Treasury is allowed to issue.
In the meantime, both sides risk disrupting transfer payments (including to the elderly) and the provision of public services, as well as eroding further America’s global credit standing.
This two-step process would be similar to what happened in 2008, when Congress was confronted with another cliffhanger: the Bush administration’s request for $700 billion to prevent a financial-market collapse and an economic depression.
The world economy is hard-wired to the assumption of a strong America, and Americans benefit from this.
Usually, low interest rates lead firms to borrow more to invest more, and greater indebtedness is matched by more productive assets.
And Alan Greenspan egged them to pile on the risk by encouraging these variable-rate mortgages.
Others found that as interest rates rose, they simply could not make their payments.
America’s Deepening Moral Crisis
A quotation by President John F. Kennedy states that high tax rates can strangle the economy, but Kennedy’s was speaking a half-century ago, when the top marginal tax rates were twice what they are today.
Americans seem to believe that they have a natural right to government services without paying taxes.
The big campaign contributors to both parties pay to ensure that their vested interests dominate political debates.
Swedes recently gave enough votes to a right-wing, anti-immigrant party to give it representation in parliament, reflecting a growing backlash against the rising number of immigrants in Swedish society.
The differences between the candidates are considerable, and highly consequential for American economic policy and the global economy, although enactment of their programs will depend on the makeup of Congress.
Taxes. Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages, capital gains, dividends, interest, and estates, especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses.
The Obama campaign is pummeling Romney on Medicare, and the Romney campaign is hammering Obama for his refusal to negotiate or even propose a solution.
Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms, industries, or the entire economy.
America’s Employment and Growth Challenges
Let’s be clear: elevated savings and reduced consumption relative to pre-crisis levels are likely to be permanent even after households reduce leverage and restore retirement savings – a process that in the US has removed roughly $1 trillion from the demand side of the economy.
But, given the US housing market’s fragility, raising interest rates could cause prices to plummet, sinking the economy again.  Despite their complaints, it is not clear that emerging economies would prefer another deep US downturn to the current flood of inbound capital that that they must manage.
But climbing out will be difficult and painful.
America’s Employment Dilemma
This is not to say that the Obama administration did not try to boost employment.
Moreover, the Fed became gun-shy and did not continue to increase its balance sheet beyond $2 trillion.
But will Congress act quickly? Given the depth of political polarization in the US, and thus the need for 60 of 100 votes in the Senate to end a Republican filibuster, there is no sign of it being able to do so.
It has not always been this way.
In fact, whenever the world looks unstable, investors want to hold more dollar assets – even when the US is the cause of the instability.
The calculation is that this will prove politically popular (probably true) while making it easier to implement spending cuts down the road (less obvious).
All of these problems can be solved only through long-term sustainable economic development.
Since 2001 the US has supported Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan with more than $10 billion in aid, and now faces an unstable regime that just barely survives.
The authors note that “the strategic direction for Pakistan was set early by a narrow circle at the top of the Bush administration and has been largely focused on the war effort rather than on Pakistan’s internal situation.”
A more peaceful world will be possible only when Americans and others begin to see things through the eyes of their supposed enemies, and realize that today’s conflicts, having resulted from desperation and despair, can be solved through economic development rather than war. We will have peace when we heed the words of President John F. Kennedy, who said, a few months before his death, “For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
Some were unable; others were unwilling.
Indebted farmers physically disabled the repayment machinery in many states, most famously in Shay’s Rebellion in Massachusetts.
Yet, it was no accident that two military men were key to making the US a “respectable nation” in financial terms.
They were expected to be adamant – an outcome that could well have brought about the young country’s demise.
Today’s trajectory is the reverse of that of the 1780’s and 1790’s.
Its proponents also understood that the war would not be limited to weapons, but would need to be a sustained effort, involving, as they put it, the “whole of government,” with civilian agencies marshaled behind military – or paramilitary – objectives.
America’s fiscal crisis is profound, and it is not just about numbers.
Can they, and other Americans who are losing vital services, really be expected to rise above it all and support funding to build new schools in Afghanistan?
In short, diplomacy – and US diplomacy, in particular – often involves money.
And, two weeks ago, the UN met again on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Again, Washington lobbyists have bought into the absurd claim of trade experts such as Fred Bergsten that the gain from Doha, as it stands now, is a paltry $7 billion or so annually.
What we need today is for the world’s leading statesmen to stop pussyfooting and to unite in nudging Obama towards a successful conclusion of the Doha Round.
As a result, many global challenges – climate change, trade, resource scarcity, international security, cyber-warfare, and nuclear proliferation, to name a few – are bound to loom larger.
So, as America curtails its global leadership, it will find itself in more demand.
Over the long term, however, US policymakers must make steady progress in restoring confidence in the nation’s fiscal health by cutting politically sacred programs like social security, Medicare, and defense.
Obama kept his promise to withdraw American forces from Iraq during his first term.
Notwithstanding Obama’s skillful response to the Arab Spring – the only strategic surprise that he has faced as president – his credibility in the Muslim world has steadily declined.
After the Vietnam War, Jimmy Carter hoped to make a break with established US policy.
And the US cannot reach an accord with Pakistan without India’s consent, which America would be unable to force, especially given that it relies on India to counterbalance China’s growing clout in Asia.
It didn’t matter what you could see with your own eyes.
The second application of Groucho’s question was that citizens of most Communist countries soon learned that the loss of freedom that they suffered was not compensated by greater prosperity or a higher quality of life. The more that Russians, Poles, Czechs, and others saw of the life-style in the Western democracies, the more they questioned their own system.
This is what appeared to happen in the last Indian election, and the election in the United States of President Barack Obama was also plainly a supremely rational moment.
Yet Obama’s attempts to reform health care have run into hysterical opposition.
To understand why, let’s start with the cyclical recovery.
That growth of the labor force will raise potential GDP by only about 0.5% per year.
The effect of a decline in the dollar over the coming decade could be equally important.
Easy access to guns in the US leads to horrific murder rates relative to other highly educated and wealthy societies.
Before the crackdown, there had been 13 such massacres in 18 years.
The slaves – and generations of their descendants – were routinely murdered.
Simply put, freedom in the twenty-first century does not depend on unregulated gun ownership.
The perpetrators are not hardened criminals; many have no previous criminal record.
For several years, I argued that America’s economy was being supported by a housing bubble that had replaced the stock market bubble of the 1990’s.
Booming home prices gave Americans the confidence, and the financial wherewithal, to spend more than their income.
Sometime in the future, payments would rise, but borrowers were told, again, not to worry: house prices would rise faster, making it easy to refinance with another negative amortization loan. The only way (in this view) not to win was to sit on the sidelines.
But lower short-term interest rates have led to higher medium-term interest rates, which are more relevant for the mortgage market, perhaps because of increasing worries about inflationary pressures.
It is the victims of predatory lenders who need government help.
But we are not seeing signs of anything like this.
From their perspective, today’s high demand for long-term dollar-denominated securities is easily explained: Asian central banks are buying in order to hold down their currencies, the US Treasury is borrowing short (and thus not issuing that many long-term securities), and US companies are not undertaking the kinds of investments that would lead them to issue many long-term bonds.
Only businesses that can borrow long-term now, lock in a low real interest rate, and invest in expanding their capacity can make the domestic bet that interest rates will rise.
As the intense US debate about President Barack Obama’s proposed use of military force highlights, the attack-Syria push is not about upholding America’s national interest.
Meanwhile, America’s support for the regimes in Yemen and Saudi Arabia has contributed to the rise of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
By supporting Islamist rulers, the US is contributing to a trend evident from the Maghreb to the badlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan – Muslims killing Muslims.
His sentiment seems more apt than ever nowadays, but not because humanity has turned pacifistic.
From a legal and human-rights point of view, the US drone program is even more alarming.
The killings must be proportionate, strategically necessary, and publicly justified.
And, unlike military personnel, CIA agents enjoy extensive immunity, undermining international legal standards.
Nobody knows whether the debt-ceiling tripwire will be evaded; if so, how; or what will happen if it is not.
Another six months should not be lost.
Solving any of these three problems would go a long way toward resolving the long-run financing imbalance between current tax rates and America’s long-run social-insurance promises that the debt-ceiling debate’s instigators supposedly want to address.
If it is, the world needs to develop other institutions for global management – and quickly.
What’s missing in the debate is the Latin American context.
Five years ago, Mexico’s President Vicente Fox tried to convince Bush that something had to be done before a nativist backlash in the US complicated its relations with Latin America and made goals such as a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) impossible.
That is unfortunate, because Fox will not be around forever.
To be sure, Iran’s alliances are vulnerable to erosion and, in the case of two staunch allies, Syria and Venezuela, to outright collapse.
Moreover, America has refused to pay the Kremlin’s high price – curtailment of congressional human-rights legislation, repeal of Cold-War-era restrictions on Russian-US trade, and abandonment of plans for ballistic missile defense in Europe – for Russian support on Iran (or, for that matter, on any other trouble spot, such as Syria).
By contrast, North Korea shows that defiance, rather than accommodation, is a strategy that works.
This reduction reflects the cuts in government spending on defense and non-defense programs mandated by the budget “sequester” that took effect in March, as well as the rise in revenue caused by higher rates for income and payroll taxes since the end of 2012.
Officials and others who favor stimulating growth through increased government spending ignore the CBO’s more realistic alternative scenario.
The weaker dollar reduces the US standard of living.
America’s New Trade Hypocrisy
The developing countries were disappointed with the results of Europe’s EBA initiative, and Europe has responded by committing itself to dealing with at least part of the problem that arises from the rules of origin tests.
For Bangladesh, this implies that 75% of the tariff lines, accounting for more than 90% of the value of its exports to the US, could be excluded from duty-free treatment.
The US has already had some success in pitting the poor against each other.
The oil company BP is discovering that right now.
Nor would I seek to downplay the full horror of what has happened.
The EU is the largest trading block in the world, and it has coped with the rise of China in the global marketplace far better than America or Japan has.
The introduction of the euro was supposed to spur the less dynamic and competitive European economies, mostly in the south of the continent, to drive down their costs and increase their competitiveness. Then they could converge with the more efficient and prudently managed economies, like Germany.
We can’t live forever in the past, magnificent as its relics may be.
To be sure, international finance economists also see US exports benefiting as the value of the dollar declines, but the lags in demand are such that the export boost will come a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending.
I’m not wise enough to say which side is right, but I certainly know which side I hope is wrong.
Both bubbles have long since burst, and US households are now dealing with post-bubble financial devastation – namely, underwater assets, record-high debt, and profound shortages of savings.
The 30% mainly consists of four components – capital spending by firms, net exports (exports less imports), residential construction, and government purchases.
Capital spending and exports, which together account for about 24% of GDP, hold the key to this shift. At just over 10% of GDP, the share of capital spending is well below the peak of nearly 13% in 2000.
Improvement on all counts is vital for America’s competitive revival.
Don’t believe it.
In recent speeches and discussions with current and former central bankers, I have been criticized for focusing too much on the 0.9% trend of the past 21 quarters and paying too little attention to the 2% recovery phase of the post-crisis period.
The worst consumer recession in modern history, featuring a record collapse in durable-goods expenditures in 2008-2009, should have triggered an outsize surge of pent-up demand.
But are these newfound wealth effects really all that they are made out to be?
BERKELEY – The odds are now about 36% that the United States will be in a recession next year.
And we have seen Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach explore the possibility of removing President Barack Obama from the ballot in Kansas, because, Kobach suggested, Obama is “not a natural-born citizen.”
This view clearly influences Republican office-holders, who fear the partisan beast that mans their campaigns’ phone banks and holds the purse strings.
It seems to me that the odds are around 60% that real negotiation will not begin until tax rates go up on January 1.
This scenario would grant the US three enormous advantages.
Could the US ignore a country that in roughly ten years will become the world’s second-largest oil exporter, generating more than $200 billion annually in revenue, while increasingly being dominated by an authoritarian Shia regime that is close to Iran? Would it withdraw in the face of the consequent strategic threat to its three allies – Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel – in the region?
Its involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will likely be limited to maintaining the status quo rather than seeking a comprehensive settlement.
Nor are there any signs of America’s economic hegemony starting to fold under the weight of maintaining its unilateral military dominance.
They point to worsening income inequality, as images beamed worldwide from post-hurricane New Orleans illustrated all too clearly.
Nevertheless, I suspect that the age of American exceptionalism is near an end, and soon per capita income in Europe and Japan will approach that of the US, rather than falling farther behind.
The unwinding of the US economy might even begin in 2006, particularly if Japan continues to grow out of its doldrums, the US housing market softens dramatically, and Europe’s economic recovery accelerates.
Blindsided by the crisis of 2007-2008, the Fed has compounded its original misdiagnosis of the problem by repeatedly doubling down on tactical responses, with two rounds of QE preceding the current, open-ended iteration.
Gains in inflation-adjusted personal-consumption expenditure have averaged a mere 0.8% over the past five years – the most severe and protracted slowdown in consumer demand growth in the post-World War II era.
But converting underwater “non-recourse” mortgage loans, where only the house is at risk, into so-called “recourse liabilities,” for which nonpayment would have consequences for all of a borrower’s assets, could address this concern, while simultaneously tempering America’s culture of leverage with a much greater sense of responsibility.
His focus was on corporate decision-making and misaligned incentives leading to a worrisome dichotomy between the short-term tactics of “operational effectiveness” (cost cutting, outsourcing, and reengineering) and the long-term visionary bets that frame successful strategies.
As in many countries, conflicts over public morality and national strategy come down to questions of money.
The poor are squeezed by cuts in social programs and a weak job market.
It makes sense to tax them more.
Yet when the actual budget proposals are made, there will be a growing backlash.
The problem for the rich is that, other than military spending, there is no place to cut the budget other than in areas of core support for the poor and working class. Is America really going to cut health benefits and retirement income?  Will it really balance the budget by slashing education spending at a time when US students already are being out-performed by their Asian counterparts?
Yet the time for change will come.
If a homeowner defaults, creditors can take the house, but they cannot take other property or income to make up any unpaid balance.
Until house prices stabilize, these securities cannot be valued with any confidence.
The low interest rate helped by making the dollar more competitive, but otherwise monetary policy appears to have lost traction because of the condition of the housing sector and the dysfunctional state of the credit markets.
A year ago, the two countries did not even have ambassadors in each other’s capitals.
In 1990, when the NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, the junta promptly voided the results and arrested Suu Kyi.
This has not always been the case.
NEW YORK – For seven years, the United States has allowed its fixation on the renminbi’s exchange rate to deflect attention from far more important issues in its economic relationship with China.
Obama’s presumptive Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, has promised to declare China guilty of currency manipulation the day he takes office.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that China’s current-account surplus will narrow to just 2.3% of GDP in 2012, after peaking at 10.1% in 2007.
With households focused on repairing severely damaged balance sheets, inflation-adjusted private consumption has expanded at an anemic 0.5% average annual rate over the past four years.
At just 43% of GDP, China’s services sector is relatively tiny.
The United States' planned withdrawal of troops from Asia, which President George W. Bush announced on August 16, need not harm peace and stability in the region and particularly in Korea.
The US Defense Department justifies this change as part of the so-called "Global Posture Review" that it has been carrying out to provide more flexibility and mobility in deploying troops to more urgently needed places around the world.
Yet the Bush administration insists: "The US views South Korea as a strong and steadfast ally. We are committed to South Korea's security and to our alliance and partnership with Seoul."
America’s Saving Rate and the Dollar’s Future
Individuals now have to save more to prepare for retirement, and retirees have less wealth to spend.
But this direct link between higher household saving and a lower dollar will only be forged if higher household saving is not outweighed by a rise in government dis-saving, i.e., by a larger government deficit.
The higher interest rate will reduce the level of business investment and residential construction until they can be financed with the smaller volume of national saving plus the reduced capital inflows.
Saving may also take the form of individual contributions to retirement accounts or employer contributions to corporate saving plans.
Moreover, the increased availability of credit cards gave Americans a greater ability to dissave, buying goods and services now and paying for them later.
There is no way to predict what the saving rate will do next.
That would leave a net national saving rate of just 2.5% of GDP.
So a company that fires all its workers and then ships from stock can look very productive – until it runs outs of stock.
This deficit reflects an underlying research deficit.
Indeed, in many cases, the CEO – frequently a Wall Street-endorsed “superstar” parachuted in to “shake things up” – now
While American economists, politicians, and business leaders have for years sought to sell their model of management abroad, many companies elsewhere have not been buying it.
This is why the Bush administration has shied away from military confrontations with North Korea and Iran, despite its veneration of Israel’s air strike on Iraq’s Osirak reactor in 1981, which set back Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program by several years.
At least part of the problem is that it is dealing with complex social forces that are not organized into centralized hierarchies that can enforce rules, and thus be deterred, coerced, or otherwise manipulated through conventional power.
But the fundamental problem remains the lopsided distribution of power in the international system.
President Barack Obama’s instincts may be an exception here, but he is fighting powerful hidebound forces in the United States, as well as a demagogic populism, in the form of the Tea Party, that is far worse – and that might defeat him in 2012, seriously damaging America in the process.
The expenditure cuts mandated by the outcome of the debt-ceiling debate will reduce economic activity, thereby undermining growth and making debt reduction even more difficult.
If this forces America back towards what the international-relations scholar Joseph Nye calls “soft power and multilateral diplomacy,” it may well be a good thing.
America’s Sleeping Watch Dog
It was the summer of 2000 when I began asking Republicans I know – generally people who might be natural candidates for various sub-cabinet policy positions in a Republican administration – how worried they were that the Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, was clearly not up to the job.
He was not just incurious, but also arrogant: he insisted on making uninformed decisions, and hence made decisions that were essentially random.
Or it could be remembered as another “Sputnik moment,” when, as with the Soviet foray into outer space in 1957, the American people realized that the country had lost its footing and decided it was time for the United States to get its act together.
Today, from Iran to Darfur to Zimbabwe to Georgia, the world is witnessing the effects of a budding post-American world, and the picture does not look pretty.
The world community is not there yet, and until it is, the world needs a new kind of American leader – a leader able to inspire Americans to fix their problems at home and work with partners across the globe in promoting a common agenda as bold and progressive as the order built from the ashes of World War II 60 years ago.
Indeed, the revolution in non-conventional hydrocarbons, particularly shale gas and oil, which the International Energy Agency recently predicted would make the US the world’s largest oil producer by 2020, and the top energy producer overall by 2030, will have enormous global repercussions.
The latest eruption of violent conflict between Hamas and Israel underscores the importance of reviving the peace process.
Since its victory in the Cold War, America’s global hegemony has rested on three pillars: economic power, military might, and a vast capacity to export its popular culture.
Indeed, what will now shape the future of the region is not democracy, but the violent divide between Shiites and Sunnis that the Iraq war precipitated.
The calamitous US military experience in Iraq has left it strategically diminished.
Politicians can make endless promises, but if the budget doesn’t add up, politics is little more than mere words.
He spelled out a vision of future growth in which public and private investment would be complementary, mutually supportive pillars.
That contradiction highlights the sad and self-defeating nature of US budget policies over the past 25 years, and most likely in the years to come.
Both political parties, and the White House, would rather cut taxes than spend more on education, science and technology, and infrastructure.
America’s Unhinged “Pivot”
In fact, after raising Asians’ expectations of a more robust US response to China’s growing assertiveness, the Obama administration has started to tamp down the military aspects of its “pivot,” emphasizing instead greater US economic engagement.
Concern for its own national interest explains why America has charted a course of tacit neutrality regarding the revival of Sino-Indian territorial disputes, including China’s sudden resurrection of a claim to the large Himalayan Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.
The Asia-Pacific region will loom larger in Obama’s second-term agenda, especially as the ongoing US troop withdrawal ends the Afghanistan war by 2014.
But, at least since Keynes, we know how to stimulate the economy more effectively, and in ways that increase long-term productivity and enhance living standards.
But, much as the Bush administration tried to hide the true costs of the war by incomplete and misleading accounting, the economy’s flaws were covered up by a flood of liquidity from the Federal Reserve and by lax financial regulation.
China, for example, is worried that the Fed’s stimulus will increase its domestic inflation. 
The numbers are hard to believe.
But that view fails to comprehend that a weakened, corrupt, and abusive Central Asia is not in America’s interest, or in Afghanistan’s for that matter.
Though fragile and violent, Kyrgyzstan is the most democratic state in the region, and it could be America’s natural ally.
The aide then withered under the (Chinese) ambassador’s horrified stare.”
Though some hawks called for only muted criticism of the regime, the US had no choice but to condemn the massacre and be expelled.
As the American scholar and activist Hussein Ibish recently argued, Obama has appointed a cabinet designed to give him maximum room to negotiate a deal with Iran.
The US has thus painted itself into a corner.
Thus, the stakes for both the US and Iran are very high.
But, at the same time, his administration was holding approximately 400 prisoners at the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba.
He was then taken to an interrogation room where he saw a longhaired man with a full beard who was gagged with duct tape that “covered much of his head.”
If there are any human rights at all, the right not to be locked up indefinitely without trial is surely one of them.
Leaders of major US companies have decided that global man-made climate change is real, must be controlled, and that business must play a constructive part in the process.
Society will have to pay a price for these investments in new energy technologies, but the benefits will be vastly greater than the price.
So investors are telling companies to report their carbon emissions today in order to assess future liabilities.
The solutions will not be easy, and the effort must last over many decades in all parts of the world.
Old enemies became new allies, and together pioneered a new global economic system that made the world more prosperous.
Statecraft has yet to adapt.
So, too, in Asia, where President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping just announced ambitious commitments to tackle climate change, we are reminded of what countries can accomplish together with real leadership – and of how much additional leadership is required to conclude a successful climate agreement in Paris next year.
A good example is the international effort to confront the Islamic State’s malign brutality in Iraq and Syria.
For example, the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) reflect President Obama’s determination to strike an accord with countries that represent one-third of global trade and 40% of global GDP.
They do not have the same abilities as adults to protect or care for themselves.
None of this is because Americans do not care about their children.
Inevitably, in countries where children have inadequate nutrition, insufficient access to health care and education, and higher exposure to environmental hazards, the children of the poor will have far different life prospects from those of the rich.
Indeed, while inequality’s harmful effects are wide-reaching, and impose huge costs on our economies and societies, they are largely avoidable.
BERKELEY – On the back left corner of my desk right now are three recent books: Arthur Brooks’ The Battle, Charles Murray’s Coming Apart, and Nicholas Eberstadt’s A Nation of Takers.
Fast-forward 150 years to post-World War II America, and to the original Chicago School critique of the New Deal version of social insurance – that it created “notches” that perverted economic incentives.
The crucial point is that America’s conservative elites believe Brooks, Eberstadt, and Murray.
As for the Democrats, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's likely nomination (despite recent revelations that she used her personal email account to conduct government business) reinforces foreign policy's centrality to the election.
But, ironically, the notion of American exceptionalism often has led the US to undermine the international system that it nurtured.
US President Barack Obama's administration has tried to create the illusion of a change of course in this regard, pushing “soft" deals that allow the US to participate without submitting to binding rules.
American Foreign Policy after Iraq
But the new unilateralism was based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of power in world politics.
There is no simple military solution that will produce the outcomes we want.
Similarly, the threat of pandemics means that Americans may come to recognize the importance of a stronger World Health Organization, just as the problem of nuclear proliferation is increasing awareness of the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
It must be rooted in the indigenous society and bear its characteristics, not be imposed from abroad.
But the fact that foreign policy did not materially affect the November elections does not mean that the results will not affect US foreign policy.
There will be other consequences stemming from the election.
Questions abound when it comes to foreign economic policy, however.
America’s Global Balancing Act
The more serious problem with the “pivot to Asia” was its actual wording, which implied a military posture designed to “contain” or “isolate” China.
The Party elite, quite understandably, does not find this reassuring.
The fact of the matter is that the redistribution of global power has produced a situation in which the US is no longer the sole hegemon.
The Russian middle class, quite naturally, wishes to live in a society like that of Western Europe.
Like Samson in the temple of Gaza, he wishes to destroy himself in a public act of violence, taking as many people as possible with him.
The authorities’ overblown reaction – and that of much of the press – was all the odder for having occurred just as the US Senate was voting down a bill that would have made it harder for known killers and mentally disturbed people to buy guns, or for private individuals to acquire weapons normally used only in warfare.
The evil outside world should not be able to touch the Land of the Free.
Former President George W. Bush once explained terrorism as the expression of hatred for American freedom.
The British Empire was ruled in large part through reliance on local troops.
Still others consider hegemony to be synonymous with control of the most power resources.
Given this, the US position in the world could more accurately be called a “half-hegemony.”
In short, while the era of US primacy is not over, it is set to change in important ways.
It may well be true that Obama would rather exercise caution – even when bold action is called for – than act impulsively and potentially cause more damage.
Immediately after World War II, the memory of war, together with the enduring threat posed by the Soviet Union, made plain the importance of building and maintaining a liberal world order. Today, though the need for such an order is just as great, the argument is not nearly as comprehensible or emotionally powerful.
For the last three years, the consensus has been that the US economy was on the verge of a robust and self-sustaining recovery that would restore above-potential growth.
Of course, the drag will be much smaller, as tax increases and spending cuts will be much milder.
Indeed, the credit channel is frozen and velocity has collapsed, with banks hoarding increases in base money in the form of excess reserves.
America’s former adversaries either became preoccupied with consolidating or sharing power, suffered domestic defeat, or confronted neighboring states.
In February 1984, facing a quagmire, Reagan acceded to Vice President George H.W. Bush’s recommendation to get out of Lebanon.
Following Ethiopia’s intervention, the Islamists found themselves out of power.
This in turn stimulated China’s unsuccessful intervention in North Vietnam.
Perhaps most remarkable was the absence of reflexive Islamophobia and of the willingness to fight any war – even the wrong war in the wrong country for the wrong reasons – against the supposedly culpable “other.”
Immediately, the bombings began to be cited by some leaders as a call to limit constitutional rights.
Of course, reliance on fear and misdirection may still be part of official strategy.
Fortunately, most Americans have learned from the past, and this was reflected in the public response this time around – sadness, yes, but also some wisdom.
No number reveals the true catastrophe of the American financial system more than this one.
Underutilization of capacity, however, remains huge.
The US is considering the possibility of imposing a bequest tax on foreign holdings of US securities, and many people believe that it will try to play “the Italian card”: inflating away its public debt and devaluing the currency in order to maintain international competitiveness.
After its banking crisis of 1987-1989, Japan experienced two decades of stagnation and deflation with skyrocketing government debt.
A real-estate price crash has also been a key cause of emerging-market crises, such as the 1997-98 Asian collapse.
But banks can use internal mathematical models to calculate their own risk weights.
In 2012, the UK authorities asked banks to apply a temporary minimum 15% risk weight to their mortgage portfolios, though that guidance expired in July.
The views expressed in this column are the author’s own, and do not represent those of the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.
Given the fragile grip that these leaders have over their societies, America’s warnings have been taken to heart.
Bush still refuses to talk to either of them, and has lately been having US troops arrest Iranian agents in Iraq.
But Iran has resources that Cambodia and Laos could never muster; indeed, its ability to retaliate could set the entire region ablaze.
Pakistan is home to most remaining Afghan refugees, perhaps as many as 1.9 million.
Here one finds Tora Bora, the last known home address of Osama bin Laden.
Unfortunately, far too much discussion has centered on what governments can do to stimulate demand through budget deficits and monetary policy.
Moreover, even if it never had a financial crisis, Japan would have been plagued by adverse demographics, as its population is both aging and shrinking.
Supporters of the US administration might fairly argue that it is undertaking long-deferred maintenance on issues such as income inequality.
For better or for worse, productivity trends are very difficult to extrapolate, depending as they do on hugely complex interactions of social, economic, and political forces.
Throughout last autumn, they agonized over the rise of Spanish and Italian bond rates, until finally the European Central Bank decided to administer pain relief in the form of large-scale liquidity provision to banks.
One summit will not result in decisions that take months to prepare.
To use the partner countries’ taxpayers’ money to rescue Spanish banks is neither economically justified nor politically acceptable.
Europe’s leaders cannot decide anything at this stage, but they should task a group of “wise men” (and women) to evaluate and report on options by summer’s end.
France wants financial solidarity without closer political integration.
Yet, despite this good news, the continent’s politics have turned upside down, calling into question whether economic success can be sustained.
The current crop of left-wing political leaders is different from the populist “
The vast majority of Latin America countries do not fulfill any of these requirements.
Co-sponsored by Spain and Turkey, the Alliance of Civilizations initiative is not devoid of political calculation.
To claim that Islam is incompatible with human rights is to consider it a civilization too hidebound to change.
Of course, the Alliance of Civilizations should not attempt to bridge differences by defending moral relativism.
PARIS – During NATO’s recent 60th anniversary ceremony in Strasbourg, the Alliance welcomed two new members, Albania and Croatia, bringing its total membership to 28.
At the time, no one ever doubted that American power – already endowed with nuclear weapons – was the only counterpart.
This inability to discuss, clearly and forthrightly, this strategic doctrine continues to hamper the Alliance.
On the contrary, the Allies chose to maintain the pact and to extend it to numerous Russian neighbors.
CAMBRIDGE – The United States may be headed for a recession in 2013.
He could have said the same thing about the fiscal drag that would be created by Obama’s budget proposal.
Over a decade, that implies nearly $2 trillion in additional revenue without any increase in tax rates from today’s levels.
SINGAPORE – When accidents happen, there is always enough blame to go around, and with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, no one has been spared – with the exception of one of the main culprits, the American public.
For example, while Americans could have supported more aggressive fuel-economy standards or increased federal taxes on energy, they didn’t.
In terms of total lifecycle costs, these vehicles are three to six times more energy-efficient than their petroleum counterparts.
These seemingly mutually exclusive alternatives have one thing in common: neither of them has been thought through to the end.
Economically, it mainly relies on energy and commodity exports, and in its modernization efforts, it is largely dependent on the West, particularly Europe.
But this applies similarly, if in reverse, to the West: on the one hand, the principles of a new Europe as defined by the OSCE after 1989/1990 don’t allow decisions about alliances to be subject to the veto of a large neighbor.
If the West approaches these discussions with Russia without illusions, with a clear understanding of its own strategic interests, and with new ideas for partnership and cooperation, the worst to be feared is failure.
But the best analogy for Tunisia today is Spain in the years preceding and following the death of Francisco Franco.
They, too, thirst for freedom.
Turkey is demonstrating that Islam and modernity are compatible.
But this would lead to an even greater tragedy.
The more Iranians visit China and India, the more likely that Iran will change.
We have great differences today.
Iranian students should be encouraged to visit and study in Asian universities, where they would discover how confident young Chinese and Indian students are about the future − which might well cause them to reflect on why young Iranians do not share that optimism.
No one can predict the direction in which Egypt’s Sunni Islamist president and parliamentary majority will lead the country.
Would such intervention revive Lebanon’s own long civil war of the 1970’s and 1980’s?
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak cannot accept a nuclear-armed Iran.
A war in the Persian Gulf – still the world’s gas station – would affect oil exports for some time, and energy prices would skyrocket, dealing a severe blow to a global economy that is teetering on the brink of recession.
Has the quake given birth to some new, positive political force that will accelerate reform?
After all, they don’t want someone controlling them who is both able and serious.
Bureaucrats must not be allowed to spend the huge donations collected and state relief funds allotted in an arbitrary manner.
A more open and transparent public environment will help awaken their sense of political mission.
In the four years since the global financial crisis struck, the growth rate fell to -1.2%, compared to the eurozone average of -0.2%, and it is expected to remain negative this year.
Likewise, labor-market reform, improved education, and enhanced human capital could contribute an additional 4% to GDP growth in the next decade.
Furthermore, attracting more direct investment is crucial, given that capital inflows, while recovering, remain 30% below their pre-crisis level; with outflows exceeding inflows, Italy has become a net capital exporter.
And the tax burden, which has exceeded 40% of GDP since 1990, now stands at almost 43% of GDP.
Now, because of a war it wanted no part of, Europe finds its security undermined.
Europeans might be forgiven for thinking that the Americans, who pumped up oil prices in the first place with their military misadventure in Iraq, should be the ones who “pump it down” with an energy tax.
Critics who worry about the cost of the energy tax have not thought about tax substitutions.
Solemn promises made over the years would have to be broken (people would not get the social services that they paid for with a lifetime of high taxes), lives would be shortened (less money for hospitals and nursing homes), and overall hardship increased.
CAMBRIDGE – What a difference the crisis has made for the International Monetary Fund.
It ardently championed global fiscal stimulus on the order of 2% of world GNP – a position that is all the more remarkable in view of its traditional conservatism on all fiscal matters.
That is what happened in the second half of the 1990’s, as the IMF began to preach capital-account liberalization, applied over-stringent fiscal remedies during the Asian financial crisis, and single-handedly tried to reshape Asian economies.
One option would be to increase substantially the number of mid-career recruits with actual practical experience in developing countries.
NEW YORK – Afghanistan’s security and political situation remains plagued by uncertainty, stemming from the withdrawal of United States and NATO combat troops, the upcoming presidential election, and the stalled peace negotiations with the Taliban.
Moreover, in the effort to develop two of the world’s largest mines, investors’ greed prevailed over their security and business-climate concerns.
Indeed, a drastic shift in policy is essential to avoid economic collapse.
An Inconvenient Peace Prize
Gore also frets about the future of polar bears.
Climate change is not the only problem facing the globe.
While we worry about the far-off effects of climate change, we do nothing to deal with issues facing the planet today.
However, the contrast between this year’s Nobel winners could not be sharper. The IPCC engages in meticulous research where facts rule over everything else.
Musharraf did head that way a few months later, when he forced an invitation out of Singh to watch a cricket match between the two sides in New Delhi in 2005.
He and Singh also found time during the game to talk about bilateral relations, and agreed to launch what came to be called the “composite dialogue,” covering eight contentious issues that had soured ties for so long.
Gilani expressed the same sentiment: “We need to focus on dealing with our common enemies – inflation, poverty, hunger, disease, and unemployment – for the prosperity of the two countries.”
It is clear that for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government, the start of indirect talks without freezing settlement activities in the West Bank and Jerusalem is a sort of victory.
Jerusalem will be much more difficult to demarcate. Palestinians and Israelis have publicly said that they do not want a wall separating West and East Jerusalem.
For many Palestinians and Israelis, as well as for the international community, the shape and details of what would be a settlement acceptable to majorities on both sides is well known.
Over the two last decades, masses of Indians and Chinese have closed the gap (in relative terms) with the rich world.
Thus, even if the absolute income gap between an average American and an average African increases, why worry? After all, such people argue, the average African would be a bit less poor.
This is why international action to address both global poverty and global inequality is needed.
But they cannot fail to notice that the processes they support undercut their own position by rendering the wealth gap more obvious and the fairness of the actual global distribution more questionable.
Indeed, except for deflation-ridden Japan, central bankers could meet just about anywhere and see high and rising inflation.
America’s inflation would be contained but for the fact that so many countries, from the Middle East to Asia, effectively tie their currencies to the dollar.
But inflation pressures will be even worse if the US recession remains mild and global growth remains solid.
Many arrests and disruptions of terrorist operations in Europe result from cooperation between EU members' intelligence services.
I see another role for intelligence: to inform political action. Intelligence services can educate the public, explaining the origins of the alienation that underpins terrorism, how radicalization and recruitment occur, and highlight terrorists' goals, methods, and targeting strategies.
We are better targeting our external assistance and capacity building programs, and we are ready to use our trade and economic muscle, when necessary, by demanding counter-terrorism clauses in bilateral treaties.
As requested by the European Council, I am developing, in cooperation with the European Commission, a strategy to shut down terrorist financing.
There is entirely too much fuel for terrorist propaganda.
Not only could it happen here, Indians say, it already has.
The current Congress Party-led government of Manmohan Singh comprises 20 parties; it succeeded a 23-party coalition headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
The daughter of a government clerk, Mayawati studied law and worked as a teacher before being spotted by the BSP’s founder, the late Kanshi Ram, and groomed for political leadership. Her ascent has been marked by a heavy emphasis on symbolism – her rule in Uttar Pradesh has featured the construction of numerous statues of Dalit leaders, notably herself – and a taste for lavish celebrations.
Experts would remind us that Kazakhstan had never been a country, and that Ukrainian claims to independence are historically dubious.
This is not a novel phenomenon.
Indeed, though the UNPO, to which both belong – alongside Assyria and the Buffalo River Dene Nation – has a vaguely Marx Brothers’ air to it (one expects Freedonia, the mythical country of which Groucho Marx was prime minister, to be on the roster), six member states already have left it to join the UN, and Kosovo, now independent if lacking UN recognition, will eventually follow.
I believe that the chances for a political breakthrough in our region have never been better.
Direct talks should concentrate on two parallel tracks.
I truly wish you success in your responsibilities as acting Prime Minister and acting head of Kadima.
In recent months, Obama has stepped up his own involvement and that of senior figures in his administration in support of a peace strategy for Sudan.
The current moment requires robust diplomacy – the kind that can leave a bad taste in your mouth, but that gets the job done.
The US role as the invisible third party to the agreement involves a series of incentives offered to the regime in Khartoum to ensure agreement and implementation of a peace deal.
Keep the pressure on them. Support the peace process.
Yet the euphoric reaction seen in some quarters is misplaced.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Arak plant still lacks several major reactor components, such as control-room equipment and cooling pumps.
This view of nuclear weapons as a shorthand for national greatness is reinforced by the architecture of the non-proliferation regime, which firmly divides states into two camps: nuclear haves and have-nots.
Insecure Europe
The ESS’s emphasis on soft power is also in urgent need of reassessment.
MADRID – The recriminations over US spying activities, triggered by the revelations of the former American intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden, have now reached fever pitch.
What followed was a decade of scattershot foreign policy marked by notable cases of inaction, together with individual initiatives taken largely without reference to a broader doctrine.
It cannot solve problems that directly affect it by acting on its own, though its leadership remains indispensable.
What is really needed is a change in vision and mentality – a shift from viewing multilateralism as a tactic to embracing it as a strategic imperative.
One such trend is Europeans’ growing skepticism toward integration, exemplified in May’s European Parliament election.
Though complaints about the “bloated” acquis communitaire (the body of EU law) are often unfounded, the EU legislative process is not without its shortcomings, as recent attempts at harmonization clearly demonstrate.
The lack of progress on this front during the last two Commissions was rooted mainly in Germany’s Russian modernization project, which has shaped its approach to energy security.
MADRID – Among this summer’s grave global worries, the spread of the Ebola virus has monopolized the discussion of Sub-Saharan Africa and reinvigorated hoary notions of disorder and despair – at a time when a new image of a dynamic Africa was emerging.
Meanwhile, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the Bank’s provider of political risk insurance covering investments in developing countries, has moved to expand its activities, both by broadening the types of projects that it supports and widening existing definitions to allow greater coverage.
Finally, the high profile of the US-Africa Leaders Summit, with more than 40 heads of state in attendance, as well as President Barack Obama’s direct involvement, generated buzz about Africa.
In recent years, Africa, once a land of pity, has emerged as a land of opportunity.
The key to success is the background against which the process plays out.
Furthermore, Iran’s negotiating style, like its capital city, can be both fatiguing and confusing.
For Iran, a staunch supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, a weaker US-Saudi relationship is key to shifting the regional balance of power – especially if it is accompanied by the easing of Western economic sanctions.
Today, Europe will be critical to driving progress, particularly in the event that the US Congress torpedoes a sensible agreement.
In both cases, he was met with skepticism and apathy.
But a year ago, the figures were already dire: 60,000 dead, 700,000 international refugees, and two million internally displaced. If there were a threshold of misery that would cause the world to say, “Enough is enough,” it surely would have been crossed by now.
Consider Obama’s call, backed by no action, for Assad to “step aside,” and his repeated promises, dating to early 2012, to provide non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition – promises that were finally fulfilled late last year, and then only temporarily.
But, like their leaders, publics everywhere have been reticent to act.
Though not one to deny the existence of such base motives, I would insist that the crisis has its roots in key policy decisions stretching back over decades. 
It is important to note that these were unintended consequences of basically sensible policy decisions.
As a stand-alone entity, it was then vulnerable to market swings.
It also created a more buoyant market for the securities of Freddie and Fannie, feeding the originate-and-distribute machine.
US households will have to start saving again.
Unintended consequences cannot always be prevented.
Moreover, commercial real estate is beginning to follow the downward trend in residential real estate.
During a typical recession, the default rate among corporations may rise to 10-15%, threatening massive losses for those holding risky corporate bonds.
The ensuing losses will aggravate the financial turmoil and economic contraction.
The percentage of those who “strongly agree” that democracy is the best form of government increased from 20% to 31%.
The presidency of Mohammad Khatami, an avowed reformer, who served eight years, beginning in 1997, convinced the Supreme Leader that his authority would be assured only if the presidency was held by a subservient fundamentalist such as the current president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
These concerns were reflected in the fact that the Society of Combatant Clergy, a conservative body, was unable to endorse Ahmadinejad’s candidacy.
For now, what will happen depends on Mousavi’s perseverance.
In that two year period, Chavez stepped on the gas for his social reforms – education, health care, etc. – and also in regard to breaking down the country’s excessive concentrations of wealth.
Moreover, growth under Chavez seems to reflect an increase in domestic consumption resulting from the flow of petrodollars and nothing more fundamental, as oil remains the economy’s only real engine.
But history never truly repeats itself.
It is held culpable for the near financial meltdown.
Nevertheless, by the 1970’s the pre-Thatcher political economy was in crisis.
What about inflation targeting? Here, too, the record since 1980 has been patchy, despite the huge deflationary pressure exerted by low-wage competition from Asia.
Thatcherism’s second success was to weaken trade unions.
NEW DELHI – For 18 days, during the ebb and flow of protest, it did not seem possible that the end of the Egyptian Revolution would come so suddenly, in a terse announcement that lasted no more than a half-minute: “President Hosni Mubarak has relinquished office….”
Decades-old, apparently immovable autocracies are finding their hold on power unhinged; change is invading their static environs.
They – and we – are very far from the world that Mubarak, or the great Gamal Abdel Nasser, knew and understood.
But it is not only the fate of Israel that has now shocked US policy, in particular, to its core.
WASHINGTON – The European Union’s most important decision this fall will be whether to sign an Association Agreement with Ukraine at the EU summit in Vilnius on November 28-29.
Membership would require Ukraine to double import tariffs on EU goods, at an annual cost equivalent to 4% of GDP; and it would not even guarantee free trade among its members (Russia already applies trade sanctions against Belarus and Kazakhstan).
Many are fed up with the arbitrary imposition of trade barriers – affecting goods ranging from chocolate to steel pipes – in their former Soviet markets.
Tymoshenko has accepted the deal; Yanukovych has not.
The European Council of Ministers will make its final decision on November 18.
The fallout from nuclear waste is one; humans’ contribution to global warming through greenhouse-gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, and its impact on rising sea levels, is another.
This risk is no longer merely theoretical.
That means deciding – sooner rather than later – which path to follow.
Today, it is a matter of common sense.
More sophisticated examples can involve systems for health and safety inspection, product-quality certification, or intellectual-property protection.
Consider the tourism industry, which has great potential in the beautiful Patagonia region of southern Argentina and Chile.
To be sure, those problems had to be corrected.
Latin America will need a great deal of fresh thinking and many policy innovations if it is to keep growing in a post-commodity-boom era.
No more.
In Bolivia, President Evo Morales has resorted to legal and constitutional shenanigans to guarantee himself yet another term in office. After two terms, Morales would in theory be prohibited from running again.
Political complications linked to a possible meeting with the Venezuelan opposition, which Bachelet had chosen not to attend (preferring to send her foreign minister), likely also played a part.
Leaders from Sweden and New Zealand argued that you could make the state both leaner and more effective.
Manuel Valls, France’s Socialist prime minister, is staking his political capital on an ambitious program of tax and spending cuts that does not enjoy the backing of his party’s traditionalist wing.
The other reason for giving Third Way ideas a second hearing is that they work.
But it is remarkable in the case of socialist Marina Silva, who is calling for new trade pacts beyond Mercosur and for making the Central Bank of Brazil independent.
Instead of simply providing handouts, governments should strive to guarantee good jobs at good wages.
Environmental degradation is on the rise.
No governance framework is in place for emerging high-seas industries such as energy production.
The increasing uptake of carbon dioxide is causing ocean acidification and unprecedented changes in chemical and physical conditions, which in turn are affecting marine organisms and ecosystems.
Without subsidies, high-seas fisheries would not be financially viable.

Last week, addressing a gilded ballroom packed with the elite of Argentina’s business community, Kicillof explained the government’s policies as a real-world application of Keynesian theories.
The fiscal and monetary impulse supported a rapid recovery.
But Argentines are not pessimistic about the economy because other Argentines are pessimistic.
But Keynes is not to blame. Kicillof and Kirchner are.
Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and China, there are calls for extending university programs so that students can obtain a broad, liberal education, in the hope that graduates will be more inclined to experiment and innovate.
·         How should we balance individual liberty and collective security?
Similar efforts have been underway for years in the US.
HONG KONG – It is now widely accepted that the recent global financial crisis was actually a balance-sheet crisis.
But, given that the largest enterprises are either state-owned or local-government entities, their debts are essentially domestic sovereign obligations.
In other words, interest-rate reforms must be pursued alongside capital-market reforms that boost access to credit by the more productive sectors.
From a policy perspective, the goal should be to strike a balance between competition (which spurs growth-enhancing innovation but can also generate instability) and cooperation (which promotes long-term social cohesion but can also lead to stagnation).
E-commerce platforms like Alibaba have not only breached banks’ payment business; they have also begun to offer wealth-management products.
Given the difficulty of identifying which of the old rules needed to be reformed or eliminated, the process depended on the delegation of central-government powers to local governments, which were better equipped to experiment with market rules to boost economic growth.
But it is not enough.
Consider the effort last summer to assess the government’s financial condition.
With its latest set of reforms, China’s government is attempting finally to fine-tune its approach.
Great Cities and Ghost Towns
Of course, the translation of infrastructure investment into economic progress is not guaranteed.
By working with the World Bank and the China Development Bank (CDB), Shanghai and Guangdong created an innovative institutional structure to facilitate the coordination of stakeholders to deliver specific infrastructure projects, employing the legal and accounting tools of modern corporations.
But the infrastructure boom was underpinned by the belief that local governments would always have access to easy credit, cheap land, and rising demand.
HONG KONG – The eighteenth-century German military strategist Carl von Clausewitz defined war as the continuation of politics by different means, and, like the ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu, believed that securing peace meant preparing for violent conflict.
The second factor – clan – is manifested in rising ethnic tensions in Europe, Turkey, India, and elsewhere, driven by forces like migration and competition for jobs.
If emerging conflicts and competitive pressures lead to, say, economic sanctions or the obstruction of key trade routes, the resulting balkanization of global trade would diminish globalization’s benefits substantially.
With this approach, the US and its allies are sending a clear message to anyone who may disagree with US policy: avoid using the dollar and dollar-denominated bank accounts.
On one hand, consumers and investors are pushing businesses to raise their standards. On the other hand, technological shifts are generating more and better information faster, enabling unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability.
Traceability of certain key commodities – including palm oil, soy, and paper pulp – will determine the success of the overall anti-deforestation agenda.
Global connectivity, through laptops and smart phones, means that people everywhere can get real-time information in their living rooms, board rooms, and in the palm of their hands.
New satellites currently being tested will gather images at even higher resolution.
WASHINGTON, DC – Coal is emerging as a major topic of conversation at the United Nations climate-change negotiations currently taking place in Warsaw – and rightly so.
Five Nordic countries have joined the US Treasury in ending public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, and others may soon follow suit.
If built, the world would commit a large share of the remaining carbon budget to high-carbon infrastructure with a lifespan of 40-50 years.
We need to expand access to these technologies rapidly, while helping people whose livelihoods depend on the coal industry.
PISA brings together policymakers, educators, and researchers from around the world to discuss what knowledge students need to become successful and responsible citizens in today’s world, and how to develop more effective, inclusive education systems.
Education systems as diverse as those in Finland, Japan, China, and Canada – which seldom registered on policymakers’ radars before – have become global reference points for excellence in education, helping other countries to design effective reforms.
This experience offers yet another lesson: even in cases where social and cultural factors seem to be the main force shaping a country’s education style, improvements are possible.
BERLIN – The European Union’s recent summit has brought about a typically European compromise on the Greek financial crisis, one that avoids the term “solution” and hides behind the idea of a “mechanism.”
Everyone involved could have lived with this compromise; it was the political confrontation that preceded it that made agreement difficult. Indeed, the European confrontation Merkel initiated (shame on you if you see a connection with the upcoming German elections) has changed the EU forever.
If Germany no longer Europeanizes its more narrowly defined national interests, but pursues them as others do, the result will be a re-nationalization within the EU.
PARIS – The recent cover of Der Spiegel showing German Chancellor Angela Merkel in front of the Acropolis surrounded by Nazi officers serves an important purpose: it finally poses, in a way that cannot be evaded, the question of Germanophobia in Europe.
From the extreme right, National Front leader Marine Le Pen chides Merkel for the “suffering” that she is imposing on the peoples of Europe.
It should also be noted that Merkel is a woman, and that hatred for women – the disdain in which they, right alongside the Jews, were regarded by the racist theoreticians of the 1920s and 1930s – has been an essential dimension of every expression of fascism.
Angela Merkel Meets the World
When he established a close personal and political relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he signaled to the world – and to the EU’s sensitive new Eastern European members – that Germany’s foreign policy would no longer be constrained by the past.
But she has already made clear that Germany’s neighbors to the East will have no reason not feel bypassed.
At home, Merkel can hope to reap the rewards.
Germany’s actions throughout the crisis have been plainly contradictory.
Her style of leadership, which has mostly consisted of taking a wait-and-see approach to issues, fits this uncertainty well.
Merkel now feels the fatal consequences of her “leadership without leading” approach.
So, as Germans once again see their “Iron Chancellor” deliver butter-soft results, they are increasingly likely to trust those who warn that the government is being tricked into a “transfer union” that uses German money to finance handouts for fiscally lax EU members.
And, two weeks before Martin died, Jolie revealed that she had undergone a preventive double mastectomy after testing positive for a BRCA gene mutation – which is correlated with a woman’s being five times more susceptible to breast cancer and 28 times more susceptible to ovarian cancer.
As enthusiastically as the global mass media has received her choice, it is nonetheless extremely difficult in the West for a woman to be portrayed as maternal – let alone physically “flawed” or “impaired” – and also as a fantasy sex object.
Twenty-two years ago, when Anita Hill publicly accused then-US Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, it was she, the alleged victim, who was scrutinized and smeared as “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty.”
When they couldn’t pay, as sometimes happened, sovereigns defaulted.
When debt is unsustainable, there are several possible negotiating outcomes. Sometimes, debt-service payments are rescheduled and perhaps stretched out over a longer period, thus giving the debtor country time to regain its ability to pay.
Regardless of how the current impasse is resolved, the ruling raises many questions for issuers and holders of sovereign debt. If creditors now believe that holding out makes it more likely that they will receive full value at a later date, restructuring sovereign debt and restoring a debtor economy’s normal functioning will be more difficult.
In fact, these ceremonies are about the graduates’ families – that is, those who have loved and supported them, regardless of their biological connection – as much as they are about the graduates themselves.
To this end, they should ask their own fathers and grandfathers what they wish they had done differently – and plan accordingly.
The point is the choice: the choice of how much energy to devote to one’s home, the choice of a career based on passion, and the choice of a genuinely equal partner.
Finally, graduation does not mean that the family’s job is complete.
In return, Iran will get “limited, temporary, targeted, and reversible relief” from international sanctions.
That includes suspension of international sanctions on Iran’s exports of oil, gold, and cars, which could yield $1.5 billion in revenue; unfreezing $4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales; and releasing tuition-assistance payments from the Iranian government to Iranian students enrolled abroad.
Let us imagine, just for a moment, what the Middle East and Central Asia could look like if the US and Iran could once again talk to each other.
That is what it takes.
He knows that a US-led military effort can significantly weaken the Islamic State, but that only a combined military-political effort can defeat it.
Where Obama’s strategy is weakest is in reaching ordinary people: the networked web of human relationships that transmits rage, hatred, and despair or hope, trust, and loyalty.
For, contrary to Obama’s claim, the brutality of the Islamic State is not “unique.”
Check.
Honoring all three of those legal obligations simultaneously is impossible if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling, but raising the debt ceiling without Congressional approval, though illegal and an impeachable offense, was the least-bad choice.
Equally important, these women felt – and acted upon – the moral necessity of actually governing. In the words of Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who first put together the outlines of a deal and took it to the Senate floor, the shutdown “hurt all the small businesses” around Acadia National Park in her home state, “and that is plain wrong.”
Several weeks ago, German President Joachim Gauck’s opening address to the 50th annual Munich Security Conference reflected on the Federal Republic’s evolution over those five decades, a period that gave rise to “a good Germany, the best we have ever known.”
Germany has long sought a seat on the United Nations Security Council, making common cause with Japan, Brazil, and India.
More controversially, Gauck proclaimed the need for Security Council authorization of any use of force, but also hinted at a Kosovo precedent for possible military intervention in Syria.
That means supporting a greater global role for all powers that understand and accept real responsibility for maintaining global peace and security.
The task now for would-be peace brokers is to halt that dynamic by agreeing on criteria for participation in whatever elections will eventually be held, regardless of whether President Bashar al-Assad remains in power until then.
Finally, the single most important step that US President Barack Obama could take is to put the credible threat of force back on the table.
The threat of cruise-missile strikes last September was enough to send Al Qaeda members in Syria scrambling for the hills.
But this time something was different: Americans continued to watch even after the US team was eliminated.
For starters, both the US team and the US audience for soccer derive their growing strength from immigrants – many from countries where the sport is a national passion.
My mother is originally Belgian, though she has been a US citizen for over 50 years; I still have an uncle, aunt, and cousins in Brussels.

The Shareholder Spring Continues
Discontent has continued to mount, and investors, employees, politicians, and members of the public now want to know not only about executive compensation, but also about the frequently staggering discrepancy between what companies’ highest- and lowest-paid personnel earn.
In contrast, other companies have swung to the opposite extreme and embraced fully virtual meetings.
On top of Argentina’s bestseller list is The Myths of Argentine History, Volume Two .
In the collective imagination, this idea was expressed in the phrase, “The country that we all deserve.”
Argentina has become a country without direction.
The process of developing and coming to terms with a new national idea cannot begin and end with a rejection of the very concept.
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo’s independence, because nationalism remains the dominant political force in the country.
The nature of the independence bestowed is also important.
And they continue to push &#45;&#45; unsuccessfully &#45;&#45; for Ahtisaari’s removal in order to prolong the Vienna talks.
But failure to proceed definitively now on Kosovo’s final status will produce a worse Balkan situation, one that blocks Serbia’s move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU, condemns Kosovo’s ethnic minorities to dangerous ambiguity, and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia.
By the 1970’s, it had brought to the United Kingdom large and ultimately unsustainable current-account deficits, high levels of inflation, and then political gridlock over what to do.
There appears to be an overwhelming likelihood that the 1974 stalemate will be repeated in the upcoming general election on May 6.
The magic of markets made possible an individualization of borrowing and consumption.
The moment they start to disagree with the Liberal Democrats, they will make themselves look extreme and will forfeit voter sympathies.
The latter option, once unthinkable, is possible because Berlusconi is not running the type of inflammatory electoral campaign that he has in the past.
New activism on the part of France and the United Kingdom, along with Germany’s emergence as a central player in EU affairs, risk marginalizing Italy’s influence even more.
Strong pan-European center-right and center-left political parties are likely to contest the European Parliament elections in the spring of 2009.
Even the once famously tolerant Dutch and Danes are increasingly voting for parties that fulminate against the scourge of immigration.
On the right, support for conservative parties is split between business interests that benefit from immigration or supranational institutions, and groups that feel threatened by them.
It is irrelevant that the provincials’ political leaders (and their backers) are sometimes wealthier than the resented metropolitan elites.
Likewise, economic globalization cannot be undone.
By a vote of eight to three, the Court upheld his conviction on charges of racism.
They bar threats against, and harassment of, individuals.
Constitutional and legal provisions that make practicing racism a crime punishable by imprisonment have great symbolic significance and help insure - indeed, create and secure - social peace.
Ellwanger crossed the line separating free expression from hate speech.
Likewise, “Eurabia,” Bat Ye’Or’s prophecy of Islamic doom for the West, simply is not emerging.
None of these events sparked anything remotely resembling the public outrage of recent weeks.
As Hannah Arendt pointed out six decades ago, the rise of anti-Semitism fueled Europe’s descent into totalitarianism.
LONDON – This week, British Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a new fund to support research aimed at tackling the problem of so-called superbugs: disease-causing microbes that have become resistant to conventional drugs.
As it stands, huge amounts of antibiotics are wasted each year – even in countries with highly sophisticated health-care systems.
Real progress over the next five years requires these countries’ health-care systems to leapfrog ahead of those of the advanced economies, by implementing rapid diagnostic technologies and tools wherever possible, thereby ensuring that antibiotics are used only when truly necessary.
This system would not only spur innovation; it would also help to increase uptake of new and existing diagnostics.
दवा-रोधी रोगाणुओं की चुनौती का सामना करना कठिन होगा।  इसके लिए न केवल नई रोगाणु-रोधी दवाओं के अनुसंधान और विकास में प्रमुख निवेश की ज़रूरत होगी, बल्कि नए इलाजों को नियंत्रित और सीमित करने की ज़रूरत भी होगी, ताकि उनकी प्रभावकारिता संरक्षित रखी जा सके। जैसा कि जलवायु परिवर्तन पर प्रतिक्रिया के साथ है, प्रभावी रणनीति के लिए अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समन्वय की ज़रूरत होगी। ख़ास तौर से, सरकारी भुगतानकर्ताओं और वैश्विक ग़रीबों के साथ फ़ार्मास्यूटिकल कंपनियों की ज़रूरतों का समाधान किया जाना चाहिए।


“We agree that attention should be given to global health risks, such as antimicrobial resistance, infectious disease threats, and weak health systems,” read the communiqué. “These can significantly impact growth and stability.”
And we are improving the surveillance of superbugs, as we learn more about the dangers they pose to humans and animals. The United Kingdom, for example, has committed $300 million to support microbiology surveillance capacity in developing countries.
दवा का सामाजिक विज्ञान

समस्या का प्रभावी ढंग से समाधान करने के लिए, इस प्रयास को जैविक विज्ञान के दायरे से आगे बढ़ाकर दवा के साथ पारंपरिक रूप से न जुड़े क्षेत्रों तक ले जाना चाहिए। अमीर और गरीब देशों दोनों में ही समान रूप से, हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के नियमित नशेड़ी बन गए हैं। प्रतिरोध का मुकाबला करने की कुंजी यह है कि रोगजनक जिस गति से अनुकूलन कर सकते हैं उस गति को कम किया जाए। लेकिन, एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के अधिक उपयोग और उपचार के लिए आवश्यक कोर्स को पूरा न करने के फलस्वरूप, हम रोगाणुओं का उपयोग अभी पर्याप्त दवा प्रतिरोध को प्रोत्साहित करने के लिए कर रहे हैं। वास्तव में, हम रोगाणुओं का टीका लगाकर हम उनके खिलाफ जो प्रयोग करना चाहते हैं उसे दवाओं के खिलाफ कर रहे हैं।

It is the epicenter of underlying tensions stemming from China’s rise and its impact on the United States, the region’s established power since World War II’s end.
Furthermore, Chinese leaders point to what they regards as intrusive US human-rights diplomacy aimed at fomenting political protest within China (including Hong Kong) and undermining the regime’s domestic legitimacy.
Such a framework embraces realism about areas of contention defined by significant conflicting national interests and values.
APEC, an Australian diplomatic initiative launched 25 years ago, was originally conceived as an exclusively economic forum.
A meeting between Abe and Xi – their first since either came to power – would offer concrete grounds for hope.
With both leaders having spent the last two years overcoming domestic opponents and consolidating their power, they may have gained confidence in their ability to compromise.
How Abe decides is likely to depend on his confidence in his political position.
When it didn’t, either the official representatives left in protest at our presence, or we left hurriedly, or we all pretended not to notice each other, or – albeit on rare occasions – we started to converse with each other, which frequently were the only moments of dialogue between the regime and the opposition (not counting our courthouse encounters).
It will be even worse if the EU countries try to mask their screening activities by inviting only diplomats to embassy celebrations in Cuba.
Where will it end?
This month has been a bad one for the cause of human rights in Europe, as Serbia was allowed to begin its six-month presidency of the Council of Europe, the Continent’s oldest political body.
But an immediate resumption of negotiations amounts to an approach that is all carrot and no stick, damaging the EU’s own credibility.
Mladic must be arrested before talks start, not after.
We know how that plan ended.
But now, following the North’s recent nuclear tests, and given its improving ballistic-missile capabilities, that approach is no longer tenable.
I still recall the difficulty that I faced, as South Korea’s foreign minister, in convincing Bush administration policymakers to negotiate with North Korea instead of merely applying pressure and waiting for the North to capitulate.
China fears not only the social and economic consequences of a North Korean implosion, but also the strategic consequences of reunification – in particular, that the US military, through its alliance with South Korea, would gain access to territory on its border.
The lives of ordinary North Koreans matter as much as the security of North Korea’s neighbors.

Education efforts that are accessible and interesting have the potential to undermine that advantage.
Finally, apps can be undermined by the coercion that often accompanies human trafficking.
The gradual replacement of one generation of elites by another may be one of the key factors in determining whether or not effective reform takes place in the Arab world.
Unsurprisingly, many in this generation grew dissatisfied, and not a few began to look for Islamic alternatives to the prevailing political systems.
But it is the fourth group that underscores the relevance of generational issues in the Arab world.
Developments in Morocco, Bahrain, and Jordan certainly seem to suggest that this changing of the guard can help soften rigid political structures and allow for broader participation.
Arguably, it is a choice for economic modernization, for an end to the politics of conflict, and for positive political change further down the road.
Not unlike North Korea’s and Iran’s defiant nuclear policies, Bashar’s membership in the region’s “axis of evil” is a call for dialogue with America, not an invitation to an invasion, and for a settlement with Israel, not a drive to wage war on it.  
But, with the decline of secular nationalism and Islamism’s rise, the hidden electoral power of the Muslim Brotherhood poses a mortal threat to the regime and its strategic alliance with the West.
Rather, it means opting for a controlled transition to a post-revolutionary phase in which economic modernization and international integration might usher in greater political change in the future.
Governments don’t have the luxury of waiting forever, and they can no longer use the myth of popular quiescence to avoid initiating the necessary reforms that will address the public’s underlying grievances.
The protests are clearly the result of ordinary citizens becoming fed up with corruption, the lack of any semblance of rule of law, and arbitrary treatment.
But the subsequent silence on democratization aggravated – though it certainly did not cause – the unraveling of the Arab reform process in the last few years.
(Ten weeks into the fighting in Libya, the Europeans were already running out of munitions.)
But the fiscal crisis is not the whole story.
Conspicuously, there is much in the Narrative that coincides with Europe’s emphasis on soft power.
History gave Yasir Arafat far more time than most leaders to achieve his mission.
But this is the view of only a small minority of leaders, notably former Prime Minister Abu Mazin and Muhammad Dahlan, who heads his own militia in the Gaza Strip.
The problem for Palestinian moderates is clear: any leader willing to agree a peace treaty with Israel would be opposed - passionately and even violently - by roughly 80% of the movement.
Only if the post-Arafat movement decides that it really wants a Palestinian state in exchange for ending the conflict with Israel in every respect will there be a real chance of peace.
It has been correctly said over and again that Arafat was a mixed blessing for his people.
Whether or not he was solely to blame, a true opportunity for historical compromise was missed at Camp David in August 2000, and he himself acknowledged it a year later.
Statements by Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, Kofi Annan and others on the occasion of Arafat’s death have been forceful in demanding a speedy and long overdue resolution of the conflict.
Since April, we have spoken with Russian officials and academics, as well as officials from several other Arctic Council member states.
All countries – and Russia in particular – have infrastructure deficiencies in the Arctic; and, even with the sea ice melting, shipping remains risky and uncertain.
It will take years to sort out the competing claims under the treaty, but so far all of the concerned states are playing by the rules.
The Swedish bank cleanup in the early 1990’s is often cited as an example of how successful this idea can be.
The rest of Nordbanken, now known as Nordea, proceeded to become the largest bank in Scandinavia.
The new government implemented an effective and very big program to close a budget deficit of roughly 12% of GDP.
All subsidies should be transparent, and public/private bad banks are not.
They are trying to cook up ways to discipline financial firms, albeit without conspicuous success so far, as demonstrated by the large sums stashed away for employee compensation by Goldman Sachs after its most recent profitable quarter.
So there is some basis for saying they are overpaid, but why?
If this explanation is broadly correct (and it incorporates the deregulation point as well, as you can see) then what can be done about it? Politicians and regulators are exploring a number of options, from higher tax rates, through fines for certain types of bonus arrangements, to variable capital requirements.
What Good Are Economists?
Nonetheless, whenever a crisis loomed in the last century, the broad consensus among economists was that it did not.
But this criticism is unfair.
The fun thing about Litan’s book is that he details many clever little ideas about how to run businesses or to manage the economy better.
FDI can bring a range of benefits, but it also can have costs.
This response is intertwined with a defensive reaction to the growing role of TNC’s from emerging markets, the “new kids on the block.” Established TNC’s, and their home countries, will need to adjust to this new constellation of forces and its implications for the world market.
Reservations against FDI (as against anything foreign) can be found in all groups of countries, and politicians can bring them to the surface, resulting in protectionism.
Excluding them from the sphere of beings to whom we owe moral consideration can then seem arbitrary, or just plain wrong.
If the average teenager today took an IQ test in 1910, he or she would score 130, which would be better than 98% of those taking the test then.
Recently, together with other scientists, I studied the animals in the human exclusion zone around the plant.
Indeed, as early as a few years after the accident, data collected by Belarusan scientists flying helicopter surveys over the abandoned area showed rising numbers of wild boar, elk, and roe deer.
But a comparison with what happened outside the affected area is instructive.
Are Israel and Syria Ready for Peace?
Such a war could be won only by the total destruction of Lebanon by Israel’s air force.
These are peace talks, not a defense treaty, and Syria would not abruptly disengage from its Iranian friends.
The United States is consistently ranked among the world’s top ten countries for innovation, including by INSEAD’s Global Innovation Index. But, on the Global Peace Index, it is ranked 88th of 153 countries.
Given this, officials, investors, and business leaders in search of revolutionary ideas, cutting-edge solutions, and untapped talent should not allow turbulence in some societies, or tranquility in others, to influence their decisions excessively.
In 2005, 10% of all new businesses in Lebanon were in the creative sector, and the copyright-based industries contributed 4.75% of GDP.
MOSCOW – The economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the West in March 2014 have undoubtedly been painful.
It remains a core message of today’s dominant neoclassical school – embodied in the so-called “Washington Consensus,” adopted across the world under the International Monetary Fund’s advice – which claims that the key to economic development is to open up, deregulate, liberalize, and privatize.
Ultimately, the mechanization of the textile industry ushered in the Industrial Revolution, and mass production and exports underpinned the development of the world’s largest maritime fleet.
Today, by contrast, Russia has a capitalist system that offers considerable benefits to those who adapt best to the restrictions.
Furthermore, Russia’s leadership has accelerated cooperation with the other BRICS economies (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa), and Putin recently announced ambitious plans to boost domestic demand.
Ever since the Industrial Revolution, manufacturing has been the key to rapid economic growth.
As a consequence, developing countries are starting to de-industrialize and become more dependent on services at much lower levels of income than has been the pattern for developed countries – a phenomenon that I have called premature de-industrialization.
It is unclear whether their conclusions extend to other periods.
In principle, many of these activities could benefit from better technologies, improved organization, and greater formalization.
BRUSSELS – The euro area confronts a fundamental crisis that attacks on financial speculators will do nothing to resolve.
Failure is not an option.”
One might object that the distinction between Southern and Northern views is academic nowadays, because failure really isn’t an option, given that it would trigger a disastrous reaction in global financial markets.
Terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia have led many to question not only the ruling House of Saud's prospects for survival, but also whether the kingdom is fundamentally dysfunctional and destructive.
Sixty-two percent of Saudis described themselves as religious, compared with 82% of Iranians, 85% of Jordanians, and 98% of Egyptians.
Little wonder, then, that Egyptians and Jordanians, who live in countries where the state does not enforce piety, are more religious than Iranians or Saudis, who must cope with local "virtue" police backed by the state.
A strong current of liberalism appeared in the late nineteenth century in Ottoman Syria in response to the religious despotism of Sultan Abdulhamid.
But, while strengthening such programs should be a high priority, we should not lose sight of how well middle-income families have actually done over the past few decades.
Any adult who was alive in the US during these three decades realizes that this number grossly understates the gains of the typical household.
To convert annual incomes to real incomes, the CBO used the price deflator for consumer expenditures, which many believe is better for this purpose than the consumer price index.
No one knows how much such product innovations and improvements have added to our wellbeing.
The metaphor of war has the singular advantage that it clearly and strongly evokes the intensity of the counterattack that was called for.
The negative consequences of this mistaken vision very quickly became apparent.
The attraction of this metaphor may be attributable to the excessive trust that Americans place not only in their army, which is understandable, but in force in general, which is much less understandable in the case of an intelligent people.
But America’s strategy has failed.
Throughout history, paradigms of economic power have been drawn and redrawn according to the rise and fall of those countries best equipped to drive global growth and provide stimulus to the global economy.
Broadly, this arrangement still holds today, though hints of its erosion became evident some time ago.
The size and dynamism of China’s economy, and the rapid globalization of its corporations and banks, makes the renminbi especially likely to take on a more important international role.
According to Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, “The decision finally removes all doubts that countries which still do not recognize the Republic of Kosovo could have.”

But the rights of persons and peoples, not just interests of states, are at stake in controversies such as this one.
The story's premise is that the world will run out of oil faster than we thought, as these billions of people chase their dreams of big houses and sport utility vehicles.
Expectations become self-fulfilling, oil prices rise, a speculative bubble is born.
The book launched an international debate on whether the world would soon face immense economic problems due to shortages of oil and other natural resources - problems that seemed to be presaged by OPEC's production cuts eighteen months later.
But don't hold your breath.
· Cut public-sector spending directly, while creating incentives to induce lower private-sector expenditure.
The second problem is timing, with governments struggling to ensure that the measures take effect in the right sequence.
To revive the Argentine economy in a durable and inclusive manner, Macri’s government needs to act fast to mobilize sizeable external financial assistance, generate additional domestic resources, and implement deeper structural reforms.
The decision – a welcome break from a series of decisions by American judges who do not seem to understand the complexities of global financial markets – conveys some important messages.
This brings us to the second lesson of the British ruling.
That ambition has become more attainable in view of the damage to the US system's credibility in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
The country’s largest such crisis, in 2001, brought down the local banking system and caused the Argentine government to default on its debts. The economy contracted by a whopping 18%, and the unemployment rate peaked above 22%.
What saved Argentina over the last decade were highly favorable external conditions: sky-high global commodity prices and technological innovations that greatly increased farm yields.
To stem the outflow of dollars, the central bank may well be forced to raise interest rates.
Under the existing regime, the country had been on a rapid downward spiral of the kind that has now become familiar in Greece and elsewhere in Europe.
That is why, for domestic debt disputes, countries have bankruptcy laws and courts.
Americans have seen how financial firms put their own interests ahead of those of the country – and the world.
The risk of default or debt restructuring induces creditors to be more careful in their lending decisions.
The US court’s tendentious, economically dangerous ruling shows why we need such a system now.
In the past decade, YPF’s reserves diminished significantly, along with those of most oil companies operating in Argentina, because investment in exploration was greatly reduced.
At the same time, the country must modify its consumption model through greater reliance on hydroelectric, nuclear, and wind energy.
Néstor Kirchner, Cristina’s husband and Argentina’s current president, did not want to run for office again, despite being legally permitted to do so and voters’ preference for him over her.
Maybe the most important point – and a key difference with the Clintons – is that this experiment begins in an Argentina that suffers from great institutional vulnerability.
It is a significant achievement.
And, as with humans who mix only with their close relatives, the political gene pool weakens.
Whatever their short-term benefits and popularity, gestures of such gravity always entail serious long-term consequences.
Now all bets are off.
Oil stirs great popular fascination.
CAMBRIDGE – Where are global currencies headed in 2011? After three years of huge, crisis-driven exchange-rate swings, it is useful to take stock both of currency values and of the exchange-rate system as a whole.
By contrast, the financial crisis was hardly an advertisement for expanding the scope of fixed exchange rates.
As for currency collapse, the most prominent candidate has to be the euro.
As for China’s renminbi, it is still supported by a highly political exchange-rate regime.
But is it wise for EU and NATO members to enhance the capacity of non-allies to project their military power? After all, only two and a half years ago, Russia invaded Georgia, a country that NATO had named as a potential future member, and has occupied part of it ever since.
But the common position does not specify the extent to which another member state should be consulted.
Consulting at an early stage would help manage misperceptions – often fueled by reports in the media long before deals are concluded – and thus strengthen convergence and unity among EU member states.
These issues are of concern to all allies, so discussions should not be confined to bilateral agendas.
At worst, however, it creates an image of arrogance that can only undermine the credibility on which central banks’ authority rests.
If the choice at any particular moment is to provide support or let the system collapse, you should choose support.
But bankers strongly reject this approach (because it would likely lower their pay), as do central bankers (because they are too much persuaded by the protestation of bankers).
This is a good story, full of human drama and power politics.
The computers gradually improved, but they still seemed far inferior to the top humans.
Until a short while ago, I could certainly distinguish a computer from a human opponent.
But the level that computers have reached already is scary enough.
MUNICH – Artificial intelligence, once confined to the realm of science fiction, is changing our lives. Cars are driving themselves.
Apple is shifting some manufacturing from China to Silicon Valley; Airtex Design Group is moving part of its textile production from China back to the United States.
In Austria, the share of people with a university degree or its equivalent increased by 250% between 1996 and 2012.
It is now at about 58% of GDP.
What implications does China’s emergence onto the global stage hold for southern Africa? Can China help lift the world’s poorest region out of its deep economic and political malaise?
Moreover, these services are set to benefit from the broader trade expansion with China, potentially establishing a virtuous circle of investment and exports.
With WTO negotiations underway and an expanding free-trade agenda taking hold, those tariffs are under pressure.
On balance, then southern Africa clearly stands to benefit economically from China’s emergence as a global power.
As Song Siming, a handsome, successful, and Audi-driving – but also married – secretary to the Mayor, tells her, “On those unsightly corners in the dark where dirt, flies, and rats wander, nobody's paying attention.”
“Wo Ju” is an adaptation of a novel about recent skyrocketing housing prices in Chinese cities – especially in Shanghai – and the effect of real-estate fever on young Chinese men and women in today’s get-rich-by-any-means China.
As Song arrogantly says to Guo before he dies, “As long as it’s a problem that we can solve with money, then it’s not a big problem.”
More and more young women are making just such practical choices: putting an apartment before love and pragmatism before principle.
The peak ratio and the subsequent downward trajectory depend crucially on the assumed pace of economic growth.
But a revival of economic growth in the short term is unlikely.
If the interest rate is higher than the growth rate, austerity is required;&nbsp;the wider the gap, the more austerity is needed.
Given that perpetual austerity is untenable and others in Europe can only do so much, without robust growth the options will narrow quickly.
All three are raising serious doubts, in different ways, about their commitment to the rule of law, the integrity of their judicial systems, and the quality of mercy in the administration of justice.
Many do want to end, once and for all, the corrupt, vote-buying culture that has long afflicted Thai politics on both sides.
What does not yet seem to have registered with Jokowi, or with enough of his fellow citizens, is the incongruity of refusing even to consider clemency for those on Indonesia's death row, while lobbying passionately for clemency for more than 200 Indonesians condemned to die elsewhere, notably in the Gulf.
But that is no longer true in today's interconnected world.
Approval by the association’s foreign ministers may come in September, with ASEAN leaders tackling the issue in October.
Western sanctions instead paved the way for investments in Myanmar by those with less concern about human rights violations – first by ASEAN neighbors in hotels and other sectors, and more recently by China and India, which are vying for projects and influence in the strategic energy sector.
Such dialogue is vital if Myanmar is to be prevented from possibly pursuing nuclear weapons and rigging elections, à la Iran.
Japan, too – still the largest Asian economy and a traditional donor to the region – must also play a role.
And the major emerging economies are all slowing, with Russia practically at a standstill.
Disappointing export performance is largely responsible for the recent weakening of economic-growth prospects.
Fiscal stimulus by these three countries – together with smaller contributions from France and China – could have continued the necessary healing.
After a spike earlier in the year, Japan’s exports have also contracted.
The US, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and China should act together to provide that boost.
Indeed, in the 6-12 months prior to every crisis, the IMF’s forecasts implied business as usual.
Malaysia’s imposition of capital controls was a controversial policy decision.
The fall in property prices was modest relative to Ireland and Spain, and, because there was no construction boom, there was no construction bust.
If so, a fundamental question may well become unavoidable: Why does the IMF exist, and for whom?
When it does not, the IMF publishes another rendition of the same claims.
American consumers remain scarred by the crisis.
The technical lead held by Europe’s traditional trading economies is being eroded, while wage competition is encouraging fears of deflation.
New bus routes between India and Pakistan may not make headlines, but they deliver a degree of normalcy to relations riddled with mistrust.
Roughly 80% of China’s energy imports pass through that potential chokepoint, which is mostly policed by the US Navy.
From Bangkok, the line will run east through Cambodia and north through Vietnam to Hanoi, then through Laos and back to Kunming.
The question is whether Asia’s infrastructure investments, particularly those by China, will be used to create Asian satellites of the Middle Kingdom, or become tools to be used among equals.
Other players on the grand chessboard of Asian geopolitics also are seeking to formulate new equations, as they concurrently pursue strategies of hedging, balancing, and bandwagoning.
The US is now courting Vietnam as well, and the two countries are even negotiating a civilian nuclear deal.
If China, India, and Japan constitute a scalene strategic triangle in Asia, with China representing the longest side, side A, the sum of side B (India) and side C (Japan) will always be greater than A. Not surprisingly, the fastest-growing relationship in Asia today is probably between Japan and India.
Each of them could pursue game-changing initiatives if only they could summon the necessary statesmanship.
South Korean President Park Geun-hye: “I will&nbsp;remove the ‘May 24’ sanctions we placed on North Korea after their military provocations in 2010, because they are making impossible nearly all of the measures to build trust and confidence that I keep saying are necessary.
But if I can make it believable, it will do more to win the US friendship, respect, and ultimate security in East Asia and around the world than our trillion-dollar nuclear-weapons modernization program or all the unworkable and counter-productive missile-defense systems at which we keep hurling money.
For the second time in less than four years, Asia is being hit with a major external demand shock.
Historically, the US was modern Asia’s largest source of external demand.
By 2010, the EU accounted for 20% of total Chinese exports, while the US share was just 18%.
Yet the region has failed to construct that firewall.
Until that occurs, the vice now gripping Asia will only continue to tighten.
Indeed, Xi implicitly criticized the existing US-dominated security architecture in Asia as stuck in the Cold War, and characterized “military alliance targeted at a third party” as “not conducive to maintaining common security.”
Most notably, China has established new development institutions, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the new Silk Road Fund, to which it will channel tens of billions of dollars – clear challenges to the established Western-dominated multilateral institutions.
Most of China’s neighbors, even North Korea, fear an unconstrained Chinese hegemon – and, if the US security presence were eliminated, that is precisely what they would face.
Asia in the Balance
Nevertheless, strategic anxiety lurks below the surface, particularly in India.
After market-oriented reforms in the early 1990’s, growth rates soared, with projections of double-digit growth in the future.
India’s GDP of $3.3 trillion compares to China’s $5 trillion, and is 20% that of the United States.
Indian officials are generally discrete in public about relations with China, but in private their concerns remain intense.
Above all, I seek results.
You expect nothing.
Asia’s contribution to the UN, though significant, could be greater.
As an Asian Secretary-General, I hope to see this change.
In the coming decades, this burgeoning demographic segment will serve as a keystone for economic and political development in the region, with significant implications for the rest of the world.
Indeed, Asia’s growing middle class will transform a region known as a global manufacturing hub into a consumption powerhouse.
By participating actively in politics, basing their electoral choices on rational self-interest, and developing the sense of moderation needed to resist dictatorship, the middle class promotes democratic progress.
The list of major national political leaders in the region who have faced, or are about to face, criminal charges has grown so extensive that it is plausible to wonder whether democracy itself can survive in a number of these countries.
Singh’s questioning by government prosecutors is perhaps the least worrying case, because India’s democracy is rock-solid, and its judiciary is fearsomely jealous of its independence.
Shinawatra’s overthrow by the military was clearly a bid by the country’s generals to end by force the electoral lock that she and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra – himself a former prime minister who was deposed by a military coup in 2006 – have had on Thailand for almost 15 years.
Putting one’s opponents in the criminal dock seems unlikely to produce a similar result.
Already eyeing a third term, he can count on political longevity on the order of Mahathir’s 22-year rule.
The region-wide crisis in 1997, weak progress on free trade, and the region’s security vulnerabilities have made Thaksin aware of ASEAN’s limitations.
Only late last year did he admit that southern Muslim separatism was the cause.
If he is enlightened enough to make amends with disaffected southerners and move beyond his vested interests in Myanmar, he retains a good shot at becoming Asia’s next spokesman.
China’s government responded to this by encouraging manufacturers to move into the country’s vast hinterland, where wages are much lower.
Bangladesh, too, is starting to join Asia’s production chains, which is one reason why it has experienced strong growth since the return to the premiership of Sheikh Hasina in 2009.
Were China to adopt an exchange-rate regime characterized by a multiple-currency, basket-based reference rate with a reasonably wide band – a policy first proposed by Willem Thorbecke of the Asian Development Bank Institute – the huge surpluses generated within Asia’s production networks would cause the region’s currencies to appreciate together, instead of putting pressure on just one or two, as is happening today.
Such challenges dictate greater US-China cooperation to ensure continued large capital inflows from China, as well as Chinese political support on difficult issues ranging from North Korea and Burma to Pakistan and Iran.
Central to Asia’s future is the strategic triangle made up of China, India, and Japan.
But in Asia, the wars since 1950 failed to resolve disputes.
Most Asian countries are recovering strongly from the global recession that set in following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
In 1989, before the Tiananmen Square incident, the renminbi’s exchange rate was 45% higher than it is now – a level that could be re-attained relatively soon.
Indeed, the country desperately requires strong political leadership to prevent a Greek scenario – political leadership that it is unlikely to find.
First, the volume of JGBs has soared relative to Japanese household assets.
So the future in Asia now appears to belong to China, whose economic growth supports that of neighboring countries – and whose mercantilism is prevailing in the region.
There is no shortage of examples.
The elected president wants to act, but the assembly refuses to approve the necessary laws.
But the danger in a weakened democracy is not merely blocked legislation and ineffective government.
Cohabitation could very soon become a problem even in the quasi-democracy of Hong Kong, if voters there on September 12 elect a legislature hostile to Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's Beijing-anointed chief executive, later this month.
Indeed, the precedents of democratic immobility in Asia are hardly encouraging.
Indira Gandhi’s brief “emergency rule” in the 1970’s was partly the result of such institutional dysfunction.
Given these precedents, perhaps Asian policymakers should consider the merits of doing away with “cohabitation” and adopting systems where electoral victory translates into real power.
What is stoppable is the steep rise in Asia’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Both China and India can learn a lot from Japan, and both governments, fortunately, are firmly committed to increasing their energy efficiency and use of green technology.
In Singapore, regulators are developing an innovative Electricity Vending System to give 1.2 million consumers real-time price signals so that they can learn to conserve electricity during peak periods.
The G-8’s declaration that its members will reduce carbon emissions by 80% in 2050 contains no upfront commitments. And the clock is ticking.
But will Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao live up to that standard, as conveyed in the Analects of Confucius, on his current visit to India?
The sources of those tensions are clear: North Korea’s shelling of South Korea’s Yeonpyeong Island and its flaunting of a modern, previously unknown, nuclear plant; the US-led armada now cruising through the South China and Yellow Sea; and China’s claim that the South China Sea is an area of vital national interest akin to Tibet.
China’s problems arise mainly from widening income disparities, which are inciting hitherto unheard of levels of labor unrest – though this should not be viewed as a precursor to change of the sort that marked the rise of the Solidarity trade union and the end of communism in Poland.
By contrast, India’s most important national security concerns – the unsettled border between the two countries, and Beijing’s ties with Pakistan, which often operates as a Chinese surrogate – are closely connected to China: Both factors are directly linked to China’s perceived threat to India’s Himalayan territory and its rapid development of strategic infrastructure in that region.

Some even call for establishing a US-China G-2.
It resuscitated its World War II enemies and fostered economic development in countries around the world, and established a security umbrella that helped Europe and Asia focus more on diplomacy and economic growth than on military competition.
China and Japan, Japan and Korea, India and Pakistan, Singapore and Malaysia, and many other pairings of states connect on some levels, but remain dangerously divided on others.
Asia’s Inflation Trap

Export-led economies, of course, can’t take currency appreciation lightly – it undermines competitiveness and risks eroding the country’s share of the global market. It also invites destabilizing hot-money capital inflows.
So far, the Chinese leadership has adopted a measured approach to inflation.
Inflation, if not addressed now, could seriously compromise the region’s ability to meet those challenges.
Recent Chinese statements declare the islands a “core interest,” terms usually reserved for Taiwan and Tibet.
A shift of relative strategic influence and strength is discernible, especially given the rise of India and China.
The US has shown interest in a multilateral path to engagement with Asia on strategic issues.
But they also must acknowledge and attend to the post-crisis challenges facing the region as a whole.
One or several tipping points would most likely bring the process to a screeching halt.
Their growth patterns and strategies, and the tradeoffs and choices they make with respect to lifestyle, urbanization, transportation, the environment, and energy efficiency, will largely determine whether their economies can complete the long transition to advanced-income levels.
The large, high-growth emerging economies have certain advantages.
As Asians drive growth toward more sustainable patterns, they will increase the incentives for others to do so by generating new technology, lowering the environmental cost of growth, and undercutting the argument that leadership incurs competitive and other economic costs, but few benefits.
In addition, the formation of a China-Japan-South Korea FTA would most likely trigger a chain-reaction.
South Korea has already concluded an FTA with the US, after years of difficult negotiations, and plans to negotiate a bilateral FTA with China this year.
For China, political considerations seem to be the strongest motivation for pursuing a Northeast Asian FTA.
Asia’s Overlooked Great Power
Japan now spends more than $40 billion a year on defense and maintains one of the world’s most diverse and modern militaries.
On one hand, he is wise not to have visited the Yasukuni shrine, which honors millions of Japan’s war dead, including 14 Class A war criminals.
There is no reason Japan should not hold a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council.
Abe’s visit to Washington in late April is an opportunity to continue to modernize a relationship conceived in an earlier geopolitical era.
Historically, it has been difficult to convince Asians that international trade is not a zero-sum-game, with Asia invariably the losers.
One result of this is that China and India are seeking to make a bigger impact on global economic policy.
This is of vital importance, especially in light of the fact that Asia’s populations are still booming: India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh will see an increase in the next fifteen years from 1.4 billion to 1.73 billion inhabitants, while China’s population will grow from 1.3 billion to 1.42 billion.
Yet euroatlantic introversion still permeates the WTO.
And yet the Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and the Republican nominee, John McCain, continue to tiptoe around such issues.
Will you back – or back away from – free trade pacts with Asia?
He or she should start now by answering Asia’s questions.
Maintaining growth in the face of a global slowdown is a daunting task, and it requires rethinking the future of “factory Asia.”
Making Asia’s service sector more dynamic is essential to future growth.
Developing the service sector could also diversify the production base, thereby enhancing economic resilience and boosting growth momentum.
Many argue that regulations protect small domestic firms against undue competition from large foreign firms.
SEOUL – Like many regions of the world, Northeast Asia faces severe political challenges in creating a viable structure of peace.
Indeed, any breakthrough to the sort of trust needed to resolve these festering security disputes will require that the three countries establish their annual gatherings as a meaningful multilateral body in its own right – one that can address major issues in dispute and plan for a better regional future.
South Korea and China have already finished a feasibility study for a bilateral FTA, and probably will enter into formal negotiations soon.
The Short Asian Century?
Indeed, vast production chains linking businesses across countries gave the impression of a uniquely Asian superstructure. As long as the region’s economies were thriving, there was little incentive to identify – much less address – the problems facing them.
Malaysia and Thailand also face a near-existential choice between continuing on their current paths – one-party ethnocracy in Malaysia and elite/military rule in Thailand – and beginning a process of political reconciliation, aimed at bringing large, marginalized portions of their populations into the fold. So far, however, it seems that both countries’ leaders are blind to the choice facing them.
In my visit last month, the wall was adorned by a large map of Karnataka festooned with colored pins, to indicate that he now served most district capitals in the remotest parts of the state.
China has traded much investment in physical infrastructure in places otherwise shunned – Angola, Sudan, and Zimbabwe – for access to natural resources.
Consider Olam, a Singapore-headquartered but Africa-centric global agribusiness company.  From the soybean farms of Brazil’s Matto Grosso to the granaries of Ukraine, Olam is prized for its ability to add value in disparate conditions.
Asian Nationalism at Sea
In Europe, while Greeks may grumble about the terms of German backing for emergency financing, the period since World War II has seen enormous progress in knitting countries together.
Consider the Senkaku incident in 2010, when, after Japan arrested the crew of a Chinese trawler that had rammed a Japanese coast guard vessel, China escalated its economic reprisals.
In 1995, and again in 2010, the US declared that the waters of the South China Sea should be governed by the 1982 United Nations Law of the Seas Treaty (which, ironically, the US has not yet ratified), but that the US takes no position on the territorial claims.
Asia Adrift
This new emphasis on regional security is not confined to governments.
The landslide election of Shinzo Abe, who campaigned on a robust defense platform, may well lead to a serious Japanese push to invigorate the country’s military capabilities.
A country that is “unstable at the grass roots, dejected in the middle strata and out of control at the top,” as a group of Chinese scholars recently put it, may see adventurism abroad as the best means of maintaining unity at home.
The Chilean military strongman Augusto Pinochet, for example, imposed his own version of capitalism with an iron fist, and, though Margaret Thatcher and Friedrich von Hayek admired him, hardly anyone reveres him today.
There are good reasons to doubt this thesis.
It is to his credit that he made this work in Singapore, though at some cost. Singapore may be efficient, and relatively free of corruption; but it is also a rather sterile place, with little room for intellectual or artistic achievement.

2013 ग्लोबल हंगर इंडेक्स (जीएचआई) के अनुसार, 78 सबसे अधिक भूखे देशों में भारत का स्थान 63वाँ है, यह स्थिति उसके पड़ोसी देश श्रीलंका (43वाँ), नेपाल (49वाँ), पाकिस्तान (57वाँ) और बांग्लादेश (58वाँ) की तुलना में बहुत अधिक खराब है। पिछली चौथाई सदी में भारत में काफी सुधार होने के बावजूद – इसकी जीएचआई रेटिंग 1990 के 32.6 से बढ़कर 2013 में 21.3 हो गई है – संयुक्त राष्ट्र खाद्य और कृषि संगठन का मानना है कि 17% भारतीय अभी भी इतने अधिक कुपोषित हैं कि वे उत्पादक जीवन नहीं जी सकते। वास्तव में, दुनिया के एक-तिहाई कुपोषित लोग भारत में रहते हैं, इनकी संख्या पूरे उप-सहारा अफ्रीका से अधिक है।
इससे पूरी तस्वीर सामने नहीं आती: उदाहरण के लिए,माँस के मामले में बर्बाद होनेवाले खाद्य का अंश लगभग 4% है लेकिन यह खाद्य की लागत का 20% होता है, जबकि फल और सब्जी के उत्पादन का 70% अंश बर्बाद होता है, जो कुल लागत का 40% होता है। भले ही भारत दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा दूध उत्पादक है और फल और सब्जियों को उगाने की मात्रा की दृष्टि से (चीन के बाद) दूसरा सबसे बड़ा उत्पादक है, लेकिन यह दुनिया में सबसे अधिक खाद्य बर्बादी करने वाला देश भी है। नतीजतन, फल और सब्जियों की कीमतें जितनी अन्यथा होनी चाहिए उनसे दुगुनी हैं, और दूध की कीमत जितनी होनी चाहिए, वह उससे 50% अधिक है।
यदि खाद्य उत्पादन के 35-40% को सड़ने के लिए छोड़ दिया जाता है तो भारत के पास भारत के भावी 1.7 बिलियन लोगों को पर्याप्त पौष्टिक भोजन उपलब्ध कराने के लिए पर्याप्त कृषि योग्य भूमि, सिंचाई, या ऊर्जा नहीं होगी। इसलिए नई मोदी सरकार को भारत के खाद्य संकट को हल करने के लिए वैकल्पिक उपायों पर विचार करना चाहिए।
Nevertheless, Hugo Chávez is right to be nervous.
Venezuela ’s circle of friends in the region is shrinking.
The outcome may well be that these countries leave the OAS, and seek refuge in the new organization that they just established.
This is the period, incidentally, when the embezzler has his gain and the man who has been embezzled feels no loss.
The joy of the bezzle is that two people – each ignorant of the other’s existence and role – can enjoy the same wealth.
And the market is prone to temporary fits of shared enthusiasm – for emerging-market debt, for Internet stocks, for residential mortgage-backed securities, for Greek government debt.
And the opportunity to switch between the trading book and the banking book creates ready opportunities for financial institutions to realize gains and park losses.
The Palestinian Authority’s president, senior diplomats of the countries involved in the Palestine-Israel peace process, and the secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation all attended the two-day summit.
A new constitution, proposed by the king and adopted in a referendum in July 2011, has already generated robust political competition. Meanwhile, a new National Initiative for Human Development is helping to end poverty and social exclusion among Morocco’s most vulnerable citizens, especially women.
Morocco already provides expertise in finance, telecoms, energy, agriculture, and food security across the continent; indeed, it is now Africa’s second-largest investor, after South Africa.
This is a consistent finding of opinion polls in westernized countries.
Although Belgium recently followed the Dutch way of regulating voluntary active euthanasia in a strictly medicalized framework, it is precisely this sort of regulation that is increasingly challenged.
Recent developments in the Netherlands have also shown that euthanasia is discussed more in the context of autonomy, control, and rational choice rather than of uncontrollable medical symptoms.
My detention here is the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
So, one day, in November 1999, the Tajik authorities rounded up 200-300 Uzbeks and said they were taking us back to Uzbekistan. Instead, they dumped us in Afghanistan.
The Americans now realize that I ended up here by mistake and have told me that they want to let me go.
Many factors may be pushing China’s economy in this direction.
To avoid such an internal “sovereign debt crisis,” China’s Budget Law, adopted in 1994, forbade local governments from borrowing autonomously, either by issuing bonds to the public or by getting credits from banks.
Then came the financial crisis, with the central government adopting fiscal stimulus and relaxing monetary policy.
The most important change that may keep the problem manageable is that China’s monetary authorities have been putting the brake on the growth of these debts since late last year.
Otherwise, China might already have experienced its own localized “sovereign debt” crisis and, perhaps, hyper-inflation.
Such a stalemate is not new.
Despite their hawkish approach to North Korea’s nuclear threats, South Korean officials know that uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing remains only a distant possibility. As a result, they are approaching negotiations skeptically, rather than emphasizing the sense of mutual obligation that should characterize the alliance.
They know that their cities are also vulnerable to urban violence, in so far as they have pockets of social inequality, including marginalized and excluded young people.
Yet these violent acts can be viewed as a political conflict in the sense that young people are directly challenging the state by attacking its representatives.
But all public actors, not just the police, must respond to urban problems.
BERKELEY – The party platform adopted at the Republican National Convention includes a number of remarkable planks.
But accountability by audit would carry significant risks.
So President Herbert Hoover created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, an independent government agency, to aid illiquid but fundamentally sound banks.
Can we trust politicians to understand and respect this, especially in an election year? It is no coincidence that the demand by Congress for the list of RFC loans occurred in 1932, also a presidential election year.
Many inside and outside of Germany declare that both austerity and more growth are needed, and that more emphasis on growth does not mean any decrease in austerity.
Second, it is possible, though not easy, to choose fiscal-consolidation packages that are more growth-friendly than others.
Countries like Germany that are running a current-account surplus would also help themselves by helping to stimulate the European economy as a whole.
What we are witnessing – and what is now affecting the whole world – is a man-made disaster that can be stopped and reversed by a coordinated policy response.
Of course, there is an appealing logic to saying that governments should have to balance their budgets just like the rest of us; unfortunately, it is not so simple.
But it is wrong to think that massive accumulation of debt is a free lunch.
Moreover, carrying a huge debt burden runs the risk that global interest rates will rise in the future, even absent a Greek-style meltdown.
Some see another Weimar moment, reminiscent of the belt-tightening and surging unemployment that characterized Heinrich Brüning’s Germany and helped to bring the Nazis to power.
Then there is the most fundamental – and hence easily overlooked – difference of all.
These differences were not trivial.
Indeed, the political turmoil caused by the crisis has broken the back of the old two-party system.
But it does illustrate how rapidly in early twenty-first-century Europe democracy has been undermined through the endless application of the economics of austerity, and by the failure of political leadership at home and abroad.
In Britain back then, Philip Snowden, a small man with a narrow, pinched face, who needed a cane to walk, seemed to want to remake the British economy in his physical image.
As a result, fiscal consolidation appeared to be the only way to restore confidence.
The balanced budget thus allowed Britain to have a strong recovery, ensuring that the 1930’s were a much better decade for the British economy than the 1920’s had been.
Greece in the spring of 2010 sent a wake-up call to Great Britain.
A review of policy discussions from 314 IMF country reports published since 2010 – part of a comprehensive update on the global shift toward austerity – shows that many adjustment measures are most prevalent in developing countries, where citizens are especially vulnerable to austerity’s economic and social consequences.
They must recognize that austerity will not help them to achieve their development goals.
Selama beberapa tahun terakhir saya sering membaca dan menyukai tulisan Krauthammer, namun ada satu hal dalam buku beliau yang menurut saya sangat meresahkan: cara beliau menggambarkan dirinya sebagai seorang “agnostik” perubahan iklim.
Tentunya masih ada penolakan, contohnya Perdana Menteri Australia Tony Abbott, yang menggantikan pajak karbon (carbon tax) dengan rencana memungut pajak dari warga negaranya untuk membayar pencemar agar mengurangi emisi. Sebagai suatu kebijakan, gagasan ini tidak adil, tidak efisien, dan tidak mungkin bisa menurunkan emisi pada laju yang cukup untuk memenuhi persyaratan perjanjian internasional tentang perubahan iklim yang diharapkan bisa dicapai di Paris bulan Desember nanti.
NEW YORK – The times we live in are often most clearly reflected in the mirror of art.
Everything in this new China – where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) still rules, but the ideas of Karl Marx are as dead as they are in Russia – is for sale, even the trappings of its Maoist past.
Judges are bought or intimidated to ensure that bosses remain above the law.
This great twentieth century myth has now been shattered.
Leviathan, by contrast, has been submitted as the official Russian entry for the Oscars.
I was punched and kicked as the police looked the other way.
On the contrary, one of them has been promoted to command the newly formed (and US-funded) Jakarta Anti-Terror Unit.
Given such flawed proceedings, my conviction and prison sentence come as no surprise. But I remain hopeful that we will prevail in the end, when higher courts hear Tempo's appeal.
Two parliamentary elections and two direct presidential elections - including the latest presidential run-off - have been free, fair, and peaceful, proving that Islam and democracy can coexist.
Most people do not seem to think very hard about how much to save from their income, or about how big the differences in their wealth could be in their later years if they just adjusted their saving rate today.
Thoughtful leaders recognize that the problem is there and tangible, not to be ignored.
Nevertheless, according to Brigitte Madrian of Harvard University, automatic enrollment in savings plans is critically important, even if the employee is completely free to drop out.
The fundamental problem is that while some people postpone saving for sensible reasons, and will resume saving later, many others fail to save for no good reason, and are unlikely to make up for it later.
And, in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, these countries’ overall economic growth has been meager, too – just 4% or less on average.
One explanation is that employment in the years before the crisis was being propped up by credit-fueled demand.
In that sense, productivity rose in the tradable sector, although structural shifts in the global economy were surely as important as employees becoming more efficient at doing the same things.
Then the Internet became generally available, businesses reorganized themselves and their global supply chains, and productivity accelerated.
While their stated aim was to save the euro, the government leaders involved did exactly the opposite, producing increased nervousness and volatility in financial markets, which in turn exacerbated Ireland’s problems.
But the fundamental change of strategy within Germany’s European policy can no longer be overlooked.
Staggered alignment of economic and social policies (such as the legal retirement age), new balancing schemes (euro bonds as a transfer instrument), and an effective stability mechanism are all needed to preserve the common currency.
Both countries together, however, must inaugurate the step towards economic union, which requires that both governments actually want that.
I also believe that just as an individual’s dreams and slips of the tongue reveal his or her repressed knowledge, so a culture’s “dreamwork” – its films, pop music, visual arts, and even in the resonant jokes, cartoons and advertising images – reveal the signs of this collective unconscious.
When the villain, the American military leader of the attack, plans to bomb flat the indigenous people’s sacred tree, he boasts that he will blow such a massive hole in their “racial memory” that they won’t come “within a thousand clicks” of the place again.
The indigenous people are an amalgam of echoes from all the great wars of empire that have troubled the recent American conscience.
But, in the case of Avatar , the power of American filmmaking has for once been directed toward American self-knowledge rather than American escapism.
The sharing economy also boosts entrepreneurship, as people see new ways to fill gaps in the market.
TaskRabbit, which subcontracts household jobs like assembling Ikea furniture, requires participants to pay a minimum wage, and has launched an insurance scheme to protect its US workers.
None of this will be easy.
MUNICH – Carlos Barientos III was born at 6:45 on the evening of December 31, 1964, a few miles northwest of Honolulu.
By contrast, Barientos and the other boomers of 1964 grew up playing video games and listening to disco music – or, if their tastes were closer to those of Barientos, the heavier sounds of Gary Moore, Thin Lizzy, and Van Halen.
Not that Barientos would swap places with his father.
I went to Maryland to visit a friend for two weeks and ended up staying five years because I loved it so much.”
Back to Afghanistan
Security, too, remains a serious concern.
At the national level, the government recently approved a new development strategy that goes far to advance a vision for Afghanistan’s future stability and growth.
Currently, the judiciary is incapable of trying a case of petty theft much less of ensuring human rights.
NEWPORT BEACH – What if members of the United States Congress, now returning from their summer recess, were to receive a “back to school” letter from concerned citizens? Here is what a first draft might look like.
China, once the world’s unstoppable growth engine, is slowing.
According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, your support among us, the electorate, stands at just 12%.
·         Fiscal reform: We desperately need you to eliminate the looming fiscal cliff in the context of medium-term reforms of both the tax system and entitlements.
·         Global policy coordination: America’s traditional leadership role has evaporated in recent years as our problems have made us more insular and inward-looking.
The campaign for Ukraine’s parliamentary election of September 30th is scarcely underway and yet Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych is already trying to steal it.
Recent history is replete with alarming examples of dictators and would be dictators who refuse to recognize when their time has run out.
So other pressure will need to be applied, primarily by the European Union and the United States.
However, it will make the job of repressing them much harder.
But in the history of international finance over the past sixty years, bankruptcy and default are almost unheard of.
Such a system worked as long as events in one country did not have a negative impact on other borrowers and there was no systemic risk or systemic contagion.
Instead of defaulting, countries arranged rescue packages with the IMF.
The second major shock came with Argentina's currency collapse of 2002-3, after which Argentina's government demanded an extremely large debt write-off.
Without question the most successful central banker of the twentieth century, Volcker was an early and persistent voice warning of the problems of what he called “the bright new financial system.”
Then, as now, many people demanded some punishment for the banks and bankers.
But, unfortunately, the most obvious way for banks to increase their capital ratios is to curtail their lending.
But, whereas we only recently learned that financial behemoths create financial instability, foreign-exchange markets for a long time were characterized by volatility and uncertainty.
Moreover, Kazakhstan, though a Muslim majority country, has established the type of secular, multi-ethnic, and multi religious polity that the West is seeking to encourage throughout the Muslim world.
Its selection to lead the OSCE is seen as a reward for President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s policy of engagement with the West.
Moreover, Kazakhstan is already in formal talks with the EU about human rights issues.
Back to the Politics of Cultural Despair
For many, the alternative to capitalism and globalization is an idyllic image of a “European social model,” which no one has yet defined.
In a different way, this is true of Italy as well.
A sense of frustration that results from anti-capitalist, anti-globalization sentiment leads to a lethal combination of Arcadian dreams (“France to the French”) and the reality of ruthless, if seductive, leaders on the right (Jean-Marie Le Pen in France) and the left (Oskar Lafontaine and his new party in Germany).
The US was “exporting inflation.”
Back then, international monetary diplomacy focused on creating a new form of international reserves, what became the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights.
While the IMF, in a high-profile report on exchange rates in mid-1970, endorsed the principle of greater flexibility, it offered no new ideas for getting countries to move in this direction and proposed no new sanctions against countries that resisted.
PARIS – France no longer claims center stage in world history, but it remains influential beyond its national borders.
Democracy is about normal citizens electing normal men and women to lead them for a limited period according to established rules.
In other words, one-third of French voters are now attracted to candidates with extreme ideologies that share an anti-liberal rejection of the euro, capitalism, and globalization.
Indeed, both Hollande and Sarkozy represented those adapted to globalization and viewed the rest as a reservoir of voters to be seduced, not as a new underclass.
The cultural rights of the large Kurdish minority, including the right to use their own language, had advanced greatly.
If the process leading to EU accession is put back on track, it will greatly aid the effort to ensure that Turkey becomes an open society.
As a role model for the region, it is especially important that Turkey should practice press freedom.
We gritted our teeth and for the sake of our national economies supported our governments as they bailed out the banks with public money.
Ibrahim has established a foundation whose main purpose is to raise standards of governance in Africa.
It is not as though Africa lacked resources or the ability to govern itself well.
As Spike Mulligan was unable to discover for himself, money really can make people happier, producing a more just world with greater opportunity for the poor and disadvantaged.
But its basic approach remained critically flawed. First, it relied – once again – on trickle-down economics: somehow, throwing enough money at Wall Street would trickle down to Main Street, helping ordinary workers and homeowners.
Even if a bailout plan were implemented quickly – which appears increasingly unlikely – there would be some credit contraction.
This approach is not only proven, but it also provides both the incentives and wherewithal needed for lending to resume. It avoids the hopeless task of trying to value millions of complex mortgages and the even more complex financial products in which they are embedded, and it deals with the “lemons” problem – the government gets stuck with the worst or most overpriced assets.
But turning them over to the government at market value doesn’t improve banks’ balance sheet; to do that requires overpaying for the assets, a transfer of wealth from ordinary taxpayers to the banks..
Debt-Friendly Stimulus
This kind of enlightened stimulus runs into strong prejudices.
If individuals were rational and well informed, they might conclude that they should not spend more, despite tax cuts, since the cuts are not real.
But that should be okay, especially if we all have jobs.
Balancing Asia\u0027s Rivals
But that was true for much of the Cold War, when they frequently talked past each other.
Trade between India and American is increasing, and reached $26 billion (11% of India’s total trade) in 2006.
The two countries’ recent rapprochement marks a considerable change from the hostility that bedeviled their relations following their 1962 war over a disputed border in the Himalayas.
Balancing China’s High Savings
It runs a trade deficit only when it invests a lot while simultaneously not limiting consumption.
Rather, savings should be channeled even more – and more efficiently – to domestic investment in order to avoid large external imbalances.
China must recognize that high savings will not provide stable growth over the long run.
It is against this backdrop that I find welcome this weekend’s announcement by a group of major economies acknowledging their shared responsibility for the orderly resolution of global imbalances while sustaining robust growth.
This is the first time such plans have been presented together.
The aim of multilateral consultation was not to seek to solve imbalances in one fell swoop, but rather to solidify agreement on a medium-term approach that could reduce imbalances gradually over time.
I wrote those words with the French political scientist Jacques Rupnik in 1991, just as war was breaking out among Yugoslavia’s successor states.
In particular, they criticized the EU, NATO, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for describing the upsurge in violence as a series of “isolated incidents.”
Similar sentiments are evident in Bosnia, and even in Croatia, an EU member since 2013.
Ever-closer ties with Europe remain the best way forward for the region’s residents and the EU alike.
Yet Ban has inspired global confidence in his leadership to the point of securing an uncontested and unanimous second mandate.
It is a workload that boggles the mind, and demands the round-the-clock commitment of the Secretary-General and his team.
Far too little has been accomplished since, and, behind the scenes, Ban is working relentlessly to clear the bottlenecks and avert climate disaster.
It is a story of decency, commitment, and generosity that has won global confidence, and that can help to guide the world at a time of unprecedented risks and unique opportunities.
इसके अलावा हैती के स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय तथा पैन-अमेरिक��� हेल्थ ऑर्गनाइजेशन/विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन मिलकर एक व्यापक टीकाकरण अभियान के द्वितीय चरण की शुरूआत कर रहे हैं. संयुक्त राष्ट्र द्वारा वित्तपोषित इस अभियान में उन इलाकों के छह लाख लोगों को हैजा के टीके लगाए जाएंगे जहां इस बीमारी का सर्वाधिक प्रकोप है. दो लाख लोगों को अगले कुछ महिनों में तथा तीन लाख लोगों को इस साल के अंत तक टीके लगाए जाएंगे. पिछले साल प्रथम चरण के दौरान एक लाख लोगों को प्रतिरोधात्मक टीके लगाए गए थे.

In Darfur, he managed to get African Union peacekeepers into Sudan’s killing zone in his first year in office through intensive behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
He has regularly defended the Palestinians’ rights to a state, but he also condemned Hamas’s rocket attacks on southern Israel.
In his own way, though, he is an engaging, polite man, hip to contemporary cultural icons, and even given to singing at public occasions with wry lyrics and verses.
Is Bangladesh headed into the black hole that consumed Afghanistan under the Taliban? Fears are mounting, as official and fundamentalist religious forces now seem to operate with impunity – and the apparent support of local police, the ruling Bangladeshi National Party, and local authorities.
In 1999, Huji members attempted to assassinate the moderate poet Shamshur Rahman with an axe.
The atmosphere of violence is palpable in other ways.
Pressure from India will not be enough to force the Bengali government to adhere to the tolerant form of Islam that the country pursued during its first three decades of independence.
This can be achieved through a program for subsistence farmers that not only improves productivity, but also reduces weather dependency and provides simple financing instruments to encourage investment in new technologies and equipment, increased land ownership, and easier access to local markets.
As part of an FAO project in Burkina Faso, the EU’s Food Facility has helped to provide high-quality seeds to 100,000 vulnerable farmers, benefiting roughly 700,000 people amid the growing food crisis in the Sahel region.
But problems at the top of the food system must be addressed as well.
Since then, countries around the world have made their central banks independent.
The Fed does not keep a voting record, but “dissents” from its major decisions are noted (these were almost unheard of when Alan Greenspan was Chairman, but have since become more common).
Central banks may have been independent vis-à-vis their countries’ governments, but internally it was very difficult to stray from the party line.
Another post, published in July, explicitly challenged the BoE’s “official” view that as the economy recovers, we can expect non-financial companies to begin to run down their cash balances to fund investment.
Unfortunately, today’s debates about banking reform have just this character.
Yes, the principle of regulating bank capital seems sensible.
A typical bank exam would include scrutiny of every single business loan and a large proportion of consumer loans.
Limits on borrowing that make it difficult to earn an adequate return on equity encourage banks to load up on riskier, high-profit-margin loans – and requiring banks to hold more capital for supposedly riskier categories of assets exacerbates the problem.
We can no longer afford to rely on old-fashioned examination for mega-banks loaded with mass-produced risks.
With the onset of the European sovereign-debt crisis in 2010, banks’ appetite for public debt fell again.
Of course, integrated financial markets also benefit banks’ clients by enabling institutions to provide broader and higher-quality financial services at lower prices.
But regulation could change that.
CHICAGO – The biggest financial nightmare looming over the world economy is the insolvency of a large international bank.
This institution should be an international version of the US Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code.
Takeover by an international organization has three advantages over a domestic solution.
First, rigid rules that wipe out shareholders and penalize long-term creditors are a clear deterrent from bankers’ point of view.
Bank of America performed poorly on the US Federal Reserve’s financial stress tests, and regulators criticized Goldman Sachs’ and JPMorgan Chase’s financing plans, leading both to lower their planned dividends and share buybacks.
New studies, including important ones from the International Monetary Fund and the US Government Accountability Office, do indeed show that the long-term boost afforded to too-big-to-fail banks like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America is declining from its pre-crisis high. This is good news.
The banks know that they will receive more business if they run their trading desks from the part of their corporate group that has the strongest government backing.
So, in 2006, a revised version of the law was enacted, marking an important milestone in China’s efforts to build an effective legal system as it moves towards a market economy.
In order for this part of the law to go ahead, the Supreme People’s Court issued judicial interpretations that set out who can be designated a company receiver and the amount and type of compensation they can be paid.
How can an enterprise being restructured, say, find a way to issue securities for financing if it cannot meet conventional standards such as profitability and net asset value, as required by the Company Law and the Securities Law? The law must contain specific provisions regarding such matters in order to ensure successful listing of restructuring firms.
The aftermath of the banking crisis requires thinking about not only the most appropriate form of banking legislation, but also the appropriate size of the state.
Second, it lends itself much more effectively to long-term strategic thinking about the overall direction of the national, or even the international, economy.
There was a competitive race across the Atlantic and – to a lesser extent – the Pacific.
When the strategy goes wrong, the recriminations begin.
Following the Six-Day War, Israel did not consider the conquered lands as something to be traded for peace, and thus induce the Arab world and the Palestinians to recognize its legitimacy and ensure the demilitarization of Palestinian territories after their restitution.
Indeed, a substantial number of them don’t even recognize the Israeli state’s legal authority.
But, despite past US administrations’ opportunity to make their influence felt, they preferred to permit Israel, an allied, friendly state, to do what it wanted.
An article in The Far Eastern Economic Review proclaims that “Wall Street’s crack-up presages a global tectonic shift: the beginning of the decline of American power.”
Crises often refute conventional wisdom, and this one reveals that the underlying strength of the American economy remains impressive.
It also includes new challenges like pandemics and climate change.
In 2001, a non-state group killed more Americans than the government of Japan killed at Pearl Harbor.
Fortunately, Barack Obama understands that.
The silent majority is ready to be convinced that there is life after Bush.
In fact, African-Americans do not fully support him.
The world needs a more modest and confident America.
In the same vein, Obama’s pledge to “renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crises abroad” was hailed as another telling sign that Obama’s views coincide with Europe’s.
The hard truth is that the US remains reluctant to trade its sovereignty for multilateral solutions.
Obama’s silence with regard to multilateral efforts to combat global warming is notable.
Of course, Russian diplomacy has performed extremely well recently, but it does not stand on its own merits alone.
Carter was a somewhat bland engineer, whereas Obama is a charismatic lawyer.
The agreement on Syria’s chemical weapons struck by Russia and the US could one day be remembered as a spectacular breakthrough in the field of arms control.
“My fellow Americans, the Founders had the wisdom to guarantee our freedoms in many ways.
“Third, we must have a special prosecutor to prosecute the culpable.
So half of incoming American college students don’t know what our democracy is, let alone how to defend it when it is threatened.
That means not only recognizing the vital link between his policies and today’s problems, but also ensuring that what should be preserved is not sacrificed in the rush to efface his memory.
Moreover, instead of eliminating Qaddafi’s highly politicized judicial system – for example, separate courts, administered by the revolutionary committees, could try any Libyan without due process – his successors have embraced it.
Qaddafi thus took the first step – intentional or not – toward creating a modern nation-state.
Libya’s leaders – and their Western benefactors – have no choice but to consider and address the effects of Qaddafi’s legacy on public attitudes and official behavior.
But despite restrictions, by 2005 Germany had absorbed 37% of all migrants from Eastern Europe that came before and after eastern EU enlargement, whereas Italy had absorbed 22%, Greece 11%, Switzerland 8%, and the UK only 3%.
As migrants move between markets with well-defined property rights, immigration in principle is beneficial for both the immigrants and the target country.
In Italy, the share is just 11% – the lowest in the available statistics.
This may reflect the high interchange in both directions between the Anglo-Saxon countries, or replacement migration in which skilled people arrive from elsewhere as the domestic skilled migrate to other Anglo-Saxon countries.
If their export revenues were to plunge relative to their debt-service obligations, the result could be crises reminiscent of Latin America’s in 1982 or the Asian and Russian currency crises of 1997-1998.
So, why has it not been tried before? When one asks finance ministers in commodity-exporting debtor countries, they frequently reply that they fear insufficient demand for commodity bonds.
Instead of denominating a loan to Nigeria in terms of dollars, the Bank would denominate it in terms of the price of oil and lay off its exposure to the world oil price by issuing that same quantity of bonds denominated in oil.
The World Bank should take up the cause.
The perceived lack of leadership from the Commission at this time of deepening economic gloom is just the tip of the iceberg.
But the bottom line is that at a time when everyone is asking, “What is Europe doing?”, the Commission’s responses have seemed inadequate.
EU governments have wanted a pliable Commission, but now the cost could be the death of the “community method” that protects the EU against national frictions.
There is no question that the crisis left the country unable to service its debts.
The vultures showed no scruples in profiting at the expense of Argentine taxpayers.
As for borrowing in European currencies, Griesa was quick to declare that his rulings would cover such bonds as well.
Why didn’t it happen sooner? The answer is that getting investors to agree is like herding cats.
Both announcements were greeted with great acclaim.
Thus, by permitting two clearing banks to access renminbi onshore, Chinese officials are effectively subsidizing their London and Frankfurt operations and encouraging direct sterling and euro trades.
Thus, the decision to designate renminbi clearing banks in London and Frankfurt is, in effect, one more step by China to foster the emergence of an international monetary system with several global currencies, not just one.
In the past, demand for such assets has been fed by the expectation that the renminbi will continue to appreciate.
The question is whether Stein’s new view is justified.
That leaves the question of how to detect the existence of excesses, and the question of what, exactly, to do about them.
Inevitably, the answers are colored by the United States’ experience in 1929, when the Fed tightened policy in response to what it perceived as excesses on Wall Street, only to plunge the economy into the Great Depression.
The implication is clear: Central banks should focus on developing more effective macro-prudential instruments.
And the United States has displayed no willingness to renounce its anachronistic privilege of nominating the World Bank’s president.
Moreover, there already is a proliferation of regional development banks, from the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank to the more modestly capitalized African Development Bank.
But the other members will hesitate to lend more than token amounts, especially if there are repayment doubts.
So much, then, for the CRA as an alternative to the IMF. And, if inclusion of that provision was not revealing enough, then there is the fact that the BRICS’ commitments to the CRA are expressed in US dollars.
There are still a few countries with worrisomely large surpluses and deficits.
Financing for America’s current-account deficit would dry up.
The renminbi, meanwhile, strengthened, reflecting Chinese residents’ increased desire to consume.
But will there be a next time? A couple of years ago, forecasters were confident that global imbalances would reemerge once the crisis passed.
TOKYO – As the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convenes in Beijing, China stands at a crossroads.
They also appreciate the need to build a social safety net and strengthen rural property rights.
Just as Chinese industrialization is unprecedented – no developing country has grown by more than 10% per year without interruption for two full decades – Britain’s industrialization 200 years ago was similarly unparalleled.
In the face of considerable controversy, assistance continued to be provided without requiring the poor to enter oppressive workhouses.
China may regard the nineteenth-century experience of a windswept island off the northwest coast of Europe as an odd source of inspiration.
In 1834, the Speenhamland system was replaced by the New Poor Law, which confined relief to workhouses, under conditions sufficiently odious to force people back into the labor market.
Or, to put it another way: the market-clearing wage was unable to provide a living income for 38% of working families.
After all, one prediction on which we can confidently rely is that automation will make increasingly large inroads into the world of human work.
But the idea has always fallen foul of two objections: societies are too poor to afford it, and it would be a disincentive to work.
Indeed, as industrial production migrates to East Asia and innovation remains in North America, Europe risks losing its position in the most attractive international markets.
Russians accuse Europeans of taking too long to liberalize visas, blocking Russian energy companies’ access to Europe’s downstream markets, instigating anti-Russian sentiment in the post–Soviet era, and trying to interfere in Russia’s domestic politics.
But curtailing social programs in both Europe and Russia would jeopardize human capital, their most valuable comparative advantage.
Likewise, launching initial public offerings on European stock exchanges has strengthened Russian corporations’ governance, social responsibility, and treatment of minority shareholders.
He was accustomed to good fortune, for his huntsmen took precautions.
Just as the glory of the French Revolution ended in the Terror, so Eastern Europe’s miracle year of 1989 ended in blood.
The rest is well-known history.
Everyone on the square and everyone watching on national TV saw clearly. The emperor had no clothes.
I could understand the poets, students, dissidents, and allegedly disaffected government officials.
Beating the Drug-War Addiction
And, with the US continuing to be the world’s largest market for illegal drugs, its leaders’ focus on the drug war in Latin America does not appear misguided, at least not on the surface.
South America’s southern cone – especially Argentina and Chile – has not been immune to the vast expansion of organized crime, money laundering, and demand for narcotics elsewhere in the region.
Strong global demand, owing to emerging economies like China, has undoubtedly fueled some of the price increase.
Moreover, it is relatively easy to postpone lowering oil consumption.
The root problem is that financial markets can now mobilize tens of billions of dollars for speculative purposes.
Given lack of storage capacity, this could quickly lower prices and burn speculators.
So, one reason countries do not like capital inflows is that it means more domestic demand “leaks” outside.
Unfortunately, though, so long as some countries like China, Germany, Japan, and the oil exporters pump surplus goods into the world economy, not all countries can trim their spending to stay within their means.
All this creates distortions that delay adjustment – exchange rates are too low in emerging markets, slowing their move away from exports, while the ease with which the US government is being financed creates little incentive for US politicians to reduce spending over the medium term.
India’s willingness to spend when everyone else is attempting to sell and save entails risks that need to be carefully managed.
The wall of money unleashed by the ECB just before Christmas should be seen as a measure matching that commitment.
Sooner or later, the banks will use the cash.
This should not come as a surprise.
Most new revelations about Pakistan's nuclear scandal focus on the clandestine supply of uranium enrichment technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya by the celebrated bomb-maker Dr. A. Q. Khan.
Dr. Khan's televised confession and acceptance of sole responsibility for proliferation activities has done nothing to reduced suspicion that there is more here than meets the eye, and of the Pakistani military's complicity in proliferation.
Yet his public confession and apology are unlikely to end the matter.
Imagine, for example, the horrific situation consequences ofarising from an atomic explosion in some American city.
BEIJING – In a few weeks, Beijing will implement a city-wide ban on smoking in all indoor public spaces, such as restaurants and offices, as well as on tobacco advertising outdoors, on public transportation, and in most forms of media.
But they have done little to reduce smoking, owing not only to weak enforcement, but also to the prevailing view, held by 75% of Chinese adults, that smoking does not cause serious harm.
Given that e-cigarettes merely heat a nicotine solution to produce an inhalable vapor, they release none of the carcinogenic tar of cigarette smoke, making them the ideal nicotine-delivery system for smokers seeking – or being forced – to reduce or halt their tobacco intake.
As Huang explains, if more officials turn to e-cigarettes, ordinary people might be inspired to follow suit.
Indeed, some 70% of all Hong Kong-listed companies have a Caribbean registry, and even a number of major mainland companies, including the Internet giant Alibaba, are registered in offshore tax havens.
He long touted the motto, “I don’t do anything against China’s interest, and I don’t say anything that may hurt China’s reputation.”
Unlike most of Hong Kong’s tycoons, who are considered excessively focused on political expedience, Li is viewed as a person of strong conscience and thus worthy of considerable respect.
Li, an avid reader of world history and literature, has apparently not taken to heart the lesson that so many Chinese have learned, through great personal tragedies, since 1949.
Finally, Bernanke claimed that “the growth fundamentals of the United States do not appear to have been permanently altered by the shocks of the past four years.”
As a result, the Depression did not cast a shadow on future growth – or, rather, the shadow was overwhelmed by the blinding floodlights of five years of mobilization for total war against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.
As a result, America would not just end this episode 3% poorer than it might have been; the gap would grow – to 7% by 2035 and 11% by 2055.
For the Kenyan authorities, it was the final straw after a series of abductions of Westerners by al-Shabaab; to stop the incursions, they launched what military leaders believed would be a quick campaign.
Beyond preventing Somalia’s violence from spilling over into Kenya and undermining its security and its tourist-driven economy, such a buffer state could be forced to absorb the half-million Somali refugees who now live in Dadaab’s refugee camps.
In fact, Kenya-backed Jubaland forces clashed with Somali government troops in Kismayo earlier this year.
Two recent events demonstrate what is at stake.
After all, the only conflict so far in which authorities have lost control of sensitive nuclear materials was the Georgia-Abkhazia War in the 1990s, when unknown forces seized a small amount of highly enriched uranium from a research institute.
In the event of the regime’s collapse – a distinct possibility – it would be difficult to prevent the diversion of its assets, or even the use of its weapons.
Instead of waiting for a major development to force hurried action, the world’s major powers should engage in a full-throated debate to determine the best approach to address nuclear risks in volatile countries, seeking ways to cooperate whenever necessary.
This naturally prompts questions about whether Iran is using the current round of negotiations as a façade for an ongoing effort to develop nuclear weapons.
Likewise, in January 2006, following the collapse of negotiations with European emissaries, Iran broke the IAEA seals on the Natanz facility’s equipment and storage areas.
On December 19, 2003, Libya formally renounced all WMD efforts.
And, given the stakes, any international agreement with Iran must come with an assured response to cheating, including military action.
Another defining event in 1989 was the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy protestors in Beijing.
More broadly, the emblematic defeat of Marxism in 1989 allowed Asian countries, including China and India, to pursue capitalist policies overtly.
Of course, not all post-1989 developments were positive.
And the subsequent “color revolutions” in places like Ukraine only instilled greater caution among the surviving authoritarian regimes, prompting them to implement measures to counter foreign-inspired democratization initiatives.
In September 2009, The Guardian published an article about a company, Quinta Communications SA, owned by a Tunisian-born entrepreneur and long-time business associate of Berlusconi, Tarak Ben Ammar.
They express concern at the “frequently non-transparent” business dealings between the two countries, and allege that many of Berlusconi’s “business cronies” are deeply involved in Russia’s energy strategy.
Beneath a map of Cold War Europe, the then-entrepreneur boasts about the successes of his companies.
To enhance the credibility of public finances, Monti’s government substantially increased taxes, particularly on real estate, while preserving the already record-high income-tax rate.
The real battle, therefore, is between the Bersani and Berlusconi coalitions.
Italians already shoulder heavy taxes: an individual taxpayer with annual income of €50,000 pays €15,000 in income tax; with two children, that total drops by only €1,000.
More broadly, the outcome of Italy’s election will undoubtedly have a far-reaching impact on a still-fragile eurozone, though the nature of that impact remains impossible to predict – unless Berlusconi returns to power, in which case the consequences will be all too clear.
Critics insist that QE is the beginning of the end of the global financial system, if not of civilization itself.
It does not want to rush, because the US economy is still weak, with first-quarter growth a lackluster 1.8%.
However, perhaps not wanting to cause problems for his foreign counterparts, Bernanke took a more cautious approach, merely defending the Fed’s policy as the right choice for America.
But his response to its aftermath was unexpectedly disappointing.
So what went wrong? The answer, as is often the case, depends on which economist you ask.
They argue that there is little evidence that monetary policy will ever restore full prosperity.
Those are words worth considering the next time we find ourselves needing the courage to act.
Capital flight, interest-rate spikes, declining private investment, and a collapse in the value of the dollar – all of these are likely should financial markets lose confidence in a Fed chairman.
He has already guided the Fed through two very tumultuous years with only one major mistake – the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
As conceived in Islamic political thought, a caliphate, unlike a conventional nation-state, is not subject to fixed borders.
A fairly enigmatic figure, he has a higher degree in Islamic studies, and is a gifted strategist and orator.
The second factor is the Islamic State’s ability to secure sufficient support.
बीजिंग. लगभग 10 करोड़ चीनी घोर गरीबी में जीवन यापन करते हैं और मोटे तौर पर साढ़े 27 करोड़ आबादी रोजाना 2 डालर से कम खर्च कर पाती है. चीन में गरीब लोगों की ज्यादातर आबादी देहाती इलाकों में रहती है. इस उम्मीद में कि शहरों में अच्छे वेतन वाले काम पाना आसान है. गरीबों का शहरों की ओर पलायन जारी है कि शहरों में उनका जीवन बेहतर हो जाएगा. वस्तुतः पिछले करीब साढ़े तीन दशक से लगभग 50 करोड़ चीनी आबादी शहरों में आकर बस गई है. इससे जहां 1980 के दशक चीन की कुल आबादी में शहरी आबादी की तादाद 20 प्रतिशत से भी कम थी वहीं अब यह लगभग आधी, यानी 50 फीसद हो गई है.
चीन के प्राधिकारियों को इस समस्या का आभास है. इसलिए उन्होंने नए ‘जनोन्मुखि’ शहरीकरण मॉडल की शुरूआत की है जो ज्यादा कारगर, समावर्ती और प्रर्यावरण की दृष्टि से ज्यादा निर्वहनीय होगा. हाल ही में विश्व बैंक और चीन की राज्य परिषद् के विकास अनुसंधान केंद्र द्वारा जारी संयुक्त रिपोर्ट में बताया गया है कि इस योजना को अमली जामा कैसे पहनाया जाएगा. इसके सफलतापूर्वक किर्यान्वयन से चीन के शहरीकरण के अगले दौर में निश्चित ही गरीबों की जिंदगी में काफी सुधार आएगा.


वास्तव में, उभरती अर्थव्यवस्थाओं में आधारिक संरचना निवेश के वित्तपोषण में मुख्य चुनौती यह है कि बहुत से वाणिज्य बैंक (मुख्यतः यूरोपीय) जिनकी पहले उल्लेखनीय उपस्थिति थी अब पीछे हट गए हैं – और जब तक वे अपने संकटग्रस्त तुलन-पत्रों को दुरुस्त करके कठोर विनियामक मा���कों को पूरा न कर लें, उनके वापस आने की संभावना नहीं है।
और आज के आर्थिक वातावरण में निजी वित्त को आकर्षित करना अनिवार्य है क्योंकि ऐसा कोई और आसान तरीका नहीं है जिससे सार्वजनिक निधियों से आधारिक संरचना के अंतराल को भरा जा सके। ऐसा करने के लिए उचित नियंत्रण, पूर्वानुमेय मूल्य संरचनाओं और एक विश्वसनीय विनियामक वातावरण को सुनिश्चित करना भी आवश्यक होगा।
The Copenhagen Consensus Center, of which I am director, recently asked 60 teams of economists to evaluate the benefits and costs of these proposed targets, which will come into force to replace the Millennium Development Goals in September.
When these factors are weighed against the benefits in monetary terms, each dollar spent ending extreme poverty with cash transfers would achieve about $5 worth of social value.
Such migration would also be good for the developing countries, because migrant workers send home remittances.
For every dollar spent, mostly to pay off Western farmers blocking the current negotiations, the world would achieve more than $2,000 of benefits, making free trade a phenomenal investment.
Will the inexorable rise in medical costs around the world someday pose a major challenge to contemporary capitalism? I submit that in the not-so-distant future, moral, social, and political support for capitalism will be severely tested as would-be egalitarian health systems face ever-rising costs.
But as health expenses start taking up a third of national income, healthcare socialism starts becoming just plain Marxism: to each according to his needs.
Some drug researchers predict that with continuing advances in understanding the human genome, doctors may eventually be able to predict illnesses 15-20 years in advance, and begin prophylactic treatment immediately.
Ultimately, the evidence suggests that societies spend ever-larger fractions of their income on health over time, in contrast to food expenditures, for example, which fall as countries become wealthier.
My recent study with Jacopo Carmassi, Time to Set Banking Regulation Right, shows that by permitting excessive leverage and risk-taking by large international banks – in some cases allowing banks to accumulate total liabilities up to 40, or even 50, times their equity capital – the Basel banking rules not only enabled, but, ironically, intensified the crisis.
In order to overcome these shortcomings in international banking regulations, three remedies are needed.
There would also be no need for special restrictions on banking activities and operations.
But this does not guarantee that future drops will have a similar outcome. On the contrary, the future real value of our homes is fundamentally uncertain.
But the tools needed to hedge such risks should be made available to everyone.
For example, the derivative markets should create an environment that encourages insurers to develop home equity insurance, which insures homeowners not just against a bust but also against drops in the market value of the home.
They will be able to leave the game of real estate speculation to professionals and rest assured about the value that they have accumulated in their homes.
This enormous subsidy to American taxpayers is, in many ways, the world’s largest foreign aid program.
Overall, after almost 25 years of stunning prosperity, punctuated by only two mild recessions, most Americans feel pretty confident about their economic situation.
Of course, it takes two to tango.
Nuclear terrorism, a slowdown in China, or a sharp escalation of violence in the Middle East could all blow the lid off the current economic dynamic.
In Latin America, for example, some 60% of all FDI regulatory changes in 2007 were unfavorable to foreign investors.
For some countries, like the United States, this reevaluation is grounded in national security concerns (largely undefined) that arose in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
While this is certainly not the dominant approach toward FDI, we need to be vigilant that it does not become so.
The new US Congress is looking for scapegoats for the country’s economic quagmire.
Somehow, they must find ways to help the US expand its exports.
Even in cases where its rhetoric has sent mixed messages, US policies have been decidedly liberal.
Unemployment in the US is high, while fiscal and monetary policies have been stretched to their limits.
At the Fukushima site, the backup power supply, essential for maintaining vital safety functions such as cooling the reactors and spent fuel rods, was not properly protected.
What, exactly, has changed? Perhaps most importantly, the worst-case assumptions for safety planning have been radically revised.
The International Atomic Energy Agency expects at least 90 additional nuclear-power reactors to join the 437 now in operation globally by 2030.
New reactors being built today incorporate significantly enhanced safety features, both active and passive, compared to the Fukushima generation of reactors.
Nowadays, the impact of disease in one country is ultimately felt by all.
Around the world, one woman dies every minute in childbirth.
During past recessions, especially in developing economies, the best care has tended to go to the wealthy; the poor, too often, have been left to fend for themselves.
In Africa, the ratio is 900 per 100,000.
Yes, the world faces its first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years.
That seems to be the case in Ukraine today, as its people prepare to vote for a new parliament little more than a year after their successful Orange Revolution.
This "inevitable" process poisoned political life and the media, which led to a strange state of limited freedom and a mafia-like environment.
Some of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statements seem to recall the Soviet era with nostalgia.
But in principle, Ukraine can succeed as well.
COPENHAGEN – At its heart, much of the debate over climate change deals with just one divisive and vexing question: How big should cuts in carbon emissions be?
All the academic models show that, even if possible, limiting the increase in global temperature to 2oC, as promised by the European Union and the G-8, would cost a phenomenal 12.9% of GDP by the end of the century.
One of these is protecting forests, since deforestation accounts for 17% of emissions.
It can be eliminated with cleaner fuels and new cooking technologies.
Beyond the Death Penalty Debate
First, in a modern democracy, punishment must be not only retributive, but should also try to rehabilitate the criminal in order to enable him to live in society with other human beings.
Other criminologists argue that this finding, if well-founded, should then apply to any criminal law: every day, criminal prohibitions are infringed; yet if we did not have such prohibitions, crimes would be even more rampant.
Nowadays, it is associations such as Amnesty International and Hands Off Cain that push states to abolish capital punishment.
But Israel’s government, using all kinds of pretexts, stubbornly resisted.
But even skeptics nourish many hopes.
Above all, we must assure that the armistice has its own dynamic.
Instead, countries with a strong climate-policy agenda should advocate dynamic formulas for setting targets.
Climate science assumes that the global emissions peak must occur within the next several years.
Even if this objective were to be initially linked with a broadly defined timescale, it would establish the standard for action according to which all countries would have to be measured.
This question stands out in view of Chinese public opinion in the latter phase of the Tibet crisis.
And when one looks more closely at how Chinese responded, both to the unrest in Tibet and the Sichuan earthquake, one sees tangible signs that the Chinese are embracing a greater degree of free speech.
Many, indeed, tried to present to the outside world their own version of the Tibet story, rebutting the orthodox narrative – be it Chinese or Western – and posting comments and footage on YouTube and the BBC's bulletin board.
Admittedly, the fierce popular backlash against Western media was partially motivated by nationalist ardor, which played into the government’s hands.
To Google’s credit, if you Google that sentence, you can find reference to a debate on that claim that I took part in recently.
Google doesn’t merely point users to existing information on the Web; it also collects information that it doesn’t share about its users’ behavior.
So, rather than suppressing or regulating the information that Google uncovers, we are better off making it more freely available.
With Google, people start to expect answers about everything .
But it has little coercive power, because anyone is free to try an alternative.
In his book The Blue Nile, Alan Moorehead described the expedition thus: “It proceeds first to last with the decorum and heavy inevitability of a Victorian state banquet, complete with ponderous speeches.”
So, if massive use of force fails, how is a big country, believing that its interests or moral duty compel it to intervene in the affairs of a small one, to do so successfully?
Colonel Mathieu is the unsung hero of current counter-insurgency orthodoxy, which requires a minimum military presence in the target country, mainly of intelligence agencies like the CIA and “special forces.”
The United Nations Convention on Torture explicitly forbids “cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,” so their use must be denied.
We are being driven slowly but ineluctably to the realization that the people whom we are fighting will, to a significant extent, inherit the shattered countries that we leave behind.
The trouble lies in the fact that many of the leading indicators used to measure the economy rely on out-of-date, incomplete, or flawed data.
The Billion Prices Project at MIT measures inflation using real-time data on online purchases from hundreds of retailers globally.
The Fed may have blundered in releasing its data ahead of schedule.
Some argue that the solution is to return to the simpler economic models of the past, which yielded policy prescriptions that evidently sufficed to prevent comparable crises.
In fact, largely unbeknownst to the protagonists in this debate over models, an evidentiary revolution is already underway.
In fact, economic history never stopped playing its role in economic research.
These developments amount to a sea change in economics.
At a time when poverty threatens to overtake hundreds of millions of people, especially in the least developed parts of the world, we need the promise of prosperity.
The good news is that we are awakening to this reality.
I think of it as seed money for a wholesale reconfiguration of global industry.
In today’s crisis lies tomorrow’s opportunity – economic opportunity, measured in jobs and growth.
Again, a solution to poverty is also a solution for climate change: green growth.
Costa Rica in Central America and Mauritius in Africa each pulled ahead of its regional peers some time ago.
Singapore achieved rich-country status with a unique development strategy.
First, there was the specific policy idea of making poverty benefits contingent on children’s school attendance (an idea which has been embraced even in New York City).
Big Money Merges with Big Brother
You see, they were using Microsoft-equipped computers and could not prove that the software had not been pirated.
In 2005, Yahoo gave the Chinese police the computer identification code for a dissident journalist, Shi Tao. Shi Tao had sent a message in praise of democracy, which the censors had detected.
Google’s move seemed to reconcile its proclaimed libertarian philosophy with its business ethics.
Internet companies may, more than most, hide their true motives behind ersatz, democratic-sounding slogans, but in the end they are advertising products like any other.
BRUSSELS – France, which now holds the presidency of the G-20, has chosen reform of the international monetary system as its main priority for the Cannes summit in November.
Rather, it has taken topics one at a time, seeking to reach consensus separately on each: the completion of efforts undertaken by the 2010 South Korean presidency to strengthen multilateral liquidity-provision schemes; the strengthening of multilateral surveillance; the appropriate use of capital controls; and a change in the composition of the basket of currencies that comprise the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights, a unit of account that was once expected to evolve into a global store of value.
The main economic and currency blocs clearly do not meet such preconditions today, albeit for different reasons.
This is perhaps unavoidable, because leaders must focus on what they can actually deliver.
This instability has raised fears of emerging-market contagion, with South Africa especially susceptible, owing to its capital-account openness.
Then, last May, the US Federal Reserve announced its intention to begin to “taper” its multi-trillion-dollar asset-purchase program – so-called “quantitative easing” – triggering large-scale capital flight from emerging markets.




In the French newspaper Le Monde, a highly intelligent commemorative supplement dubbed the period “The Decade of Bin Laden.”
Indeed, the notion of a “war on terror” in reply was misguided in part because it allowed people to think that Al Qaeda was just another terrorist group like the IRA, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, or the Red Brigades.
The Taliban, who demanded to be left alone in exchange for staying out of politics, were driven into Pakistan, where they reconvened.
As the Arab Spring has shown, the ubiquity of information means that future coalitions need to be formed at the micro level, in the villages and valleys of places like Afghanistan and Pakistan, rather than only at the macro level of managing the global system.
Over the past few centuries, there have been three systems of international order: economic and military domination; a balance of power; and shared sovereignty.
The Price of Biodiversity
So far, a huge number of potential SDG targets have been proposed, some of which relate to biodiversity.
Moreover, forests absorb intense rainfall, thereby reducing the risk of flooding.
Clearly, protecting coral reefs is a much better use of limited resources.
Jika diterapkan dengan baik, biofuel dapat menjadi sarana yang efektif untuk meningkatkan keamanan pangan melalui penyediaan sumber energi berkelanjutan dan terjangkau bagi petani miskin.
Mesin pertama buatan Rudolf Diesel, dirancang pada akhir tahun 1800an, digerakkan oleh bahan bakar yang dihasilkan oleh minyak kacang.
Jika arahan penggunaan biofuel diterapkan selama beberapa tahun, bukan hanya satu tahun, maka pembuat kebijakan dapat mempengaruhi permintaan untuk meminimalisasi tekanan pada harga pangan.
The first diagnosis was cerebral palsy.
But scientists and software engineers regularly face such daunting challenges, and, with DNA serving as the reference language of modern biomedical research, the technical barriers to constructing disease networks will be short-lived.
And that could prove to be even more difficult, because the current closed nature of the medical-information system and its self-directed incentive structure block such sharing.
We can provide our genetic samples to data-driven trials to learn about our likelihood to respond to particular therapies. We can even organize to self-fund future studies or join only those studies that give us the legal right to say how and where our data are used.
इस प्रोटीन की संरचना और क्रियात्‍मक गुण वही होते हैं जो कुदरती तौर पर स्‍तन के दूध में पाए जाते हैं, और इनका निष्‍कर्षण ठीक वैसे ही किया जाता है जैसे सामान्‍य तौर पर बैक्‍टीरिया और खमीर जैसे जीवों से औषधिवाले प्रोटीनों का निष्‍कर्षण करने के लिए किया जाता है। पेरू में किए गए एक अनुसंधान से पता चला है कि वेंट्रिया के धान निष्‍कर्षित प्रोटीनों से युक्त पुनर्जलीकरण घोल की मौखिक खुराक दस्तों की अवधि को घटाती है और इनकी पुनरावृत्ति की दर को कम करती है - यह लाभ विकासशील देशों के लोगों के लिए चमत्‍कार के समान है।

Trade-offs also pervade environmental policy: Cutting more of one pollutant, for example, leaves fewer resources to address other issues.
Meanwhile, the annual per capita environmental cost is $318.
As the South African finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, explained, “to sustain the growth rates we need to create jobs, we have no choice but to build new generating capacity – relying on what, for now, remains our most abundant and affordable energy source: coal.” The US government even acknowledged that, without a coal-fired power plant, South Africa’s “economic recovery will suffer, adversely impacting electrification, job creation, and social indicators.”
According to a recent World Bank study, distributed renewable energy “will be the lowest cost option for a minority of households in Africa, even when likely cost reductions over the next 20 years are considered.”
Al Gore’s climate adviser, James Hansen, argues that if we allow developing countries to “come up to the level of the developed world, then the planet is done for.”
When we do, they feel like a guilty pleasure.
So it is worth stepping back and recognizing that many indicators point to a world that is improving.
Today, the average South Korean has 12 years of education, whereas the average Pakistani has fewer than six.
The good news, which is not often publicized (precisely because it is good), is that scenarios in which military spending is higher, the same, or lower in the future suggest that the high military costs of the twentieth century have been turned into what looks like a permanent peace dividend.
And we do need to focus on eliminating poverty, stamping out illiteracy, and promoting peace.
Both Annan and Gurría cited Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines last November as evidence of increased climate-change-related damage. Never mind that the latest report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that “current datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century” and reported “low confidence” that any changes in hurricanes in recent (or future) decades had anything to do with global warming.
In the real world, China accounts for almost 60% of the global increase in coal consumption from 2012 to 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. While Figueres lauds China for dramatically increasing its solar-power capacity in 2013, the increase in China’s reliance on coal power was 27 times greater.
COPENHAGEN – Despite gains in life expectancy, expanded access to education, and lower rates of poverty and hunger, the world has a long way to go to improve the quality of people’s lives. Almost a billion people still go to bed hungry, 1.2 billion live in extreme poverty, 2.6 billion lack access to clean drinking water and sanitation, and almost three billion burn harmful materials inside their homes to keep warm.
While outdoor air pollution is partly caused by incipient industrialization, this represents a temporary tradeoff for the poor – escaping hunger, infectious disease, and indoor air pollution to be better able to afford food, health care, and education. When countries become sufficiently rich, they can afford cleaner technology and begin to enact environmental legislation to reduce outdoor air pollution, as we now see in Mexico City and Santiago, Chile.
A large part of this is through renewable power like wind, hydro, and solar. For example, Japan recently granted $300 million of its development aid to subsidize solar and wind power in India.
But, as many other well-meaning cities and countries have discovered, cutting CO2 significantly is more difficult than it seems, and may require quite a bit of creative accounting.
With a combined output of 360 megawatts, which will feed electricity into the grid, these turbines will more than cover Copenhagen’s electricity needs – and the surplus can be used to offset the city’s remaining CO2 emissions, including from the city’s millions of non-electric cars.
And Copenhagen is not alone in making such assumptions; the United Kingdom’s Department of Energy & Climate Change estimates a 51% price increase by 2030.
Even if fossil-fuel-powered electricity prices remain constant, Copenhagen’s wind turbines become a net drain.
But the benefits to the entire world would be much lower.
The EU did not just implement a single carbon market in order to meet its target for CO2 emissions. Instead, the EU made a bad deal a lot costlier through a host of partly contradictory policies.
Biofuels are even less efficient, costing more than $300 per ton of CO2 avoided, while doing just over one cent of good per dollar.
Finally, the negative effects of poor climate policies are not just financial.
With these questions in mind, the Copenhagen Consensus (which I direct) asked some of the world’s top economists to assess the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of many different targets.
Of course, the precise return on investment in expanded preschool education is difficult to discern. But, in order to prioritize development targets – within and outside of the realm of education – estimates must be made.
A better approach would be to introduce tuition fees for the wealthy and scholarships for the poor.
Biofuels were subsidized by another $19 billion, with essentially no climate benefit. All of that money could have been used to improve health care, hire more teachers, build better roads, or lower taxes.
In Germany, where green subsidies will cost €23.6 billion this year, household electricity prices have increased by 80% since 2000, causing 6.9 million households to live in energy poverty.
Since then, it has powered its explosive economic growth almost exclusively with highly polluting coal, lifting 680 million people out of poverty. Today, China gets a trifling 0.23% of its energy from wind and solar.
If we fail to address it, Kerry says, the costs will be “catastrophic.”
The first installment of the IPCC report showed that there is indeed a climate problem – emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO₂, lead to higher temperatures, which will eventually become a net problem for the world.
The third installment of the IPCC report showed that strong climate policies would be more expensive than claimed as well – costing upwards of 4% of GDP in 2030, 6% in 2050, and 11% by 2100.
The Stern Review was produced by bureaucrats and never subjected to peer review.
And we need to give more attention to all of the other problems.
Is reducing violence a goal worthy of resources that would otherwise be spent on, say, reducing hunger? And, if so, which forms of violence should be targeted?
Based on studies published in Science, 28% of all women in Sub-Saharan Africa reported experiencing violence in the past year at the hands of their partners or family.
Unfortunately, there is still little hard evidence about where resources should best be focused.
(Kiswahili for “Now!”) promotes the view that partner violence is unacceptable, and has helped to halve the rate of it.
Second, there are solutions that can help to tackle some of these problems very cost-effectively.
Using classic economic valuations of everything from lost lives, bad health, and illiteracy to wetlands destruction and increased hurricane damage from global warming, the economists show how much each problem costs. To estimate the magnitude of the problem, it is compared to the total resources available to fix it.
As temperatures rise, however, the costs will rise and the benefits will decline, leading to a dramatic reduction in net benefits. After the year 2070, global warming will become a net cost to the world, justifying cost-effective climate action now and in the decades to come.
While the optimists are not entirely right (loss of biodiversity in the twentieth century probably cost about 1% of GDP per year, with some places losing much more), the overall picture is clear.
The night of November 9, 1989, marked the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union and its empire, and thus also of the bipolar world that had, for five decades, divided Germany and Europe.
But, in fact, by linking the answers to the global climate and economic crises, we can find a way out of both.
So the black swan of the climate crisis is already preparing to land.
When voters in France and the Netherlands turned down the proposal for a Constitution for the European Union, the world knew that the European project was in deep trouble.
In the event, it turned into a three-way battle between Britain, France and the new member states.
This was a message for which Britain’s European friends had long been hoping, and for which they had waited in vain since Blair’s election in 1997.
He wants to be a part of a political Europe; but only if the other member states follow Britain’s model of economic and social reform.
The Constitution, adopted by the 25 member states last year, is not, in itself, a big deal.
If this is Blair’s calculation, he is mistaken.
Not only has he kept Britain out of the single European currency over the past four years, he made it clear during the election campaign that he does not expect the UK to join the Euro during the next five years either.
They will then be forced to make public and explicit choices about the sort of Europe that they want, and this will put them at odds with their neighbors.
Very few among them (notable exceptions including Nouriel Roubini and Robert Shiller) raised alarm bells about the crisis to come.
The fault lies not with economics, but with economists.
Trade economists study the implications of globalization on inequality within and across countries.
Instead of being analysts, they have been ideologues, favoring one set of social arrangements over others.
That thought may lead us to disdain the kind of philanthropic graffiti that leads to donors’ names being prominently displayed on concert halls, art museums, and college buildings.
Perhaps we will eventually reach a tipping point at which giving a significant amount to help the world’s poorest becomes sufficiently widespread to eliminate the majority of those 25,000 needless daily deaths.
Hsieh says that whether or not his giving has saved the lives of others, it has saved his own: “I could easily have lived a life that was boring and inconsequential.
If you earn less than $100,000, you don’t have to give away anything at all, and if you earn, say, $110,000, you would be required to give away only $1,000 – less than 1% of your income.
And this time, the financial mechanisms involved are not highly complex structured financial products, but one of the oldest financial instruments in the world: government bonds.
The sixteenth-century Habsburgs borrowed – at very high interest rates – from Florentine, Genovese, and Augsburg merchants.
That model was transferred to many other countries, and became the bedrock on which modern financial stability was built.
In 2008, on the eve of the financial crisis, three-quarters of Portuguese debt, half of Spanish and Greek debt, and more than 40% of Italian debt was held by foreigners.
Blind in Gaza and Jerusalem
The Quartet’s peacemaker, Tony Blair, is as unctuously nugatory as ever. He appears on CNN , but has he actually visited Gaza since his appointment in the summer of 2007?
These “wise men,” advisers one and all to President Bill Clinton and other presidents, all seem to concede that the failure of the proposed Camp David accord in 2000 could not, after all, be laid solely at Arafat’s door. Former Israeli premier Ehud Barak should carry his share of the blame.
But I have begun to wonder whether it will really be possible to achieve peace on this basis.
However tough things looked in the past, I have never felt such a sense of despair about Palestine and Israel. Reason has been drowned in blood.
People – and their elected leaders as well -- often have the feeling that such seemingly innocent proposals are in fact part of an ominous “hidden agenda.”
First, different manifestations of Islamic piety or culture are seen as alternative ways of expressing the same core meaning.
Indeed, how many times does a critic of European block thought meet this kind of response: “But where are the Muslims who are criticizing extremist Islam?”
I became an avid and diligent e-mailer.
And increasingly, some are viruses that have infected friends’ address books, with attachments that, if opened, could destroy my computer.
Like Eliot, I felt that I understood more when I knew less, and knew more when I had less information to process.
Part of the problem is that we allow ourselves to be persuaded that new inventions will only make our lives more convenient, rather than also adding to our burdens.
So far, it hasn’t made much of a difference: e-mails continue to flood the decommissioned mailbox.
The Ottomans introduced the practice of “judicial royal fratricide,” supposedly to prevent civil war.
Indeed, it may be that the transition from passionate to impersonal politics is one of the most difficult challenges facing democratizers everywhere.
As the two brothers sat on platforms together, challenging each other’s views, they tried to maintain the double fiction that, on the one hand, there was no special bond between them, and, on the other, that their sometimes fierce disagreements did not taint their fraternal affections.
MEXICO – Drug trafficking has existed in Mexico for decades.
He responded by quickly launching a frontal assault on the cartels, with the support of the army.
Nevertheless, public-opinion polls still show broad backing for Calderón’s strategy.
PARIS – Could Europe be a Democratic “blue state” and Asia a Republican “red state”?
But the Chinese, too, may very likely be favoring McCain, for the opposite reason.
It is too early to say that the “yellow man’s burden” is about to replace Rudyard Kipling’s “white man’s burden” in world history.
They do not want the US only to protect them, but to transform them.
Sectors and industry delineations as we know them are breaking down.
Kodak and Nokia, for example, provide a cautionary tale for companies that began life as innovators.
They did not make room around the table for those who could see that the company’s destiny did not lie only straight ahead, but also off to the side.
In a legal case between Apple and A123, a manufacturer of batteries for electric cars, A123 accuses Apple of violating a non-compete agreement that its engineers signed.
The drivers of both the tractor and the metallic-silver luxury car were 45-year-old women, but any similarity between them ended there: the former was a peasant, the latter the wife of a wealthy businessman.
Liu became so angry about being accused of fraud and denied the car that he climbed atop a high advertising billboard and threatened to jump as a show of innocence.
The apathetic response of the dead peasant woman's husband to the $10,000 in compensation he received was telling.
Thanks to his perseverance and the media's investigation, the fraud was laid bare.
With people outside the boardroom increasingly demanding to hold those inside it to account, opening up avenues of communication is now critical to companies’ long-term success.
When activist investors want to take a look at a company, the boardroom instinct should not be to circle the wagons and call in consultants to do battle.
The Age of Bobby Fischer
There were no DVD players or pay-per-view services.
Although most Westerners today pretend that we always knew that Russian-style Communism would fail, it was not so obvious back then.
The American might have been the ultimate chess genius, but the Russian was the class act.
WASHINGTON, DC – Ever since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, media outlets and specialists alike have devoted much attention to anticipating negative shocks to the global economy.
Unlike in 2013, the strategy of Ryan and his allies this time around is unlikely to include a threat to default directly on federal government debt.
So why is it likely to happen?
Nigeria’s Poverty-Powered Insurgency
But, before the government had even announced its decision, Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, rejected the offer. In an audio recording that he sent to journalists earlier this month, he stated that the organization had done nothing to warrant an amnesty.
Bolivia Divided
The conflict is not, as the government claims, between the people and a few oligarchs.
In turn, the most radical regional opposition groups threaten secession if the central government blocks their demands for greater self-government.
In this conflict, both sides have raised their bets, and their threats could become a reality.
While the existence of indigenous movements is a reality in many countries, from Chiapas to “Araucania,” from Amazonia to Ayacucho, nowhere in Latin America have they posed a genuine threat to national integrity.
Caputo and the UN team then convinced Chilean President Ricardo Lagos to take up the initiative and to promote it with several of his colleagues.
The region continues to need that involvement – on time, on message, and on a proper democratic platform, one that is distinct from both traditional US intervention and Latin America’s traditional indifference.
So, for these groups – and for all citizens who worry about climate change – it was inconceivable that a government promoting the most radical environmentalism would plan and implement the highway project. Indeed, as Morales himself put it, the project would be completed “whatever the cost.”
That risk is substantial.
Conceived, perhaps, with the best intentions, the Morales model is giving hope to Bolivia’s poorest; but it will only pave the way for frustrated hopes ­– also nothing new in Bolivia.
Recreating a state-led economy based on natural gas will promote rent-seeking and a lethargic form of corporatism.
This entails abandoning the prevailing dogma that taxes should only be increased when absolutely necessary.
And tax policy must evolve with changing economic circumstances.
Excise taxes may be levied when goods leave a factory or arrive at a port, simplifying measurement, collection, and monitoring, while ensuring coverage and limiting evasion.
With evidence of sudden capital outflows in response to certain tax-policy changes, governments are reluctant to raise income-tax rates – which have fallen sharply since the late 1970’s – or to tax dividend and interest income, for fear of capital flight.
Since he took office in 2001, President George W. Bush has increased America’s regular military budget by 30%, again not taking into account the cost of the wars he launched.
The US economy is probably in recession, clouds are gathering over its pension and health-care systems, and its military budget may not make sense even in strategic terms.
Mike McConnell, America’s Director of National Intelligence, recently admitted to a US Senate panel that al-Qaeda is gaining strength and steadily improving its ability to recruit, train, and even attack the US.
The Japanese 20-year government bond yielded just 0.87% on January 20.
When either inflation or short-term real interest rates went up, long-term rates rose.
The one-year drop in February 1980 came immediately after Paul Volcker took the helm of the Federal Reserve in 1979.
When an event has never occurred, it cannot be predicted with any semblance of confidence.
Because of the boom in housing and stock market prices, US household net wealth increased by around $18 trillion during 1996-2006.
Fourth, and finally, the failure of Lehman Brothers and near failure of the insurance giant AIG, incited a financial panic, in which even healthy firms are unable to obtain short-term bank loans or sell short-term commercial paper.
Many large economies, including China, Germany, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, have very large export surpluses, and so have been lending to the rest of the world (especially to the US) rather than borrowing. 
Draghi reversed the euro’s slide into oblivion by promising potentially unlimited purchases of member governments’ bonds.
The economy contracted in 2012, and wages declined, despite increases in Germany and some northern countries.
As a result, the income of the global elite is growing both rapidly and independently of what is happening in terms of overall output and employment growth.
Nowhere is there a credible plan to limit the concentration of wealth and power, broaden economic gains through strong real-income growth for the poor, and maintain macroeconomic stability.
While unemployment is significantly higher in sectors that were booming before the crisis, such as construction in the United States, it is more widespread, underpinning the view that greater demand is necessary to restore full employment.
The point is that debt-fueled demand emanates from particular households in particular regions for particular goods.
With too many construction workers and too few jewelers, greater demand may result in higher jewelry prices rather than more output.
The only sustainable solution is to allow the supply side to adjust to more normal and sustainable sources of demand – to ease the way for construction workers and autoworkers to retrain for faster-growing industries.
Whether used to store leftovers, keep hospital equipment sterile, or insulate a home, plastics are unmatched for their adaptability, durability, and low cost.
In 1988, the United States Society of Plastics Industry (SPI) developed a coding system in which each kind of resin is labeled with a number, 1-7, to facilitate sorting.
This translates into a higher proportion of plastics in the remnants of shredded end-of-life automobiles – a contaminated mixture of plastics and non-plastics that is usually disposed of through some combination of landfilling, incineration, and secondary recycling.
As a result, in 2010, Japan recycled 72% of PET bottles, compared to roughly 30% in the US and 48% in Europe.
LONDON – Much has changed about official development assistance (ODA) over the last 50 years.
Although Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have achieved the 0.7% target, the global average has actually declined, from 0.5% of GDP in 1960 to 0.3% today.
In a report released last March, the UK’s House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs cited disagreement among experts on the issue, with estimates ranging from a 0.5% boost to annual GDP growth in recipient countries to no effect on growth at all.
A bolder solution would be direct cash transfers to the poor.
After 50 years of inefficiency, it is time to try something new.
Refugees are coming by land as well as sea.
But, given the inability of participating states to control their borders with non-EU countries, Germany and other Schengen members have temporarily reinstated controls.
The EU has an agency called Frontex to coordinate and strengthen national border-control policies.
There may be a reluctance to contemplate this, but there is no choice if Europe is to have a hope of solving the problem.
Borlaug and the Bankers
Soaring food prices before the global financial crisis provided a warning, as does the slowing rate of growth of agricultural productivity.
Neoclassical economic theory, which has dominated in the West for a century, holds that each individual’s compensation reflects his marginal social contribution – what he adds to society.
In such a world, private and social interests often diverge, as we have seen so dramatically in this crisis.
If we lost even one, our world was made immeasurably poorer.
गरीब उधारकर्ता इस तरह के वित्तीय दबाव से बच सकते हैं या नहीं, यह कई कारकों पर निर्भर करेगा। एक तो यह कि क्या वे देय होनेवाले बांडों का भुगतान करने के लिए और अधिक बांड जारी कर पाएँगे। दूसरा यह कि क्या वे धन का निवेश बुद्धिमत्तापूर्वक करेंगे ताकि वे तुरंत चुकौती कर सकें। और यह इस पर भी निर्भर करेगा कि क्या अस्थिर आयों वाले देश, विशेष रूप से प्राकृतिक संसाधनों पर निर्भर करनेवाले देश, आयों के अधिक होने पर धन को अलग रख पाएँगे।


लेकिन PET सड़ता-गलता नहीं है; और हालांकि इसका पुनर्चक्रण हो सकता है, लेकिन आम तौर पर होता नहीं है। परिणामस्वरूप, बोतल-बंद पानी आज प्लास्टिक के कचरे का अकेला सबसे बड़ा स्रोत बन गया है, जिसमें प्रतिवर्ष दसियों अरब बोतलें कचरे में तब्दील होती हैं। संयुक्त राज्य अमरीका में, जहां पिछले साल बिके बोतल-बंद पानी की मात्रा में 2013 की तुलना में 7% की वृद्धि हुई, प्लास्टिक की बनी 80% बोतलें कचरा बन गईं जो भूभराव का दम घोंट रही हैं।

Others – especially managers of financial assets – are becoming increasingly convinced that economists don’t know very much, and that what they do know is of no use to traders like themselves.
As deficits accumulate, the cost of servicing the net international asset position grows.
So, what alternative does the market see? And why is it so different from the possible scenarios that international financial economists see?
But the odds on a soft landing are lengthening with each passing day.
This is disconcertingly reminiscent of the spring – when Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB president, lashed out at a skeptical bond market and declared a Greek default unfathomable.
The ensuing massive bank bailout, plus continued budget deficits and declining nominal GNP, means that Ireland’s debt is ballooning, while its capacity to pay has collapsed.
Moreover, the IMF announced a new financing program called a “Precautionary Credit Line,” which will provide funds more quickly and with even fewer conditions – even to countries without “sound public finance” and “effective financial supervision.”
Creditors could be offered these par bonds, or a shorter-term bond with a higher coupon – but with debt principal marked down.
Akihito’s trip, which came at the height of Japan’s pro-China foreign policy, was followed by increased Japanese aid, investment, and technology transfer, thereby cementing Japan’s role in China’s economic rise.
Japan’s leaders are perhaps counting on the continuity of India’s strategic policies, which would require the Indian government that emerges from next year’s general election to sustain the momentum of cooperation.
And income inequality in Japan ranks among the lowest in Asia.
63-वर्षीय मोदी में अबे के उदार राष्ट्रवाद, बाज़ार-उन्मुख अर्थशास्त्र, और नए एशियावाद की झलक मिलती है, जिसमें परस्पर संबद्ध रणनीतिक साझेदारियों का समूह बनाने के लिए एशियाई लोकतंत्रों के साथ घनिष्ठ संबंध स्थापित करने की इच्छा है।
संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका के साथ संबंधों - जो हाल ही में भारी राजनयिक तनावों और व्यापार विवादों के कारण बिगड़ गए थे - की गति को बहाल करना एक और अहम चुनौती है। लेकिन बाजार-समर्थक आर्थिक नीतियों और रक्षा आधुनिकीकरण के लिए मोदी की प्रतिबद्धता के कारण अमेरिकी कारोबार के लिए नए अवसरों के पैदा होने और द्विपक्षीय संबंधों के कार्यकलाप के नए स्तर तक पहुँचने की संभावना है।
China’s Borderline Belligerence
Even China’s highly lucrative and fast-growing trade with India has not curbed its rising territorial assertiveness.
In short, China used the Panchsheel Treaty to outwit and humiliate India.
Under pressure from an unyielding and revanchist China, India urgently needs to craft a prudent and carefully calibrated counter-strategy.
A just, rules-based global order has long been touted by powerful states as essential for international peace and security.
The ICJ held that America violated international law both by supporting the contras in their insurrection against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua’s harbors.
China’s new ADIZ, while aimed at solidifying its claims to territories held by Japan and South Korea, is similarly provocative, because it extends to areas that China does not control, setting a dangerous precedent in international relations.
Can a wage dispute qualify as a “grave offense” warranting arrest and humiliation? Would the US tolerate similar treatment of one of its consular officers?
Faced with US President Barack Obama’s reluctance to challenge China’s muscle-flexing and territorial ambitions in Asia – reflected in Japan’s recent split with the US over China’s new Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) – an increasingly desperate Abe was compelled to let both countries know that restraint cannot be one-sided.
For its part, the US government openly – and uncharacteristically – criticized Abe’s Yasukuni visit, with its embassy in Japan releasing a statement saying that the US was “disappointed that Japan’s leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan’s neighbors.”
The Obama administration’s contradictory rhetoric – affirming that the US-Japan security treaty covers the Senkakus, while refusing to take a position on the islands’ sovereignty – has not helped.
Arming the Elephant
The value of India’s arms contracts with US firms exceeds that of American military aid to any country except Israel.
The Indian media are doing their part to strengthen the illusion of progress, latching onto the phrase “closest partners” in their acclaim for the agreement.
But Bush’s invasion and occupation of Iraq was so controversial that it fractured the global consensus to fight terror, with the Guantánamo Bay detention center and the rendition and torture of suspects coming to symbolize the war’s excesses.
Just as covert aid to Afghanistan’s anti-Soviet rebels in the 1980s contributed to Al Qaeda’s emergence – something that Hillary Clinton acknowledged when she was Obama’s secretary of state – the help that the US and its allies provided to Syrian insurgents after they emerged in 2011 contributed to the rise of the Islamic State.
It is not difficult to see the risks inherent in flooding the Syrian killing fields with even more and better-armed fighters.
Two key questions are shaping discussions about Afghanistan’s post-2014 trajectory.
While all eight Afghan presidential candidates claim to support the security accord, this may offer little comfort to the US, given that most of the candidates have directly opposed US interests in the past – not to mention that several of them are former or current warlords.
That intervention – together with the US and Saudi governments’ provision of arms to Afghanistan’s anti-Soviet guerrillas through Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency – helped spread militancy and terrorism, which the subsequent US military intervention has kept alive.
But they have also failed to make significant gains, and US plans to cut aid will make progress even more difficult.
The outcome could impact the world – and not only the esoteric world of international finance – for decades to come.
While the rest of the world is sympathetic to Geithner’s ideas, other countries would like to see more fundamental reform.
More fundamentally, the US role at the center of the global financial system gives tremendous power to US courts, regulators, and politicians over global investment throughout the world.
Such changes put pressure on universal banks to abandon riskier investment-bank activities in order to operate more freely.
SAO PAULO – The attempt by Brazil’s government to participate in the international negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program could well be called “A Manual for Candidates to a Permanent Membership of the United Nations Security Council.”
Even so, Lula insisted that he should change his attitude.
At first, Lula minimized the seriousness of the incidents that occurred after Ahmadinejad’s re-election and went so far as to compare them to a dispute between football fanatics.
He added: “Perhaps there is not another one.
Is this lack of emotion about politics, this absence of confrontation between different projects, good or bad? For some analysts, it is good, because it reveals a nation’s political maturity.

And its intensifying political crisis – impeachment proceedings have now been initiated against President Dilma Rousseff for allegedly using irregular accounting maneuvers to disguise the size of the budget deficit – is raising serious questions about who can provide the much-needed treatment.
But domestic politics has made a bad situation much worse; indeed, the biggest obstacle to economic recovery this year came in the form of a massive corruption scandal at the state-owned oil giant Petrobras.
In short, Brazil lacks a credible fiscal and monetary anchor.
But the reality is that helping countries in situations like Brazil’s is an area where global financial institutions like the IMF – which, it should be noted, is more flexible and open today than it was a decade ago – can play a constructive role.
But no candidate has yet advanced a proposal for reform that would reduce the scope for political interference while ensuring greater accountability and promoting financial stability.
But Neves wants de facto, rather than formal, operational autonomy for the BCB.
Price stability should be accompanied by other targets, especially financial stability, but also, possibly, employment.
Institutional clarity on the BCB’s mandate for financial stability and the instruments at its disposal could help Brazil avoid future crises – or at least weather them more effectively.
Rousseff owes her victory to outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the success of his administration.
So the main challenge for the new president will be to continue Lula’s effort to build a new relationship between the public and private sectors – a model capable of combining transparency and proactive measures that neither devolves into centralizing statism nor surrenders to the markets.
Their progress, therefore, depends on real improvement in the quality of an education system that was designed for the Brazil of the past.
In 2007, huge oil deposits were discovered off Brazil’s coast.
First of all, it wants to spread the wealth by pursuing a new model of regional integration through energy and infrastructure.
Indeed, Petrobras is now producing 100,000 barrels a day in both Angola and Nigeria, with the oil marketed locally.
The size of the new oil reserves adds even more weight to Brazil’s growing global influence.
In addition to the risk posed by the “fiscal cliff” in 2013, the main problem remains: the lack of effective counter-cyclical fiscal policies – for example, a public-investment program – to boost economic activity. Instead, the US has placed all of its chips on monetary easing, unleashing what I have called a currency war, in which global investors, chasing higher yields, flood into emerging countries, driving up their exchange rates.
The government’s macroeconomic stabilization efforts, coupled with policies that increased the country’s growth potential, allowed the interest rate to fall over the last decade.
We have launched a program worth more than $60 billion for highway and railway concessions, to be followed by a similar program for ports and airports.
If we act together and pull in the same direction, we all will win.
A 10-year industrial policy program called Pro-álcool was crucial in the development of the industry.
The details of Pro-álcool involved providing incentives to several parties to participate, without which they would have sat on the sidelines.
Some were talented and believed that the new subsidies and incentives rendered long-term investments in the industry highly attractive.
If these lessons are implemented, market forces can pick up where industrial policy leaves off.
At the same time, if the US sets the bar too high at the outset, it will deny itself an effective role in helping to move Burma away from authoritarian rule and into the world community.
These programs produce powerful agents for community development in Burma, and can significantly improve the prospects for better governance.
The US needs to position itself to respond effectively and flexibly to the twists and turns that a potential transition in Burma may take over time, with an eye toward pressing the Burmese leadership to move in positive directions.
Japan has published its proposals for major carbon reductions.
Perhaps the most interesting fact to emerge is that fully 70% of the reductions needed by 2020 can be achieved by investing in three areas: increasing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation, and use of lower-carbon energy sources, including nuclear and renewables.
Renaissance of nuclear power will require a big expansion of qualified scientists and engineers.
While such targets are important, what matters most is agreement on the measures that ultimately will set the world on a new path to a low carbon future.
Rodrik’s thesis is that though there is only one economics, there are many recipes for development success.
The Chicago School claims that real-world market economies produce roughly efficient (so-called “Pareto optimal”) outcomes on which public policy cannot improve.
These differences reflect the intellectual richness of neo-classical economics, but they provide no justification for the claim that there is one economics.
Another reason is that heterodox and MIT School economists also often agree on policy, even if their reasoning is different.
If any abnormalities are found, a diagnostic test is conducted to confirm the presence of the disease.
The second, the Canadian National Breast Screening Study, which began in the 1980s, also used annual mammograms and breast examinations for the screened group. But, in the control group, women aged 50-59 also received annual clinical breast examinations, and women aged 40-49 were given a single breast examination.
Many of the women who believe that their lives were saved by mammography screenings actually had so-called “IDLE” cancers (indolent lesions of epithelial origin), which would not have progressed before they died of other causes. Meanwhile, the very aggressive cancers, which are most likely to prove fatal, tend to present as “interval” cancers that appear between screenings.
But the current frenzied focus is marked by considerable amnesia.
In addition, 50,000 old taxis and 10,000 buses have been replaced, and 4,000 of the new buses are powered by natural gas – now the largest fleet of its kind in the world.
NEW YORK – Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that Geert Wilders, the Dutch politician who is convinced that Europe is “in the final stages of Islamization,” is right: Anders Breivik, the Norwegian mass murderer, is mad.
Speroni claimed that Breivik’s “ideas are in defense of western civilization.”
But, while there was nothing intrinsically wrong with discussing the social consequences of large-scale immigration from Muslim countries, some populists in Holland, Denmark, France, Germany, Belgium, Britain, and other countries, went much further.
LONDON – The Islamic State’s attack in Paris in November was the latest crisis to delay Britain’s bid to renegotiate its membership in the European Union, ahead of a planned referendum on whether to maintain the relationship.
In a November 10 speech at Chatham House, Cameron emphasized the benefits of EU membership for Britain’s national security.
The first demand – for a Europe that enhances “competitiveness” and reduces business regulation – will be the easiest to secure.
One solution would be a double-majority voting system requiring the consent of both euro and non-euro members, like the one adopted during the creation of the eurozone’s banking union.
The Brexit Balance Sheet
The question is whether “Brexit” would be as glorious as its proponents like to imagine.
The Scots would almost certainly want to break away from England and rejoin the EU as an independent member, giving further encouragement (as if that were needed) to separatists in Catalonia and other frustrated European regions.
This is not really what anybody wants, not even the Germans, who are reluctant hegemons.
For this to be achieved, the EU must establish a common security policy and military force.
MADRID – The recent downgrade of Brazil’s credit rating to junk status was followed by a raft of articles heralding the crumbling of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).
The disparities among the BRICS are well known.
The BRICS arose at a time when much of the world, especially the advanced economies, was mired in crisis.
As for Russia, the only traditional world leader of the bunch, the Kremlin’s Ukraine policy has done severe damage to the country’s international profile – damage that not even its possible diplomatic coup in Syria can undo.
But it has not, and no other single power is in a position to take America’s place.
STANFORD – A few years ago, pundits and policymakers were predicting that the BRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – would be the new engines of global growth.
But, for the BRICS, continued rapid progress may become more difficult.
China, for its part, is attempting a difficult economic rebalancing, from an export-led to a consumption-based growth model. In poker terms, Chinese President Xi Jinping is attempting to pull an inside straight, gambling that a growing middle class will demand enough manufactured goods to prevent the economy’s immense excess capacity in basic industries from leading to widespread unemployment.
So far, China has played a pivotal role in driving progress toward real cooperation among the BRICS countries.
Even Jim O’Neill, who coined the term “BRIC,” has turned his attention to the “MINT” economies – Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey – the BRICS’ key emerging-country competitors.
In particular, the BRICS suffer from considerable income inequality, with their average Gini coefficient (where zero signifies absolute equality and one is absolute inequality) ranging from 0.37 to 0.50 in 2010-2013.
Furthermore, China’s BRICS partners face keen competition from cheap Chinese-manufactured goods (intensified by what many view as China’s undervalued currency).
But the decisions that Scotland would have to make about its monetary arrangements in the months following a vote for independence are at least as likely to be confronted by some eurozone countries over the next couple of years.
While the decision would have a significant political downside – that is, immediately diluting Scotland’s newly acquired sovereignty – its economic implications are mixed.
Italy is perhaps the prime candidate to lead an exit from the eurozone, though a political shock could also arise in France, spurring it to negotiate with Germany the dissolution of the monetary union.
With American home values and retirement savings falling and Chinese unemployment numbers rising, observers worry that neither America nor China will have much appetite to cut emissions.
Much of this credit comes from China, where firms and citizens save too much and consume too little, leaving a surplus of both goods and capital that flows abroad.
Yet these five industries combined employ only 14 million people out of a total labor force of 770 million and fewer people than they did a decade ago. For a country in an employment crisis, investing in energy-intensive industry is a losing strategy.
Twenty years ago – on June 4, 1989 – three events shaped a fateful year.
But if you watched the Eastern Bloc’s disintegration from the ground, you would know that the process was far longer and more complex than most people realize.
An iconic campaign poster captured the public mood: a picture of a gun-slinging Gary Cooper as the sheriff in the classic western High Noon .
“Oh, that sponging apparatchik, living high on our penury.”
Those of us covering Eastern Europe knew that Solidarity would win.
Strasbourg – The European Union recently embarked on a policy of “constructive engagement” with Belarus.
European officials have been at pains to prevent the EU’s enlargement from creating new dividing lines between Belarus and its neighbors to the west and north – Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia – that joined the Union in 2004.
Similarly, Belarus must, in turn, respond positively to the EU’s steps to normalize relations, one of which should be rescinding travel restrictions against Lukashenko and other senior officials.
With Belarus’s economy crumbling and its export markets withering, Russia could exploit Lukashenko’s vulnerability.
It is premature to invite Lukashenko to the opening summit of this initiative in Prague on May 7.
The Doha round of global free-trade talks has been abandoned, and the World Trade Organization is now languishing by the lake in Geneva, uncertain of its future.
But both are closing down in many countries.
As Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, acutely observed, “banks are global in life, but national in death.”
We can only hope that it does not catch on.
No Pain, No Gain for Britain?
Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University estimates that the damage might be as high as 15% of GDP.
The claim that “Keynes is to blame” for Labour’s election defeat is peculiarly odd.
The deficit, she rightly said, was “a symptom of economic difficulties, not just the cause of them.”
And fiscal austerity is still the reigning doctrine in the eurozone, thanks to Germany.
The UK’s national interests have not changed, and no fundamental shifts within the EU have worked against those interests.
When, in 2009, he ordered the Conservative MEPs to withdraw from the European People’s Party, the Europe-wide grouping of center-right political forces, he merely deprived the Tories – now consigned to sit with the sectarians and obscurantists – of any influence in the European Parliament.
This, however, requires an adequate understanding of those interests and a willingness to cooperate on the basis of mutual trust, which should be a given within the European family.
Indeed, continuity is the one election outcome that can almost certainly be excluded.
Moreover, Britain’s political institutions might be unable to cope.
But this is a dangerously complacent argument.
They tend to focus on whatever seems to be the biggest and most urgent story, and British politics has not been it.
The eastern members – most notably Poland and the Baltic states – are clinging fast to the EU in the face of Russian aggression. At the other geographic and political extreme, the United Kingdom is threatening to walk out on Europe for good.
The Norwegians must pay €2 billion ($2.1 billion) a year for access to European markets. Switzerland, like Norway, must take a back seat to the EU Commission when trade and investment decisions are made.
It must lead in mobilizing Europe to make the global economy work for people, protecting them from injustice and inequity.
But is it really true that the world can or should learn about China only by reading works that are sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party? After all, didn’t Boris Pasternak, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Milan Kundera, and Václav Havel teach the world as much about the repressive societies in which they lived than anything turned out by the Soviet bloc’s official publishers?
They want Chinese consumers to buy their products.
That “choice” may seem overwhelming, but it would be safe to bet that not one of these books probes impartially the taboos of Chinese politics and recent history. In China, thousands of “sensitive words,” including “self-immolating lamas,” “democracy,” “human rights,” “Tiananmen protest,” and even the title of my book Beijing Coma, cannot even be searched online.
Instead, the task of corrupting a centuries-old humanistic tradition has fallen to the Chinese Communist Party’s ignoble censor-in-chief and engineer of China’s literary exodus – and to the greed of some for Chinese gold.
Until recently, anyone who wished to bring a human-rights case against the British government had to go to France.
It also inhibits proper debate. After all, what responsible public body wants to be accused of violating human rights?
So much, then, for Article 6 of the European Convention, which provides that everyone charged with a criminal offense has the right “to be informed promptly” of the nature of the accusation against him.
In May, in his first major policy speech, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the sweeping away of the “Big Brother” state that Blair had constructed: no more ID cards or national identity register, new restrictions on the storage of DNA, tighter regulation of the closed-circuit television surveillance that had made the British the most monitored people on earth, and so on.
As the head of the government that carried out these acts, British Prime Minister David Cameron has betrayed his country’s most noble cultural legacy. Indeed, Britain essentially invented and gave the rest of the world the idea of free speech.
Will today’s constrictions on journalism in the UK be similarly transient? In the wake of the hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, Parliament pressured the British press into agreeing to a terrifying system of fines of up to a £1 million ($1.6 million) for news “errors.”
But much more needs to be done. Above all, Cameron’s political future – and that of all UK politicians – should depend on whether he upholds Britain’s tradition of free speech and public debate or continues to betray it.
As a result, Britain could not serve as a bridge between a doubtful Europe and a belligerent US, as Blair believed, and Britain’s capacity to be a force for good on the world stage was severely damaged.
The City of London, the British Council, Oxfam, and the BBC are now expected to restore the prominence of Britain’s enduring values.
May the next American president pursue this course.
David Cameron was polished but vague, and the jowly Brown came across as gun loaded with statistics.
And even though inequality of wealth and income in Britain increased in the 13 years Labour has been in power, this is thought to be something that a left-wing party might seek to correct, whereas there is no similar expectation for a party of the right.
The Conservatives’ pledge to start cutting the deficit immediately amounts to only a 1% reduction in the coming year.
The Conservatives want to reduce the size of the House of Commons by 10%.
As Winston Churchill said, the problem with committing political suicide is that you live to regret it.

I think he will do so – not least because the most potent electoral argument today is “time for change.”
It will require leadership skills of a high order to persuade voters that in order to prevent national decline we must curb our appetite for more and more public spending.
The longest election campaign in UK history has been strikingly short of focus.
Either way, the point is straightforward: statistical recovery is not enough.
Perhaps this reflects my own bias, but I suspect that this evasiveness on the part of Britain’s main political parties has weakened support for them, by diminishing their status as valid representatives of the country.
The party appears to be attracting many people who voted against independence but who want more regional autonomy and a stronger voice for Scotland in the Westminster Parliament.
What I do is not very sophisticated: I watch the bookmakers’ odds.
First, as in many other democracies, support for the United Kingdom’s two main political parties is declining.
Several factors make predicting the outcome even more problematic.
Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, seems to be just as unpopular in Scotland as his Conservative counterpart, Prime Minister David Cameron.
BRUSSELS – The outcome of the United Kingdom’s general election this week will set the direction the country will take in its long-term relations with the European Union.
Prime Minister David Cameron’s promise to hold a referendum on membership by 2017 if he is re-elected is not helpful in solving the problems that Britain and the rest of Europe face together: the need for higher growth and greater social inclusion amid unprecedented foreign-policy challenges.
Indeed, the preparations for negotiations on a new agreement among the EU institutions are less focused on the nature of the output of the legislation than on the sheer number of laws now on the books.
So perhaps achieving the Cameron government’s objective – to remain in a reformed EU after renegotiating the UK’s membership and renationalizing certain European competences – does not actually require treaty modification.
It is understandable that politicians should talk up their own vision of the future and talk down what others have to say.
As voters head to the polls on May 7, their would-be elected officials are asking them to believe three great falsehoods, each of which is dangerous in its own way.
Regardless of which party – Labour or Conservative – wins the largest number of seats in Parliament, its constituents would of course include many English voters, who would never agree to the SNP’s policy priorities.
A recent political cartoon showed British bombers taking off on a mission, with one pilot saying to the others, “It seems a long way to go to bomb a few young men from South London.”
But Cameron also knows that he must handle the negotiations with care.
The best way to do this would be to divide Europe into two groups.
In the meantime, Article 136 of the existing Treaty on the Functioning of the EU would allow for some preliminary steps, such as the designation of votes at the European Council that are reserved for eurozone countries only.
The Digital Road From Poverty
Similarly, the World Bank has shown that a 10% increase in broadband penetration increased GDP growth by 1.4% in low- to medium-income countries.
By 2020, the benefits would be almost $500 billion annually, and would continue to rise each year.
Nine hundred million people live in LDCs, and, as Pantelis Koutroumpis of Imperial College London points out, only 6.7% are Internet users.
This imperative has led many to demand larger contributions from Internet giants like Google, Netflix, and Facebook, which are frequently criticized for failing to pull their weight – and even lambasted as “free-riders,” intent on pillaging European assets and markets.
By investing in them, America’s Internet giants are providing tangible benefits for European consumers and companies.
Throughout the process, creative solutions will be paramount, and Internet companies’ contributions will be invaluable.
As ITU Secretary-General Hamadoun Touré has put it, “In the twenty-first century, affordable, ubiquitous broadband networks will be as critical to social and economic prosperity as networks like transport, water, and power.”
Likewise, mobile networks are delivering health services to the most remote areas of India.
By contrast, the average level of fixed-line telecommunication penetration in developing countries is nearly 50 years behind the levels of the West.
Using technology to deliver security will become even more important in areas such as information sharing, disaster management, and data-privacy standards.
The UN press release called the document a “global action plan” to achieve the MDGs, but it is more an expression of aspirations than a plan.
The net effect of all these changes, Pogge calculates, is that, whereas world leaders pledged in 1996 that by 2015 they would reduce the number of undernourished people to no more than 828 million, now they are pledging only to reduce the number in extreme poverty to 1.324 billion.
More people with HIV/AIDS are getting inexpensive anti-retroviral drugs and their life-expectancy has increased, but universal access is still far off, and the disease is still spreading, if more slowly than before.
PRINCETON – Ten years after its birth, Google is threatening to re-open the “Browser Wars” of the 1990’s, when Microsoft’s Internet Explorer eliminated its rival, Netscape’s Navigator. This time, however, it is Google’s Chrome that promises to transform the economics underlying the entire software industry, and not only because of its technical innovation in linking very different kinds of software to an Internet browser.
But this also reduced the possibility of choice, of selecting and combining different software.
In line with the philosophy of challenging dominant positions, the US Department of Justice in 1969 started a major investigation of IBM, which had just revolutionized business computing with its 360 line.
Google’s position is so interesting and so powerful because the legal philosophy that challenges any ascendant position, even in an industry that seems naturally to produce monopoly, remains in place.
Some have also interpreted it as evidence of a Russian-led effort to mobilize the major emerging economies – Brazil, India, and China – against the West.
In fact, the vast majority of the world’s strongest economies are allied with the US.
This is particularly true for China, because its domestic stability and international influence depend largely on its ability to maintain rapid economic growth, which demands ever-larger quantities of imported energy and other natural resources.
(China took the strongest position in the Security Council by abstaining.)
I don’t know, though I have some hunches.
There have been three colossal stock-market bubbles in the last century: the 1920’s, the 1960’s, and the 1990’s.
Increasing worries about global warming, and its effects on food prices, or about the cold and snowy winter in the northern hemisphere and its effects on heating fuel prices, are contagious stories.
Moreover, people nowadays easily imagine that the housing and farmland markets always move together, because prices in both boomed in recent memory, in the early 2000’s. But, from 1911 to 2010 in the US, the correlation between annual real growth of prices for homes and farmland was only 5%, and the latest data on farm prices have not shown anything like the decline in home prices.
Should priorities once again be reversed?
In the end, there would be little, if any, damaging impact on output.
But when the economy is booming, the effects of fiscal retrenchment are unlikely to be damaging.
Understanding which conditions are being met when and where helps to set the agenda for today.
In hazardous conditions, officials should not rely on rosy scenarios and hope that they will be believed.
At the nanometer scale (about 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), matter behaves in unusual ways: weak materials become strong, inert materials become active, and benign materials become harmful.
The US has been tremendously successful in promoting research strategies that support the use of nanotechnology, and has served as a model that is being duplicated around the world.
Some nations and regions are beginning to develop research agendas that respond to these five challenges.
In the global race for nanotechnology leadership, the winners will be those who understand the risks and support the research necessary to minimize them.
Second, CO2 is dangerously changing the world’s climate, even if many Big Oil interests would have us believe otherwise.
Two neighbors in Europe, Germany and France, are showing the way forward – or, more precisely, the alternative ways forward – to a low-carbon future.
The key point is that France and Germany, and many other European countries – including the Scandinavian countries, with their considerable wind and hydropower potential – are all recognizing that the world as a whole will have to move away from a fossil-fuel-based energy system.
MOSCOW – Greater Europe is at a crossroads.
This suggests that Russia, unable to compete with the world’s fast-developing countries, will have to direct its efforts towards protecting its waning assets.
Developments in these countries during the postcommunist years marked a gradual change from Russian to European influence, but that is not irreversible.
Moreover, both the US and China nowadays find Russia to be more strategically interesting than Europe, and that doesn’t go unnoticed in, say, Kiev or Minsk.
But model of integration followed from the 1990’s up until about 2005 was not a success.
Several economies that recently faced financial crises are rebounding strongly.
A lesson of the 1990's is that vulnerabilities must be dealt with before they become crises.
Aging populations are forcing many countries to address pressures on their budgets and social security systems.
Poverty also threatens economic stability.
The resilience of the global economy in the face of political and economic shocks demonstrates the central relevance of the reform process - and underlines the importance of continuing along this path.
When the government did not oblige, 50,000 people set out on the fabled Grand Trunk Road to Islamabad, taking 36 hours to complete the 300-kilometer trek.
The Supreme Court took note of the ADB’s findings and started proceedings against Ashraf and other senior officials, including several from the finance ministry.
Building Palestine From the Bottom Up
Both the Palestinians and Israel can easily and rightly be blamed for the failure of the Oslo process.
This empowerment of an effective local leadership was done with much persistence – and little fanfare. But these nuts-and-bolts projects created – for the first time – the building blocks necessary for effective Palestinian nation-building.
But the reality is starker: the intrusions by Chinese aircraft into Filipino airspace in May; Chinese patrol boats cruising in March in the Recto (Reed) Bank, 85 miles west of the Filipino island of Palawan; and, most serious of all, a Chinese missile frigate firing at Filipino fishing boats in February near Palawan’s Quirino atoll.
What is needed, above all, is a covenant among the leaders of the Asia/Pacific region that will make peaceful dispute resolution binding on all stakeholders, big or small.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and associated international commitments must become the basis for productive dialogues leading to binding covenants.
The old models about how to understand the economy have had their day. Across the globe, governments are facing fundamental decisions about the future nature of their economies and societies.
As we face the type of turning-point decisions not seen since the darkest days of the 1930’s, can we avoid such an outcome?
The mechanics of the welfare state will need to be strengthened; public policy must stop deferring to the financial sector, regardless of the need for bailout packages.
Built to Bust
And, starting that year, construction spending did indeed fall below trend.
And, in that alternative universe, having worked off the entire burden of overbuilding, we would by now have returned to trend levels of production, employment, and demand.
We know that when Americans become confident again – when they believe that they could find new jobs if they lost their current ones, and when they can no longer tolerate doubling-up with their in-laws – they will demand more dwellings than the country has today.
Rouhani has been largely successful in putting his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s tone-deaf leadership firmly in the past.
Rouhani recently had an opportunity to discuss Iran’s stance. But, addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, he squandered it, sticking to platitudes about the need for governments in the region to listen to their citizens and provide young people with “jobs and hope.”
Worse, he has refused to acknowledge Iran’s own role in the tragedy.
This is an unusual move, considering the Gulf states’ tradition of treating political disagreements as a family matter, to be handled behind the scenes.
The Muslim Brotherhood is not a violent organization, and it has not engaged in illegal activities in the Gulf countries.
There is a burgeoning desire for a future that dispenses with traditional policies based on fear and anger.
Clearly, this policy would be more constructive than Saudi Arabia’s desire for a lone-wolf role that merely results in a deadlock within and around the Gulf.
And, although Turkmenbashi died in December, his successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, has continued to imprison dissidents, stifle freedom of expression, and scoff at democracy, as February’s rigged elections demonstrate.
This is not the first time he has been arrested in Bulgaria. After first arriving, Hadjiev and his wife were arbitrarily detained for several days, leaving their 13-year-old daughter without supervision or access to her parents.
By releasing Annadurdy Hadjiev from jail and withdrawing the threat of extradition to Turkmenistan, Bulgaria would unequivocally demonstrate its commitment to fulfilling its obligations.
But then reality intruded. India’s strategic rivals, China and Pakistan, began to court the Burmese generals.
And India sweetened the generals’ tea by providing military assistance and intelligence support to their own never-ending counter-insurgencies.
India confronts an inescapable fact of geopolitics: you can put your ideals on hold, but you cannot change who your neighbors are.
Burma’s rulers have said that the vote will be delayed in the areas hardest hit by the cyclone until May 24, but the referendum will still go ahead as planned in other parts of the country.
More than seven months on from this brutal suppression, political activists continue to be imprisoned and tortured.
This lack of progress is less a reflection of Gambari's capabilities  than of the fact that he has not been empowered by the countries that  hold the most leverage over Burma’s rulers, including China, India, and  Burma's ASEAN neighbors.
The situation demands the Secretary-General’s direct involvement. Without it, the junta will continue to have a free hand to act against the human rights of the Burmese people.
In such conditions, free and fair elections will be impossible.
The dictatorship stands accused of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, mostly against the country’s minorities, who chafe at decades of oppression, ostracism, and military misrule.
Indeed, the decision was far from voluntary.
We know that Burma’s political destiny is inextricably linked to that of our own countries.
Preventing aid from reaching those in need is bad enough.
Her comment was an explicit reference to Allende’s last speech from the besieged La Moneda palace on September 11, 1973, when he declared that some day, much sooner than later, “we will reopen the great promenades down which free men pass.”
So it is small surprise that he left office with more than 75% popular support.
Thus, the general who yearned to see his picture in Chilean history books next to that of our liberator, Bernardo O’Higgins, must now resign himself to dying abandoned even by those who, until only two years ago, revered and honored him.
Bush Inherits the Wind
He disdains climate science and public health science when it conflicts with the beliefs – and interests – of his core supporters.
Hurricanes are measured according to three dimensions: frequency, intensity, and duration.
This can be done by changing the world’s energy system to limit emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – the main driver of manmade climate change.
Hurricane Katrina is a wakeup call, not only for the US but for the world.
In recent years, a majority of the Justices of the Supreme Court have articulated a multilateralist view of American law that stands in marked contrast to the unilateralism of the Bush Administration.
Alarmed by this dramatic volte-face, the majority Justices in the Guantanamo Bay case may be trying to send assurances to the rest of the world that President Bush does not speak for all Americans, not even the ones who put him in office in the first place.
Or perhaps the Justices were simply reacting to the Administration's constant overreaching.
There is a market failure when it comes to energy, but government intervention should run in precisely the opposite direction from what the Bush administration has proposed.
With world oil production close to full capacity and prices already more than double their pre-Iraq War level, this portends still higher prices, and still higher profits for the oil industry – the only clear winner in Bush’s Middle East policy.
Productivity gains had stalled, energy prices were high, the backlog of potential technologies that originated in the Great Depression had been exhausted, and waning benefits from economies of scale led nearly every economist to project that economic growth would be slower in the future than it had been in the past.
Everyone who worries about America’s weak fiscal position puts Social Security’s relatively small funding imbalance far down the list of priorities. The highest priority problem is the overall budget’s medium-run outlook, as the Bush tax cuts have opened Reagan-size deficits that threaten to cripple US economic growth.
The second is ideology.
Israeli hardliners saw the “war on terror” and the war in Iraq as their wars, supported Bush’s war-like rhetoric and isolation of Iran, and considered the neo-conservatives their ideological kin.
They also know, of course, that any serious engagement with the Palestinian question must imply engaging Hamas in the search for a two-state solution.
An American dialogue with Iran will be a serious blow to the interests of Israeli hardliners, and some of them dream of making it impossible.
It is a policy that has proved to be ineffective, and that is illegal under international law because it targets Israeli civilians.
Bush’s initiative is a last-ditch effort to salvage America’s position in a region where it is on the defensive on all fronts.
The Saudis certainly have an interest in supporting this last ditch American attempt for an Israeli-Palestinian peace, especially now that, for the first time ever, Israel has refrained from opposing an arms deal between the US and Saudi Arabia.
Such a sequence – and a conference whose harmless aim is “to review progress toward building Palestinian institutions, look for ways to support further reforms, and support the effort going on between the parties” – fits perfectly with the Israeli view.
But these statistics mask a glaring fact: the average American family is worse off than it was three and half years ago.
The economy was entering a downturn when Bush took office, but Clinton also left a huge budget surplus - 2% of GDP ­­- a pot of money with which to finance a robust recovery.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office agrees that even without Bush's new expenditure initiatives and tax proposals, costing trillions of dollars, the deficit will not be eliminated in the foreseeable future - or even cut in half, as Bush has promised. Expenditures on which America's future economic health depends - on infrastructure, education, health, and technology - will be crowded out, jeopardizing long-term growth.
The real risk is that this is one promise that Bush, if re-elected, will try to keep.
As those policies fail, global financial markets are reacting negatively, adding uncertainty to the world economy, and there is little relief in sight, because America is entering a period of prolonged political infighting and stalemate.
The military-plus-security budget soared by more than 2% of GNP, while tax revenues fell by much more. At the same time, Bush supported expenditure increases for popular items like education and prescription drug benefits, but paid for these services by borrowing the money rather than ensuring sufficient tax revenues.
In a bizarre, but not unexpected way, America is lashing out at others for its problems.
Bush’s gamble was a loser from the start, generating costly results – mainly for the US, but for the rest of the world, too – for years to come.
Dousing a naked detainee with water was to last 20 minutes if the water’s temperature measured 5 °C, 40 minutes at 10 °C, and up to 60 minutes at 15 °C. Sleep deprivation could not exceed 180 hours, but could start over again after eight hours rest.
Instead, it has a legal standard.
To that end, mental damage is preferable to physical injury.
Should we therefore prosecute them?
A war that cannot be ended is sometimes worse than a war that is lost.
There is simply no way that Iraq can be stabilized without America moving from a policy of disengagement to one of engagement with these two major regional spoilers.
Alas, however bipartisan the Iraq Study Group’s report may be, it is too much to expect that Bush will endorse all of its recommendations and admit the bankruptcy of his entire foreign policy.
Bush’s New Middle East
The most serious unintended consequence of the war is the emergence of a powerful Shia challenge to the West’s Sunni allies in the Middle East.
If anything, America’s debacle in Iraq has only emboldened the challengers of the status quo in the region.
Bush’s Old New Plan for Iraq
Bush has long claimed that the number of troops in Iraq was a military decision and that he simply followed the advice of his generals, but now this is clearly not the case.
In fact, it turned out that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were the ones wildly off the mark. Now both are gone, and Bush is turning to troop increases.
At best, the overthrow of Saddam removed a threatening dictator, and substituted a tyranny of the majority for the tyranny of a minority.
Indeed, only by effectively addressing the Israeli-Arab dispute can he possibly salvage America’s standing in the region.
The concept of interim agreements has now become utterly obsolete, if only because the parties are incapable of paying the political price inherent in an open-ended, piecemeal process.
The end of bilateralism stems also from the dysfunctional political systems of both Palestine and Israel.
Bush’s Second Gulf Disaster
FEMA was downsized and downgraded from a cabinet position, then placed under the Department of Homeland Security.
For example, Florida (with 16 more electoral votes than Louisiana and where the president’s brother governs) received its requested funding to protect its wetlands.
Ideologies of privatization that incapacitate effective government, permitting the privileged to save themselves while leaving the poor clinging to roofs, must now be challenged.
Before flying to Brazil, Bush said that his administration doesn’t get enough credit for its Latin American policy.
Numerous heads of state and dignitaries from around the world attended the ceremony.
Moreover, the handful of free-trade agreements signed with individual countries, or groups of countries, are lopsided and overwhelmingly favor US interests.
What explains this apparent contradiction?
The twin symbols are Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib.
BERLIN – Despite continuing tensions over Russia’s invasion of Georgia this August, the European Union will reopen talks with Russia on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA).
In private, however, many allied officials have told the media that they are even less inclined than they previously were to deepen NATO’s ties with Georgia, given the risks of becoming entrapped in another Russian-Georgian war.
In September and October, the country’s strategic forces engaged in their largest nuclear weapons-related exercises since the Soviet Union’s demise.
Russia’s military also must compete with foreign customers for those few warplanes, tanks, and other sophisticated weapons that are produced.
BERKELEY – Investors worldwide are increasingly seeking investment opportunities that promise to bring environmental and social benefits, in addition to market rates of return.
And a new study by Morgan Stanley’s Institute for Sustainable Investing, which analyzed the performance of 10,228 open-ended mutual funds and 2,874 separately managed accounts in the US, found that sustainable investments usually met – and often exceeded – the median returns of comparable traditional investments for the periods examined.
This new approach to company valuation reflects the view that the most successful companies will be those that deploy all four kinds of capital responsibly.
In fact, if a company is to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to its investors, it has little choice but to go beyond financial returns to incorporate ESG factors that are likely to have a material impact on its performance over time.
For decades, the Swiss multinational defined itself strictly as one the world’s leading food companies.
In today’s fast-paced world, it takes only a single technological improvement, price advantage, or great viral advertising campaign for a competitor to leap ahead.
Overcoming historic biases requires questioning an industry’s taboos.
At least 20% of a company’s board should be composed of individuals from outside the industry.
With minds concentrated by fears of another 1930’s-style Great Depression, America’s political leaders developed, virtually overnight, a $700 billion bailout plan to resuscitate the country’s rapidly deflating financial sector.
Little did I imagine that today, there would be no freestanding investment bank left on Wall Street.
True, the Treasury would take equity stakes in some firms, so there would be some upside potential.
That was a big lesson of the 1930’s.
A specter is haunting us again; this time it is the dream of truly democratizing capitalism.
Governments around the world are spending money on regulating and monitoring their stock markets so that they are safer for individual investors, and so that investor interest in these markets will grow.
The purpose of the gifts is to “encourage parents and children to develop the saving habit and engage with financial institutions.”
But there is also a higher risk of disaster, owing to a seemingly inborn human tendency to extrapolate past returns.
The United States received its first shock – followed by complaints from the US Congress – when the Chinese computer company Lenovo Group purchasing IBM’s personal computer division. Never mind that by 2000 China had invested less than $400 million in the US, while Britain had invested over $230 billion and Japan $159 billion.
It is difficult to judge whether it is the symbolism of such deals, concerns about national security, or the slowly dawning recognition that America’s position of assumed economic preeminence is being challenged that upsets Americans most.
China must be both encouraged and allowed to play by the global rules, even when the symbolism of its progress may be painful to endure.
During this time, the international community has also dramatically changed.
Her foreign policy – called “Trustpolitik” – aims to transform this atmosphere of suspicion and conflict into one of confidence and cooperation, and to build “a new Korean Peninsula, a new Northeast Asia, and a new world.”
For example, it would involve implementing the UN’s 1,000-day project for maternal health and infant nutrition, aimed at ending the North’s chronically high rate of infant malnutrition.
But Peru boasts another impressive characteristic: it is among Latin America’s fastest-growing economies, with GDP up by 4.8% year on year in the first quarter of 2014.
Moreover, under the new law, subnational governments will no longer be able to limit investments on environmental grounds – decisions that were guided by strict technical standards and highly trained experts.
Last month, the Congress also moved to weaken the government’s environmental oversight, claiming that this would add 1.5-3% to the economy’s growth rate.
Calderon’s Cauldron
Fox’s term, along with the four last years of former President Ernesto Zedillo’s mandate, were hardly a failure.
But the foundations of the old PRI-corporativist system created in the 1930’s remain untouched, and represent the main and most formidable obstacles to Mexico’s growth and success.
The main parties write their own anti-trust legislation, vote their own subsidies, and choose their own elected officials. The absence of consecutive re-election at any level reinforces the party machines’ power: they pick candidates, whom voters merely ratify at the polls.
Slowing the rate of alteration is the only rational course of action, given the potential outcomes. But we also need to examine our responses closely, or risk repeating our shortsighted behavior.
Now, astronomers have discovered a remarkable abundance of planets orbiting other stars.
In other words, the cosmic sprawl can help us disentangle the complex terrestrial systems and histories of which we are a part.
Higher levels of government are “on the hook” to bail out local insolvent governments, and may even suffer bond downgrades as a result; in Spain, Italy, and China, that role falls to the national government, and for US cities and towns, to their states.
Three California cities have recently declared bankruptcy: Stockton, the largest American city ever to do so; San Bernardino, the second-largest bankrupt city; and Mammoth Lakes.
The state would be expected to take over essential public services from bankrupt local governments.
The state income tax is not only uncompetitively high, but the revenues are volatile.
Berkeley – While the new Obama administration is commanding global attention, America’s future may be written – as so many times before – in and by its largest state.
Because other American states also face tough fiscal conditions, the political price of bailing out California may be bailing out dozens of other states too.
California’s governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was an immigrant (from Austria) before he was a movie star.
More radical thinkers insist that California is ungovernable and should be broken into two or even three states.
If Californians refuse, Obama could face a widening revolt – against the idea of expanded government as the chief response to what ails America at home.
The law that is valid for all other companies should apply to banks as well.
Obviously, the domino effect need not stop there: the insolvency of banks A and B could get a bank C – and additional banks – into trouble.
CANBERRA – The South China Sea – long regarded, together with the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula, as one of East Asia’s three major flashpoints – is making waves again.
Such a claim would cover four disputed sets of land features: the Paracel Islands in the northwest, claimed by Vietnam as well; the Macclesfield Bank and Scarborough Reef in the north, also claimed by the Philippines; and the Spratly Islands in the south (variously claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei, in some cases against each other as well as against China.)
China can and should lower the temperature by re-embracing the modest set of risk-reduction and confidence-building measures that it agreed with ASEAN in 2002 – and building upon them in a new, multilateral code of conduct.
At the same time, the movement faces new questions about its ability to take advantage of the diplomatic opportunities that it has gained.
Nonetheless, recent events, together with the PA’s dwindling resources, have diminished Abbas’s credibility among Palestinians, who increasingly view him as desperate.
Palestinian and Israeli leaders will have to reconcile their differences and reach a diplomatic settlement.
Here, Israel may come under growing pressure from its principal ally.
Initially, the dollar’s price rose, but since 2002, it has, for the most part, fallen steadily.
Both disregard the fact that rationality depends as much on individuals’ imperfect understandings of history and society as on their motivation.
This should moderate bulls’ willingness to increase their long positions, thereby limiting the magnitude of the swing.
As Milton Friedman emphasized, however, the links between monetary policy and inflation are “long and variable.”
During the past eight years, the economy put up exceptional indicators: GDP grew almost 70% (nearly as dynamic as China) and formal employment increased more than 30%.
Since mid-2007, expectations regarding long-term sustainability have been weakening.
This is eroding the external surplus, weakening domestic purchasing power, and causing investments to be postponed.
This time, it had better make the most of it.
The agreement on contributions is significant, it is said, because China and Japan will both contribute 32%.
Countries putting money on the barrelhead want assurances that their resources will not be used frivolously, and they want to know that they will be repaid.
It could be placed inside the Asian Development Bank in Manila.
But it would at least head off one danger, namely the urge to accumulate even more reserves.
In the past, Asians put a premium on protecting their sovereignty and were wary of any multilateral approaches that could dilute it.
Indeed, if the vast majority of the four billion Asians continue to improve their livelihoods, the world would become a better place.
Climate Change: Asia needs to build up innovative markets that enable technology transfer.
In response to each challenge, Asians respond pragmatically.
Business ethics has always had problems that are distinct from those of other professions, such as medicine, law, engineering, dentistry, or nursing.
In that tradition, the economist Milton Friedman wrote, in his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom :  “there is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.”
LONDON – On September 16, 1992, a date that lives in infamy in the United Kingdom as “Black Wednesday,” the Bank of England abandoned its efforts to keep the British pound within its permitted band in the European exchange-rate mechanism.
The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 convinced governments and central banks that countries that maintained exchange controls were able to weather the storm better than countries that embraced liberalization.
Sarkozy’s rhetoric suggests that he hankers after new international agreements on exchange rates, and, indeed, perhaps a new global reserve currency.
But the long run can be long indeed, and the influence of speculative capital flows can be substantial and sustained.
Can China Beat Deflation?
But it was too little too late.
The problem with the emergence of these new growth engines is that it enabled China’s leaders to delay important structural reforms.
Complicating this effort is the fact that, unlike in 1997-2002, China cannot absorb overcapacity by stimulating real-estate investment and exports.
The Renminbi Challenge
Meanwhile, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Chile have already acquired modest amounts of renminbi reserves.
Falling prey to a crisis would not exactly encourage international use of China’s currency.
Until now, constraints on decision-making by the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the country’s highest-ranking official, have been – how to put it politely? – limited.
Poison-Proofing China
Eggs contaminated that year with melamine caused kidney stones and renal failure in children.
Only a few decades ago, China was a poor, largely rural country with an agrarian economy and almost no middle class. Today, it boasts the world’s second-largest economy, a thriving manufacturing sector, and a rapidly growing, prosperous middle class, while more than half of China’s 1.5 billion citizens now live in cities. 
Some have thus called upon major emerging countries to step up and use their huge foreign-exchange reserves to purchase the debt of crisis-ravaged countries, such as Greece, Italy, and Spain.
The EU is China’s largest trading partner, accounting for $383 billion in merchandise exports in 2010.
China’s sovereign wealth fund and non-bank financial institutions have been eager to invest in well-established Western banks.
Can Chinese Industry Be Made Safe?
Even though China instituted new initiatives in industrial safety at the beginning of 2003, official estimates indicate that industrial accident deaths increased by almost 10% last year.
In recent decades, some of the most dangerous work has been shipped overseas (ironically, much of it to China).
There are many different ways that legal systems can respond to occupational safety problems.
Edicts and exhortations from the State Council are all well and good.
Similarly, an American citizen carried out the worst terrorist attack in the United States before September 11, 2001.
Democracy, however, is more than just elections. It also requires tolerance of minorities and respect for individual rights, as well as the development of effective institutions for resolving political conflicts in divided societies.
The Bush administration may be correct in arguing that the extremely high costs and risks of promoting democracy are less than the costs and risks of allowing the authoritarian status quo in the Middle east to persist indefinitely.
After all, this time it was not they that had engaged in financial excess, and their economic fundamentals looked strong.
Moreover, slow growth in the advanced economies need not exert a drag on developing countries’ performance.
Worse still, labor has been displaced from more productive tradable activities (in manufacturing) to less productive informal activities (services).
These institutions reflected American interests, but they also codified certain norms of behavior – rule-based decision-making, non-discrimination, multilateralism, transparency – which eventually came to constrain American power as well.
To have a significant impact on Italian and Spanish borrowing costs, the latest effort must be big enough to dispel the convertibility risk that underlies the extreme polarization of government bond yields across the eurozone: investors are loathe to hold Spanish and Italian debt, because they fear that both countries might be forced to leave the currency union.
In nominal terms, Italian and Spanish borrowing costs are indeed comparable to the levels of the late 1990’s.
The polarization of borrowing costs has politically explosive distributional effects: Germany is borrowing and refinancing its existing debt at artificially low interest rates.
And it is the ECB’s credibility problem, not that of member states, that is the principal reason for unsustainably high borrowing costs in Italy, Spain, and other distressed eurozone countries.
But East Asia’s wide variety of political systems makes such a democratic consensus highly unlikely, at least for now.
In contrast to Europe, East Asia is composed of states that are radically different in terms of their size, development, and political-economic systems.
The nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, could give rise to another issue-specific regional institution, this one focused on nuclear safety.
But will the political transition ultimately lead to democracy?
In the same way, the Muslim Brotherhood could seize power in Egypt and impose a far more oppressive regime than Mubarak’s ever was.
After they overthrew communism in 1989, the peoples of Central Europe gravitated to democracy because that was the prevailing form of government in the countries of Western Europe, with which they strongly identified.
The fact that the large protest movement that suddenly materialized has, until now, been a peaceful one also counts as an advantage for building democracy.
High growth and financial stability in emerging economies are helping to facilitate the massive adjustment facing industrial countries.
This is likely to continue.
Fortunately, several emerging economies continue to have cushions and shock absorbers.
Political and policy narratives are becoming more domestic and narrow, while the international agenda and the pursuit of collective common global interests are having greater difficulty being heard.
But they do not operate in a vacuum.
Global economic instability correlates strongly with energy-price volatility.
Its membership remains restricted to OECD countries, even though surging demand from non-member countries like China and India is rapidly undermining the IEA’s ability to speak for, and coordinate responses among, oil importers as a group.
As is true of other global problems, much depends on the capacity and willingness of the most powerful national governments to find ways to act collectively.
Multinational companies were a driving force in Eastern Europe’s postcommunist transition, bringing new skills, technology, training, and better working conditions.
By contrast, African countries often see the worst sides of multinationals: energy, mineral, and precious metal companies go where resources are, not where it’s pleasant to work.
Enter Smicor, a subsidiary of Israel’s Leviev group that currently produces only a small proportion of the country’s diamond output but wants more exploration licenses. In 2004, Smicor promised to establish the higher-value diamond-cutting business that the government craves, and has since recruited and trained 400 workers in a new plant in the capital, Windhoek.
Poor traders like Rosalia want real shops, and for some, Namibia Beverages, the local bottling operation of Coca-Cola, is answering the call with sturdy iron cabins that are spacious, portable, and easily secured.
The fact is, the BP oil spill is on the cusp of becoming a political game-changer of historic proportions.
A carbon tax can help preserve the atmosphere while also discouraging some of the most exotic and risky energy-exploration activities by making them unprofitable.
But they might be radicalized by the prospect of inheriting a badly damaged ecosystem.
ATHENS ­­– Even as the European Union and the International Monetary Fund lay the groundwork for a giant first-round bailout, debate is swirling about whether Greece can avoid sovereign default.
Indeed, the historical evidence slams you over the head with the fact that, whereas government debt can drift upward inexorably for years, the end usually comes quite suddenly.
Some countries are almost inevitably going to experience bailouts and defaults.
But you cannot outrun a lion, says the other man, to which the first replies: “I don’t have to outrun the lion. I just have to outrun you.”
Can Green Trade Tariffs Combat Climate Change?
European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and industrial chambers of commerce strongly advocate a similar tariff system, leading many analysts to predict that the EU will also adopt some sort of green tariff system in the next few years.
Despite the threat of trade wars, trade sanctions could emerge as the most effective means of forcing international action on global warming.
Indeed, Article 22 of that charter reveals that Hamas views the Jews (together with the Freemasons and other nefarious organizations like Rotary International and the Lions Club), as responsible for the French and Bolshevik Revolutions, World War I, and World War II.
Yet, at the same time, the US supports Abu Mazen, trying to undermine the Hamas government, thus casting a shadow on the credibility of its own commitment to democracy.
But that decision, and its moral costs, remains in the hands of the Palestinians alone.
Its deployment in Lebanon, its fighting capacity, and its thousands of missiles are all still intact.
Without the ability to resupply itself, Hezbollah would emerge from any future war a significantly weakened force.
Strategically, Hezbollah fears that if Assad falls, and if it loses the ability to resupply itself rapidly and effectively as a result, Israel will take advantage by unleashing another war against it.
Sinai is hardly alone.
But this economic logic does not apply in the case of increases in oil prices.
A tax on oil, however, does not entail excess burdens. On the contrary, it implies excess benefits .
The first is to rely on deterrence and live with an Iran that has a small nuclear arsenal or the ability to assemble one with little advance notice.
This hypothesis may soon get a real-world test.
The compromise that Iranian officials are suggesting is nowhere near what they would have to accept to avert military action and gain an easing of sanctions.
It is possible that the new economic and political context will lead Iran’s rulers to accept what they have rebuffed until now.
Can Italy Survive Berlusconi?
During Berlusconi’s tenure in office, his enormous personal assets have tripled.
His campaign rhetoric highlights anti-communism with an emphasis not seen in Italy since 1948, coupled with a defense of the family and values cherished by the Roman Catholic establishment, although the Church has so far resisted being drawn into the campaign.
This is reminiscent of an army that, fearing defeat on the battlefield, poisons the wells as it retreats.
Italians must decide upon the sort of Italy they want if they are to get leaders of the stature they need.
The low level of intraregional trade, despite the SADC and COMESA, reflects several factors, including a range of non-tariff barriers – mainly communication and transport problems, customs procedures and charges, and a lack of market information.
The new initiative calls for all member states to harmonize their economic, fiscal, and monetary policies completely, beginning with currency convertibility and followed by exchange-rate unification and, finally, a common currency. Several currencies have attained some measure of regional convertibility, which should encourage monetary harmonization and promote intraregional trade, as countries’ trade flows shift from partners that require payment in foreign currency.
Indeed, South Africa and Angola alone accounted for 73% of the region’s inward FDI in 2003.
It detonated a hydrogen bomb in 1952, only one year after the US, and it was the first to launch a satellite into space, in 1957.
In the late 1970’s, a “Committee on the Present Danger” argued that Soviet power was surpassing that of the US, and the 1980 American election reflected such fears.
Whereas ethnic Russians comprised only 50% of the Soviet Union’s population, they now make up 81% of the Russian Federation.
But, as Katinka Barysch of the Centre for European Reform argues, Russian leaders’ concept of modernization is overly statist, particularly given that public institutions function so badly.
Can Russia be Saved?
With oil prices plummeting 70% from their peak (and similar price declines for metals, Russia’s other major export), it is no surprise that Russia is facing severe economic challenges.
In the last two months of 2008, the central bank allowed the ruble to weaken at a rate of 1% per week, then at 2-3% per week.
A massive liquidity injection by the government ensured that no major bank collapsed, and minor bank failures were administered in a surprisingly orderly fashion.
All the ugly facts that Russians ignored during the years of fast economic growth are bubbling to the surface.
Then, in the 1990’s, the government abandoned negotiations when the FARC assassinated a former secretary of state.
And they have.
The agenda will focus on ending the conflict, without endless discussion of theoretical or doctrinaire questions.
VIENNA– Europe’s current financial squeeze defies easy solutions.
So why, critics ask, does Europe produce many novel scientific ideas and discoveries, but fail to transform them into marketable products?
For example, it could lead to more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient uses of natural resources, or to investment in services that are more responsive to human needs and better attuned to human interaction.
This was the case in 1700, and it remains true today.
DAKAR – Senegal’s people are deeply disenchanted.
Thousands marched in protest to the National Assembly in June, and the amendment has since been withdrawn.
During the global recession in 2009, Africa and Asia were the only two regions where GDP rose.
Due to its superior infrastructure relative to Senegal, Ghana has attracted many billions of dollars more in foreign investment and records much higher trade volumes.
This much we know: terrorism is fueled by anger and frustration.
Until then, all means are legitimate when fighting a powerful and wicked enemy.
Moreover, appeasement is based on the dangerous assumption that the extremists’ objectives are limited – that once they attain their stated goals by using violence, they will become responsible members of the world community.
In some societies, democracy is simply a way for the majority to repress the minority.
Can the Elephant Dance with the Dragon?
If China wants to build a new six-lane expressway, it can bulldoze its way through any village in its path.
But it has been a while since Indians and Chinese had much to do with each other.
The key operating components of Apple’s iPod were invented by the Hyderabad company PortalPlayer, while the iPod itself are manufactured in China.
What could replace them?
But Germany (and its Constitutional Court), partly following popular opinion, has opposed giving Greece the help that it needs.
Assume that the euro was set so that trade in the eurozone as a whole was roughly in balance.
The social and economic consequences of the current arrangements should be unacceptable.
Can the Euro Zone Survive Economic Recovery?
But, as the overall economy of the euro zone improves, the ECB will start to reduce liquidity and raise the short-term interest rate, which will be more appropriate for some countries than for others.
Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and even Italy are often cited as countries that might benefit from being able to pursue an independent monetary policy and allow their currencies to adjust to more competitive levels.
Because individuals from the departing country could continue to hold euros, leaving the EMU would not cause a loss of existing wealth.
Russia’s gradual inclusion in the G-8 was supposed to nurture the growth of democracy, foster creation of a free-market economy, and encourage constructive behavior in international relations.
In these circumstances, given Russia’s continuing failure to meet the G-8’s political and economic standards, the upcoming summit in St. Petersburg could produce a backlash, eroding the legitimacy, credibility, and relevance of the world’s most developed countries.
But to hold a G-8 meeting in St. Petersburg in an atmosphere of “business as usual” may be even more dangerous.
Incredibly, the US is now soaking up roughly two-thirds of all global net saving, a situation without historical precedent.
Though the exact details remain to be decided, such steps might include more exchange-rate flexibility in China, and perhaps a promise from the US to show greater commitment to fiscal restraint.
What better way for new US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, a card-carrying environmentalist, to make a dramatic entrance onto the world policy stage?
And now that France, reeling from the Paris attacks, has declared war on the Islamic State, other European countries are shrugging their shoulders, mumbling condolences, and silently hoping that the conflict will spare them.
Moreover, the proposed measures would compound Europe’s public-debt problems by reducing interest-rate spreads among countries even further, sustaining asset-price bubbles, and destroying the capital market’s allocative role.
Given this, it is understandable that France prefers fiscal to political unification.
It is time for the EU to change its approach to integration.
Basically, it all boiled down to a grand bargain: while developing countries would obviously have primary responsibility for achieving the MDGs, developed countries would be obliged to finance and support their efforts for development.
Developed country tariffs on imports of agricultural products, textiles, and clothing – the principal exports of most developing countries – remained between 5% and 8% in 2008, just 2-3 percentage points lower than in 1998.
We must change the way the world goes about the business of providing development aid.
Many countries are prevented from trading their way out of poverty by the high tariff barriers, domestic subsidies, and other protections enjoyed by their rich-country competitors.
At first glance, monetizing an abundant natural resource (solar energy) to strengthen the national accounts sounds like a straightforward idea, particular given that electricity in central and northern Europe is becoming more scarce and expensive, owing to Germany’s decision earlier this year to phase out nuclear power.

This would make German support for renewables cheaper and generate some income in Greece, without compromising on European renewables deployment. But no one should expect to strike solar gold.
So much has changed since then.
Iran’s long-standing opposition to relations with the US is a bit more complex.
Instead, they have concrete demands, like jobs and political and social freedom.
The two are related: more tourists might boost the economy, but they would damage Bhutan’s environment and culture, and so reduce happiness in the long run.
One important question is whether we see happiness as the surplus of pleasure over pain experienced over a lifetime, or as the degree to which we are satisfied with our lives.
We may agree that our goal ought to be promoting happiness, rather than income or gross domestic product, but, if we have no objective measure of happiness, does this make sense? John Maynard Keynes famously said: “I would rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.”
One controversial law that did go ahead recently – and that indicates how willing the government is to take tough measures that it believes will maximize overall happiness – is a ban on the sale of tobacco.
This is unfortunate.
Indeed, when deciding how much disaster aid to offer, countries often seem to be influenced mainly by their leaders’ concerns about how others will view them.
Moreover, designing new risk-management products is not easy. Insurance companies face inherent difficulties in measuring risks, and they must tailor their policies creatively around the human foibles that limit uptake.
The Kyoto Protocol created a mechanism for trading carbon dioxide emissions, which promises to manage the risks of an even bigger potential disaster: global warming.
The lesson is clear: even high-class businesses are only as professional as the existing institutional infrastructure permits them to be.
Finally, crises are highly non-linear events, which means that they occur without much warning.
Extreme fiscal imbalance can also lead to a growth trap in which fiscal consolidation has such a large negative effect on growth as to be self-defeating.
Asset bubbles are hard to identify with certainty.
This seems wrong.
If one believes that market instability is rare, then it is reasonable to refuse to act unless there is a compelling case to do so.
If more screening can detect breast cancer in asymptomatic women in their 40’s, wouldn’t it also detect cancer in women in their 30’s? And, if so, why not, reductio ad absurdum, begin monthly mammograms at age 15?
A related concern is measurement.
If your doctor tells you that you have tested positive, does this mean that you are likely to have the cancer? Surprisingly, the answer is no.
Moreover, the patients who receive these faulty diagnoses will usually receive further treatments, which often will have harmful consequences.
2011 में मैंने जब रवांडा में काम करना शुरू किया तभी मैं इस बात को पूरी तरह से समझ पाई कि मुझे जो उपकरण मिले हुए हैं वे कितने शक्तिशाली हैं और उनके न होने का क्या असर होता है। किगाली में केंद्रीय सार्वजनिक रेफरल अस्पताल में बाल-चिकित्सा कैंसर वार्ड में जाना समय से पीछे चले जाने जैसा था। विल्म्स ट्यूमर, जो एक तरह का गुर्दे का कैंसर होता है और वयस्कों को विरले ही कभी होता है, से ग्रसित रवांडा के बच्चों में पाए गए परिणाम हू-बहू अमेरिका में 80 साल पहले के समान थे, ये उन दवाओं की उपलब्धता से पहले के थे जिनसे आज इस रोगनिदान वाले 90% से अधिक अमेरिकी बच्चे जीवित रहने में सक्षम होते हैं।
कैंसर की वैश्विक मृत्यु दरों को कम करने के लिए सबसे कुशल दृष्टिकोण यह होगा कि विकासशील देशों में कैंसर के रोगियों को मौजूदा उपचार मुहैया कराए जाएँ। इसमें कैंसर के इलाज के लिए उस तरह के अंतर्राष्ट्रीय वित्तपोषण को भी जोड़ें, जिसे एड्स राहत के लिए अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति की आपातकालीन योजना और ग्लोबल फंड के माध्यम से एचआईवी/एड्स के लिए जुटाया गया था, इससे विकासशील देशों में कैंसर से होनेवाली मृत्यु दरों में भारी कमी हो सकती है, और जल्दी भी।
For some health issues – such as elevated cholesterol – screening yields positive results: a simple blood test measures the amounts of good and bad cholesterol in the blood, making it easier to detect related cardiovascular disease, which could lead to heart attacks or strokes.
But screening’s benefits are not as straightforward as supporters claim.
Yet many refuse to give up screening.
BALTIMORE – As each new day brings word of another Wall Street bailout even more colossal than the last, one question presents itself with ever-increasing force: why does America’s economy perform so badly under Republican presidents?
Nor are there clearly identifiable differences in doctrine that should translate into a reasonable expectation of better economic performance under one party than the other.
What do we learn from this example? It’s hard to say.
MELBOURNE – Is the global financial crisis an opportunity to forge a new form of capitalism based on sound values?
But will the downturn also produce a deeper shift in the values of consumers?
In his inauguration speech, American President Barack Obama said, “The time has come to set aside childish things” and instead to choose the noble idea that “all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.”
If people were really concerned about defensible moral values, they wouldn’t be buying designer clothes at all.
But, unlike the US Federal Reserve, it has not lowered key interest rates, which is what matters most to firms and households.
A US subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, for example, has been barred by an American court from foreclosing on a house because it could not demonstrate ownership.
The average real wage has been flat in the US for 20 years, with 1% of the population capturing all of the gains brought about by a 50% growth in GDP during this period.
We in the developed world live in democracies.
Like the financial crisis itself, this trend is now global.
That pattern is being repeated elsewhere.
Our first glimpse of the trouble in coordinating an international response to the financial crisis came last November, during the emergency G-20 summit in Washington.
They have mismanaged their way into a deep crisis, betraying all of the lofty promises of unity and prosperity issued when the euro was created.
Many firms are able to renegotiate financing terms with their creditors – typically extending the maturity of their liabilities, which enables them to borrow more to finance new, better projects.
And yet, in the end, Greece had little choice but to restructure its debt, cutting the value of private claims by about 75% relative to their face value (although even this is probably not enough to make the country’s debt burden sustainable).
They stood to lose billions, and many financial-sector employees stood to lose their jobs.
STOCKHOLM – A quiet revolution is taking place in the financial industry.
Meanwhile, the divestment movement is snowballing, with faith-based communities, municipalities, celebrities, trade unions, universities, and institutional investors all pledging to unload their fossil-fuel assets.
According to the International Energy Agency, two-thirds of these reserves must be kept in the ground if the world is to avoid runaway climate change, which implies that companies may not be able to exploit their full economic potential.
A range of institutions are starting to embrace sustainable development considerations in their financial decision-making.
पेरिस सम्मेलन से पहले किए गए अध्ययनों में यह सुझाया गया है कि अंतरराष्ट्रीय सहयोग से ग्रीन हाउस गैसों को तेजी से कम किया जा सकता है। इनमें स्थानीय प्रदूषण की कमी, ऊर्जा और खाद्य की अधिक से अधिक सुरक्षा, और तेजी से नवाचार सहित, जलवायु परिवर्तन पर त्वरित कार्रवाई करने से परोक्ष रूप से मिल सकनेवाले लाभों पर भी प्रकाश डाला गया है। कम कार्बनवाली अर्थव्यवस्था की दिशा में कार्रवाई में तेजी लाने के लिए एक अंतरराष्ट्रीय समझौता सभी देशों पर लागू होना चाहिए; इसकी निगरानी, रिपोर्टिंग, और जाँच करने के लिए एक सामान्य और सतत प्रणाली सम्मिलित की जानी चाहिए; और वैश्विक स्तर पर भारी आर्थिक प्रोत्साहन प्रदान किए जाने चाहिए।

At the International Monetary Fund, the focus is on reforming its member countries’ fiscal systems in order to raise more revenue from taxes on carbon-intensive fuels and less revenue from other taxes that are detrimental to economic performance, such as taxes on labor and capital.
The Group is leveraging its experience and global reach for learning and knowledge exchange through programs like the Partnership for Market Readiness.
That makes sense.
It is this moral aspect that makes care-givers, and at times even care-receivers, feel more “present” – and thus more fully human.
Care-giving, as illustrated by our case, includes what happens when hope and consolation are abandoned, when theodicy ends, and when all there is to do is to be present with the sufferer, sharing his or her suffering by simply – and usually silently – being there.
Doctors are no different from laypersons in drawing on personal and cultural resources –involving imagination, responsibility, sensibility, insight, and communication – to accomplish their care-giving.
TOKYO – The automobile – long a symbol of freedom, status, and success – is at a crossroads.
But safety is improving.
The auto industry can also make a vital contribution to the environment.
In 1999, Brazil, Russia, India, and China accounted for a mere 8% of vehicle sales worldwide; by 2012, their combined sales had reached a staggering 35% of the global total.
COPENHAGEN – For the better part of a decade, I have upset many climate activists by pointing out that there are far better ways to stop global warming than trying to persuade governments to force or bribe their citizens into slashing their reliance on fuels that emit carbon dioxide.
Of course, such a rise would not be a trivial problem. It would affect about 400 million people, force the relocation of 15 million, and imply costly protection of the rest.
For example, traffic accidents claim an estimated 1.2 million lives every year.
Perhaps it is because we experience the downside of excessive traffic regulation or security measures every day, while the downside of bad climate policy is more of an abstraction. It shouldn’t be, for the risks posed by bad climate policy deserve just as much attention as the risks of worse-than-expected climate impacts – maybe more.
The European Union has committed itself and its member states to increase aid flows to 0.56% of GDP by 2010 and 0.7% by 2015 − with a big focus on Africa.
It is an agenda for improved partnerships, reduced transaction costs, and increased efficiency.
Would dispensing aid by making cash transfers directly to the poorest work better?
It would certainly be costly, but not out of reach if African aid is doubled.
WASHINGTON , DC – China has weathered the Great Recession well.
One key idea was to lighten the tax burden on labor . Taking into account the personal-income tax and various social contributions, taxation of labor income in China is too high . To be sure, taxes are needed to finance social spending, but revenue sources other than taxes on labor income could do the job.
In addition, a comprehensive nationwide housing policy is urgently needed to ensure that housing remains affordable, particularly for those on limited incomes.
Distortions in key prices that favor capital-intensive manufacturing need to be removed by raising the cost of land, energy, water, and capital.
Tourism has been stagnant for decades, even as travelers have flocked to other Caribbean destinations.
For example, Puerto Rico is subject to the Jones Act, which requires using very costly US-built ships and crews for all sea transport to and from the mainland.
Successive Puerto Rican governments thought that the island’s economy was in “recession” and attempted to spur activity by increasing government spending.
Companies cannot compete with firms that pay much lower wage rates on neighboring islands.
Bills to make Puerto Rico eligible for Chapter 9 are being introduced in Congress.
The regime of former President Viktor Yanukovych was dancing to the Kremlin's tune, and my confinement ended only because of the courage of the millions of Ukrainians who demanded its ouster.
Simply trusting the Kremlin's “goodwill" would be reckless.
But the earthquake that Russia triggered in Ukraine has also exposed dangerous fault lines across Europe.
The continent's Euroskeptic political parties, on both the left and the right, are holding up Putin's authoritarian nationalism as a model for the type of illiberal regime they would seek to establish should the EU dissolve.
A West that is divided in this crisis cannot stand.
The real losers of the election were the Social Democrats, with a drop in support of 11% that is without precedent in the very stable history of German electoral behavior.  Some on the left claim that the SPD’s catastrophic result was the product of too close an engagement with liberalism and deregulation.  According to this view, the party is now paying the price for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s successful attempts at economic reform in the early 2000’s.  It seems more likely that the party was punished for its lackluster electoral campaign, and for the negativity with which it tried to present the outcome of the election (the center-right coalition) as a threat to social peace in Germany.

Indeed, Western journalists and news organizations seem to accept as a fact of life censorship within countries that routinely control the media.
It also explains why journalists in those countries have so often bent over backwards to apologize for individual transgressions, rather than stand in defiance.
We should consider the front pages of every free nation’s newspapers as a precious set of documents, to be replicated and shared openly throughout the world, especially in countries where heavy state censorship exists.
Weak, fiscally challenged governments, endemic corruption, struggling economics, and high levels of crime have made these three small countries difficult places to live.
In 2014, Honduras alone had more homicides than the 28 European Union member states combined.
The project is timely and well conceived, embodying the long-term approach that will be essential to bring about structural change and, one hopes, contain migration flows.
Central America needs help. But only change from within can ensure a future in which the region’s young people choose to build their lives at home.
Such was the scale of the necessary transition that neither modern macroeconomics, nor the International Monetary Fund’s nearly 50 years of experience, offered much guidance.
Financing from the IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and bilateral lenders, along with debt relief from official and commercial bank creditors, helped relieve the pressure.
Looking ahead, one can envision two broad scenarios.
The sudden death in late December of Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenistan’s authoritarian president-for-life who declared himself “Turkmenbashi” (Leader of all Turkmens), jeopardizes stability in a country that is an increasingly important supplier of energy to Europe.
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are also major exporters of natural gas.
In the long run, Russia and China are likely to be rivals for power and influence in Central Asia.
However, the political situation in Kyrgyzstan is far from stable. Discontent with President Kurmanbek Bakiyev’s rule is rising.
As Afghan President Hamid Karzai is said by his critics to be on the verge of casting his lot with Pakistan and the Taliban, the Pentagon has signaled its fear that the war may spread beyond the Pashtun heartland to the largely Tajik and Uzbek areas in the north of the country.
Unlike his neighbors, he opened the border to desperate refugees, mostly women, children, and the elderly.
Uzbekistan, which ought to welcome all the help it can get and probably doesn’t object to greater OSCE involvement in principle, is nonetheless dragging its feet, supposedly because of jealousy over all the attention Kazakhstan is gaining from its chairmanship.
That is something big to worry about, regardless of whether one is in government.
But, in order to coordinate energy strategies and strengthen energy security, last year the organization launched a club that unites energy-producing and energy-consuming states, transit countries, and private companies.
It has no rapid-reaction force and does not engage in regular political deliberations.
The EU has money and the SCO organization, most of whose members border Afghanistan, has trained personnel and direct experience in the region.
Consideration also needs to be given, therefore, to the establishment of a NATO-China Council, along the lines of the NATO-Russia Council, and to the creation of arrangements that would facilitate greater cooperation with the SCO as a whole.
This prompted the ECB Council to leave 80% of those bond purchases on the balance sheets of national central banks, where they will be the responsibility of national governments.
It follows that a consideration that ranks only fourth in terms of priorities should not be allowed to dictate policy.
The SNB's motive, it appears, was entirely political.
The same criticism applies to the loss-sharing arrangements that the ECB attached to its quantitative easing.
On the contrary, major central banks’ growth and inflation forecasts in the years since the financial crisis have consistently overestimated both growth and inflation – and by wide margins.
Moreover, the digital revolution in media has elevated the role of business news, one of the few profit centers for print and broadcast journalism in many countries.
This makes policy opinions that come straight from the horse’s mouth almost uniquely valuable.
The Trouble With Financial Bubbles
It is fair to say that the debate has moved on a little since 2008.
At the Lima meeting, the traditionalist counterview came from Benoît Cœuré of the European Central Bank.
And, if all else fails to achieve financial stability, central banks could change interest rates.
CHICAGO – Poor Ben Bernanke!
The answer lies in their view of the root cause of continued high unemployment: excessively high real interest rates.
First, while low rates might encourage spending if credit were easy, it is not at all clear that traditional savers today would go out and spend.
If these debt-free savers are in New York City, which did not experience as much of a boom and a bust, cutting real interest rates will encourage spending on haircuts in New York City, which already has plenty of demand, but not in Las Vegas, which has too little.
Clearly, improving indebted households’ ability to refinance at low current interest rates could help to reduce their debt burden, as would writing off some mortgage debt in cases where falling house prices have left borrowers deep underwater (that is, the outstanding mortgage exceeds the house’s value).
The Czech Republic has a strong record of supporting free expression, curbing surveillance, and promoting transparency, but Hungary persecutes bloggers and publishers with heavy fines and other sanctions.
Legislation must to be modernized to reflect developments in the online world and to recognize the enormous shift in personal communication and news delivery. In Slovakia, online journalists do not enjoy the same legal protection as print journalists.
And yet, in the meantime, Poland's foreign ministry has not made Internet freedom a priority.
Yet Poland, like many of the other new democracies in our region, remains stuck in the past when it comes to the humane treatment of drug users.
In Hungary, for example, the penal code calls for two years imprisonment for personal possession by a drug-dependent person.
In a step forward, a debate in the Polish parliament on the proposed drug law is set to start in September.
Nor would internal reforms work, because the Soviets would intervene to save the system, as they did in 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
A whole generation felt that the moment had come when Hungarians could at last determine their own future.
But Europe must nonetheless recognize the need to distinguish clearly between partners, competitors, and opponents, and to formulate a more sophisticated and articulated policy towards Russia, in particular.
The question for the European elite is whether we believe in the work of the past 20 years, whether we believe in an integrated European market and an ever-widening European Community.
यह प्रवृत्ति आंशिक रूप से मातृ मौतों को कम करने के प्रयासों की सफलता को दर्शाती है। 1990 से, महिलाओं की प्रसव के कारण होनेवाली मौतों की संख्या लगभग आधी होकर 2,89,000 प्रति वर्ष हो गई है। तथापि, उसी अवधि के दौरान, गर्भाशय ग्रीवा के कैंसर से होने वाली वार्षिक मौतों में लगभग 40% की वृद्धि होने से इनकी संख्या 2,66,000 हो गई है। हालाँकि देखभाल के बेहतर स्तरों के कारण मातृ मृत्यु दरों में कमी होती जा रही है, गर्भाशय ग्रीवा के कैंसर से होने वाली मौतों में और बढ़ोतरी होने की संभावना है। 2035 तक, इस बीमारी के फलस्वरूप हर वर्ष 4,16,000 महिलाओं के धीरे-धीरे और दर्द से मरने की संभावना है - लगभग ये सभी मौतें विकासशील देशों (ज्यादातर उप सहारा अफ्रीका और दक्षिण एशिया) में होंगी।
अमीर देशों में, एचपीवी टीकों की कीमत अक्सर प्रति खुराक 100 डॉलर से भी अधिक रखी जाती है। लेकिन वैक्सीन एलायंस, गावी ने निर्माताओं को विकासशील देशों में इसकी कीमतों को कम रखने के लिए राज़ी किया है। हाल ही में, हमने एचपीवी के टीकों के लिए अब तक की सबसे कम कीमत $4.50 प्रति ख़ुराक हासिल की है, जिससे 27 देशों में उन सबसे गरीब लाखों लड़कियों के लिए अवसर खुल गए हैं जिन्हें यह टीका लगाया जाना है। हमारा अनुमान है कि 2020 तक, गावी द्वारा 40 से अधिक विकासशील देशों में 30 मिलियन से अधिक लड़कियों की एचपीवी से रक्षा के लिए टीका लगवाने में मदद की जा चुकी होगी।

The opposition is now represented mostly by professional democratic politicians who not only united a wide group of factions, but also displaced the “Salvadores de la Patria” (the Nation’s Saviors) – a group accustomed to leading the opposition from the reception rooms of the capital’s hotels.
Indeed, the shadows of militarism that have appeared over the Chávez regime may well have unnerved a majority of Venezuelans, who wonder who the next adversary to be pursued will be.
वाशिंगटन, डीसी - एक लंबे समय तक, पहले कॉलेज के प्रोफेसर के रूप में और उसके बाद भारत सरकार के मुख्य आर्थिक सलाहकार के रूप में, मैं वैश्विक गरीबी पर विश्व बैंक के आंकड़ों की प्रवृत्तियों पर नज़र रखने और विभिन्न देशों में उनके स्वरूपों का विश्लेषण करनेवाला एक संतुष्ट उपयोगकर्ता था। मैं शायद ही कभी यह सोचने के लिए रुका हूँगा कि उन संख्याओं की गणना किस तरह की जाती है। फिर, तीन साल पहले, मैंने विश्व बैंक में इसके मुख्य अर्थशास्त्री के रूप में पदभार ग्रहण किया। यह मानो उस ग्राहक की तरह था जो अपने पसंदीदा रेस्तरां में मस्ती से रात के खाने के लिए ऑर्डर दे रहा हो और उसे अचानक रसोई में जाकर भोजन तैयार करने के लिए कहा जाए।



Higher food prices meant that poor people, already struggling to meet basic human needs, were pushed deeper into poverty.
Many are malnourished or hungry.
In turn, this can spur sustainable non-farm employment growth in services, agro-processing, and small-scale manufacturing.
Given their central role not only as mothers and caregivers, but also as farmers, rural women hold the key to food security.
The possibility of military intervention in Syria, together with the deteriorating situation in Egypt since the army’s coup, has placed the region on a razor’s edge.
The civil war in Syria, meanwhile, has inflamed the Sunni-Shia fault line that traverses the entire region, and that defines, for example, the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
That is a grave mistake, because progress in the negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would create a more propitious climate for resolving the region’s other problems.
There is an expression in Iran that applies to the international community: “You can wake only someone who is sleeping, not someone who is pretending to be asleep.”
The general impression before the election was that Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei, supported either Saeed Jalili or Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf.&#160;In recent years, Jalili has been the leading Iranian representative in international negotiations over the country’s nuclear program.
Conservatives tried to convince their candidates to unite behind a single figure, but weaker candidates did not drop out in favor of a unity candidate.
When Ahmadinejad came to power, Rowhani lost his position as the Council’s secretary, but became Khamenei’s personal representative to it – a post that he has held until now.
Iran’s government can no longer claim that the nuclear program is a national cause with broad support.
So a great deal is at stake, both internally and externally.
The structural evolution that underpins growth will increasingly be driven by market opportunities and entrepreneurial initiative.
As the scope of the private sector expands, legal structures and policies that support competition, entry and exit, market openness, intellectual property, and social safety nets will also be needed.
No longer.
Designing that system will be an important part of achieving the high-return investment and expanded consumption that Chinese leaders want – and that China’s economy needs.
Yet the United States has refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, which does little to change the long-term course of events on the planet, since it calls for only small steps up to the year 2012.
Solar power is plentiful but not cheap.
There is strong evidence, however, that it would not cost the world huge amounts to undertake large-scale carbon capture and storage.
Let’s press our governments to make real progress when they meet; otherwise they will merely be adding to the problem.
Kini, mereka secara bertahap mengambil tindakan untuk menghapuskan subsisi, mengikuti harga pasar, dan meningkatkan efisiensi – jenis kebijakan yang biasanya diasosiasikan dengan negara-negara pengimpor minyak.
Risikonya adalah perubahan-perubahan yang cepat ini akan menyatu dengan geopolitik yang tidak stabil untuk memicu kemunduran dari pasar energi global.
Seiring dengan Uni Eropa merevisi baik kebijakan energi maupun kebijakan luar negerinya, Uni Eropa sebaiknya tidak melewatkan kesempatan untuk mengintegrasikan dialog kebijakan energi terbuka ke dalam rencananya.
Concentrated in coastal China, this model produced an uneven distribution of output and established a unique pattern of high savings and low consumption.
This implies the need to upgrade China’s industrial structure, accelerate the formation of human capital, facilitate technological progress, and undertake further institutional reforms.
And yet the high volume and inferior quality of these assets have also posed challenges to the country’s ability to complete the transition from trade power to financial power, and thus to exploit the competitive advantages of Chinese capital.
They also have sanitation and safe drinking water.
Of course, some nations do better: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg all exceed the United Nations target of allocating the equivalent of 0.7% of gross national income in foreign aid.
That is not a good basis for future cooperation between rich and poor countries on issues such as climate change.
The Twitter hashtag #killallMoslems has been around since 2011.
And, given the fear campaign propagated by Al Qaeda and its affiliates, on the one hand, and right-wing racists, on the other, many people are unaware that Muslims are actually a very small minority in all European (and Western) countries.
Unfortunately, as the horrific murder of 77 people by Anders Breivik in my adopted country of Norway has shown us, it only takes one organization or one individual to commit an atrocity, whatever a society’s level of education and living standards.
No one should presume that European Muslims must apologize or explain the actions of a terrorist organization with a cult-like religious ideology, just as no one expected Norwegians to apologize for Breivik.
In 2005, when I was Prime Minister of Denmark, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten provoked international controversy by publishing twelve sketches of the Prophet Muhammad.
And, in democracies, you can always take the matter to court.
Others decided not to.
The march of millions in Paris on January 11 was a magnificent expression of solidarity and peace.
And I fully understand the desire to purchase the subsequent issue of Charlie Hebdo, published – with bravery and determination – a week after the attack. People not just in France, but around the world, want to show their solidarity with the victims and support the fundamental principle of free speech.
But people can choose to avoid speech that others will hear as blasphemy.
I worry for our world.” Mobilizing mass demonstrations around whether you “are” or “are not” Charlie Hebdo invites demagoguery from extreme factions in all societies that gain from fueling sectarian conflict.
Achieving lasting change, however, requires addressing not just the consequences of extremism but also its root causes.
This means that it is up to our education systems to intervene early to help the connected generation interact safely in today’s digital world.
Such visible demonstrations of defiance in the face of violence strengthen ties between communities and can prevent the division that extremists try to generate.
Rather, it means identifying and backing those groups whose anti-extremist messages resonate with the intended audience.
In both cases, what seems desirable appears highly improbable.
According to this logic, the “undecided” are actually leaning toward Capriles, and if their number is larger than Chávez’s margin in the polls, the caudillo will lose.
The predictable suspect is former Colombian president Álvaro Uribe.
That is a great pity.
Conversely, every global recession in the past 50 years has been preceded by a sharp increase in oil prices.
But if growth is likely to accelerate next year in oil-consuming economies such as China, what explains plunging oil prices? The answer lies not in China’s economy and oil demand, but in Middle East geopolitics and oil supply.
To find buyers for all this extra oil, roughly equal to the extra output produced by the US shale revolution, Iran will have to compete fiercely not only with Saudi Arabia, but also with Iraq, Kazakhstan, Russia, and other low-cost producers.
यह कल्पना करना मुश्किल है कि भारत के चौथे सबसे बड़े शहर के स्कूल, कॉलेज, आईटी कंपनियाँ, कारखाने, और व्यावसायिक प्रतिष्ठान ठप पड़ गए हैं।  और यहाँ तक कि फ़ोर्ड, डेमलर, बीएमडब्ल्यू, और रेनॉल्ट जैसी वैश्विक कंपनियों ने अपने स्थानीय कारखानों में उत्पादन ठप करने का अभूतपूर्व निर्णय ले लिया है।  चेन्नई का प्रतिष्ठित समाचार पत्र द हिन्दू, 178 साल में पहली बार इसका मुद्रित संस्करण इसलिए नहीं निकाल पाया क्योंकि इसके कर्मचारी काम पर नहीं आ पाए थे (हालांकि इसने साहसपूर्वक इसका ऑनलाइन संस्करण तैयार कर लिया)।


Studies are still under way into elevated rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease among the “liquidators” who worked at the reactor site in the months following the accident.
In part, this is because the initial Soviet response was secretive: Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet leader at the time, addressed the issue on television only weeks later, on May 14, 1986.
Some NGO’s and Chernobyl charities have responded with disbelief, citing as evidence the general population’s admittedly poor health.
The children of Chernobyl are all grown up; their interests, and those of their own children, are best served not by continually evoking the nightmare of radiation, but by giving them the tools and authority they need to rebuild their own communities.
With a strong commitment, any country or institution can build it.
Indeed, the amendment not only lacks a clear definition of who belongs in this category; it also fails to identify who will make such decisions.
As Ellen Lutz and Caitlin Reiger have pointed out, “the waxing and waning of political fortunes still dominates the extent to which former leaders are held judicially accountable for their crimes at all.”
Critics should give it time to be tested – and, if necessary, amended – before they condemn it.
Given the huge impact of obesity on health-care costs, life expectancy, and quality of life, it is a topic that merits urgent attention.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 18% of children aged 6-11 in the US are not just overweight, but obese.
And, in the short term, any income effects could be offset by increased transfers.
Children’s Champions
But a worldwide counter-offensive is now underway.
These young activists may not yet be trending on Twitter or Facebook, or even be household names in their own countries, but support for their cause is growing fast.
The organization A World at School is now circulating the biggest-ever petition in support of the Millennium Development Goal of universal education.
Museums, gardening, clubs of all sorts are blossoming in today’s France.
But it also seeks protection from the dizzying effects of globalization, which probably will mean strong support for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, skepticism toward further trade liberalization and the will to improve European Union’s economic government.
So make no mistake about it. Nicolas Sarkozy has not been elected to adapt France to an elusive globalization.
So why should now be different?
Yet a third wall remains, less visible than the others but just as harmful, if not more so.
As Chile deepens its integration with the world, we are also moving forward with structural reforms through which we will be able to improve substantially the quality of education received by millions of our children and youths; retrain three-quarters of Chilean workers over the next four years; grant universal access to broadband Internet service; double our investment in science and technology; promote innovation and entrepreneurship in the public and private sectors; and reduce the time needed to start up a company to one day – and the cost to zero.
Although the government owns Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, it is Chile’s only publicly owned company.
The government mandates the range of investment strategies, which vary in terms of the share of equities and fixed income that companies may offer.
On average, young people spend an average of 15 years in school from primary through tertiary education.
Even Bachelet’s critics agree that Chile’s basic macroeconomic policies will not change: an independent central bank committed to price stability, a free-trade regime with a floating currency, and a fiscal policy that will keep deficits and public debt low.
With no fees and an entrance system based entirely on merit, students from middle- and working-class families comprise the vast majority of the student body.
By selecting only the strongest students, critics claim, they ensure strong results, without having to add a lot of value.
The Bronx High School of Science in New York City takes children of immigrants and molds them into some of the world’s leading scientists.
It is no coincidence that many of Chile’s democratic reformers of the last two centuries were once students at the Instituto Nacional.
Between 1990, when democracy was restored, and 2010, Chile experienced rapid economic growth, more than tripling its per capita income and making it possible to reduce poverty with targeted, highly efficient policies.
During those 20 years, including 1990-1998, when Pinochet remained the army’s Commander-in-Chief, his right-wing allies retained the ability to veto legislation. Thus, despite the old right’s minority popular support, progress required compromise on many issues, including laws that favored genuine democracy, in order to win the agreement of appointed senators, most of whom defended Pinochet’s institutions.
These are the citizens who are in the streets, who demand change and reject neo-liberalism, with its deregulation and failure to protect the vulnerable from abuses of power.
So far, nothing new: the RN and the UDI – which differ mainly in their attitude towards the military government from which they emerged (the RN being the more self-critical) – have been the main challengers in all the previous elections.
Frei’s lackluster numbers reflect his own weaknesses (he is notoriously uncharismatic and was the least popular of the four Concertación presidents), as well as the inevitable stress that two decades of uninterrupted rule has placed on the ruling coalition.
These policies are popular with voters, and they are protected by powerful actors (for example, the strong export-oriented business sector) and by trade agreements with almost all the world’s major economies and regional blocs.
But we can gain greater purchase on it by considering three other questions.
Whether China can develop and implement a viable new economic-growth model in post-crisis conditions depends on whether President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang can revive the legacy of their predecessors, Deng Xiaoping and Zhu Rongji. In other words, China’s future – and that of the global economy – depends on how committed its leaders are to overcoming vested interests and pursuing comprehensive structural and policy reform.
Asia’s middle-class population is expected to experience explosive growth in the coming years, rising from 500 million people in 2010 to 1.75 billion in 2020.
Beside it is the stunning “water cube,” or Aquatics Center, of Chinese/Australian design.
China’s leaders fear that if they begin to pronounce on the domestic record of other nations, much less join in sanctions or United Nations peacekeeping missions, they will help establish a precedent that would allow others to intrude on domestic Chinese affairs.
Hu and Wen have cancelled national agricultural taxes, made rural schooling free, launched a new rural medical insurance plan, and guaranteed that, since there is still no title for holding private agricultural land, peasants are entitled to renew their long-term leases.
SHANGHAI – In March of last year, the first session of China’s 12th National People’s Congress began with then-Premier Wen Jiabao delivering his tenth and final “report on the work of the government.” When he had finished, the 3,000 representatives in attendance gave him a resounding ovation that was surely a response to more than the report; it was a display of praise and respect for his achievements as the head of China’s government.
But there is more to assessing Wen’s stimulus than the growth/reform trade-off.
In the coming years, China’s engagement with the developing world will continue to deepen. The National People’s Congress has discussed using a portion of China’s foreign-exchange reserves to finance infrastructure projects in developing countries.
As policymakers draw up the country’s 13th five-year plan, they will grapple with a fundamental question: How fast can China expect to grow?
The larger the gap in per capita income, the larger the latecomer advantage and the greater the potential for growth.
The country suffers no lack of investment opportunities, with significant scope for industrial upgrading and plenty of potential for improvement in urban infrastructure, public housing, and environmental management.
As a result, Chinese growth is likely to fall below its potential of 8% a year.
Obviously, the AIIB runs this risk.
With its penchant for constant experimentation and improvement, one might even hope that China will draw lessons and apply them to all of its developing-country lending.
Headline aid numbers might seem less impressive, but long-run results would be better.
We should evaluate the AIIB by how it chooses and fosters projects, not just by how much financing it provides.
In fact, America’s opposition to the AIIB is inconsistent with its stated economic priorities in Asia.
The problem is a financial system that has excelled at enabling market manipulation, speculation, and insider trading, but has failed at its core task: intermediating savings and investment on a global scale.
Perhaps America’s opposition to the AIIB is an example of an economic phenomenon that I have often observed: firms want greater competition everywhere except in their own industry.
One hopes that other countries, both in Europe and Asia, will join as well, helping to fulfill the ambition that infrastructure improvements can raise living standards in other parts of the region, as they have already done in China.
In assessing America’s strength, China follows US debates on the merits of a uni-polar or a multi-polar world with keen interest.
Moreover, many EU members have simultaneously pledged their defense capabilities to NATO, which has been led by the US since its creation.
Second, the ESDP is concerned with good governance and institution building.
BERKELEY – Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao’s forthcoming trip to India, following hard on the heels of President Barack Obama’s recent visit, will provide another opportunity for the media to gush about the growing global economic clout of China and India.
Chinese growth is widely regarded as furiously export-driven, but domestic investment has in fact been the major component.
In the financial media, China and India have become poster children for market reform and globalization, even though in matters of privatization, property rights, deregulation, and lingering bureaucratic rigidities, both countries have in many ways departed from economic orthodoxy.
Indeed, there is some evidence that the overwhelming majority of multi-millionaires in China are relatives of high-ranking Communist Party officials.
Superficially, Russia and China may give the impression that they are pursuing the same path when they both proclaim with pride that they are “back” on the world stage.
For them, to say “Russia is back” means that the humiliating Yeltsin years are over, and that they now must be treated as equals, particularly by the United States.
As a result, the culture of physical violence and verbal provocation that is gaining ground in Putin’s Russia is deeply disturbing, whereas we tend to judge Chinese misdeeds with a greater sense of distance, if not indifference.
Moreover, to supply its Afghan forces, the US deepened its military footprint in Central Asia by renting the Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan, which also shares a border with China.
Muslim Uighurs from Xinjiang province were captured in Taliban training campus and jailed at Guantánamo Bay with other international terrorists from 2002 through 2009.
Indeed, China’s relations with Pakistan have assumed greater importance recently, owing to the tensions that now exist between Pakistan and the US.
From scientific research to identification of commercial applications of new technologies, progress has been achieved through trial and error.
They have been most effective when pursuing politically legitimate missions that transcend narrow economic calculation: social development, national security, conquering disease.
List noted how Britain’s emergence as “the first industrial nation” at the end of the eighteenth century depended on prior state policies to promote British industry.
Here is the moment of strategic uncertainty.
England’s rulers sought in vain to keep a lid on the greatest explosion of economic energy and financial wealth in human history.
China has played an important role in financing the US budget deficit in recent years, thanks to its effort to manage the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar.
As a result of concern about the global economy, the People's Bank reduced interest rates two weeks ago and joined the coordinated global interest rate cut on October 8 – the first time that China ever participated in a global monetary policy move.
Foreign exchange reserves are an immense $1.9 trillion.
HONG KONG – A consensus is rapidly emerging within China that the rule of law is the single most important precondition for inclusive, sustainable, and long-term peace and prosperity.
And the state must comply with its obligations in international law.
Will China be able to establish the rule of law as it is understood and practiced in the West and elsewhere in Asia?
Over the last few decades, the CCP has succeeded in building the hard physical infrastructure of a modern state, but the creation of the soft infrastructure – institutions and practices consistent with the rule of law and representative government – is only beginning.
A more credible concern is whether efforts to root out corruption weaken the incentive for government officials to promote growth.
So, while bribery in China may facilitate growth to some extent, it does not produce the kind of competitive business environment that supports long-term gains.
Consider Liu Zhijun, the former railway minister, who propelled China’s frenzy of high-speed rail construction.
She regarded her husband’s travails as a personal price paid for a greater good.
Since assuming his post, Xi has rapidly consolidated all of the main levers of power, elbowing aside his prime minister, the ineffectual Li Keqiang.
Xi plainly has no intention of changing China’s political culture, even though it leans against the task that he has set out to accomplish.
The Cold War and the period of US global dominance after 1989/1990 followed this pattern as well.
Otherwise, though, the transformation of China’s economy and society will be all-important, because the regime’s stability depends on it.
In foreign-policy terms, China will attempt to protect its domestic transformation by securing resources and access to foreign markets.
तथापि, चीन की आर्थिक तेज़ी को देखते हुए, यह वितर्क मान्य होने लग गया है कि दमनकारी राजनीतिक प्रणाली विकास के लिए अधिक अनुकूल होती है। हालांकि चीन का हाल ही का प्रदर्शन शानदार रहा है, लेकिन भारत का मॉडल दीर्घावधि में बेहतर सिद्ध होगा।
भारत में इस प्रश्न पर 40 साल पहले बहस हुई थी जब तत्कालीन प्रधानमंत्री इंदिरा गांधी ने आपातकाल की घोषणा की थी। उन्होंने नागरिक स्वतंत्रताओं को समाप्त कर दिया, विपक्षी नेताओं को जेलों में बंद कर दिया, और प्रेस को सेंसर कर दिया, यह सब इस विश्वास पर आधारित था कि लोकतंत्र ने भारत के विकास को अवरुद्ध कर दिया है। यह मामला 1977 में उस चुनाव के होने पर सुलझ गया जिसमें इंदिरा गांधी सत्ता से बाहर हो गईं और लोकतंत्र बहाल हो गया।

CAMBRIDGE – What impact will China’s slowdown have on the red-hot contemporary art market? That might not seem like an obvious question, until one considers that, for emerging-market investors, art has become a critical tool for facilitating capital flight and hiding wealth.
Yet it is not even the highest sale price paid this year.
But doesn’t China have a regime of strict capital controls that limits citizens from taking more than $50,000 per year out of the country? Yes, but there are many ways of moving money in and out of China, including the time-honored method of “under and over invoicing.”
The Chinese hardly invented this game.
Moreover, prominent human-rights lawyers have been jailed; the well-known free-speech advocate Pu Zhiqiang, for one, has already been held for over six months, while prosecutors attempt to build a case against him.
One hopes, for China’s sake, that it does not.
With fewer opportunities to attend conferences abroad, publish papers in Western academic journals, or spend time teaching or conducting research outside of China, their professional development and careers could be severely impaired.
The tens of millions of students who remain in China would not gain the knowledge and skills needed to maintain, much less improve, the economy’s global competitiveness.
As China enrolls countries as members of its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and doles out billions of dollars of aid during state visits abroad, some observers worry that, when it comes to soft power, China could actually be taking the lead over countries like the United States.
Two major factors limit China’s soft power, as measured by recent international polls.
In today’s media landscape, information is abundant.
Marketing experts call this “stepping on your own message.”
Most Western commentators continue to over-simplify this debate, framing it in terms of the proverbial China hard-landing scenarios that have been off the mark for 20 years.
Urban job growth averaged slightly more than 13 million in 2013-14 – well above the ten million targeted by the government.
While progress on economic rebalancing is encouraging, China has put far more on its plate: simultaneous plans to modernize the financial system, reform the currency, and address excesses in equity, debt, and property markets.
The challenge is to prioritize that will in a way that keeps China on the course of reform and rebalancing.
But none of these proved a serious obstacle to China’s long boom.
China’s government never believed that it should leave what happens in the economy solely to the market.
Thus, policymakers have ample room to maneuver if anything should go wrong.
China played little part in the global derivatives markets, and does not have much toxic securities to clean up or banks to save in order to unfreeze credit flows.
The good news is that China recognizes how much it has benefited from the marketization and openness of the past 30 years.
One possible explanation for the divergence between credit and GDP growth is that potential growth has already dropped to 7%.
The problem stems from the CN¥4 trillion ($660 billion) stimulus plan that the government launched in 2008, which fueled the creation of about CN¥14 trillion worth of credit – and supported a rapid increase in fixed-asset investment, especially in infrastructure and real-estate development.
Though China’s high national savings rate means that it does not have to borrow liquidity from abroad or print large amounts of money, the risks it faces should not be underestimated.
With the central government enjoying such favorable fiscal conditions – its debt-to-GDP ratio stands at only about 20% – now is the ideal time to initiate a much larger debt-swap program.
China’s economy is caught in the crossfire of structural and cyclical&nbsp;headwinds. Structural pressures have&nbsp;arisen from the shift to a new model of services- and consumer-led growth, and cyclical pressures stem from&nbsp;a tough global environment that has&nbsp;put downward pressure on the old model of&nbsp;export and investment-led growth.
A year ago, at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Xi and his team created the country’s most ambitious economic-reform agenda in 35 years.
The last thing China needs is more fiscal stimulus.
After all, China’s vulnerability to such risks is rooted in its old growth model, which was allowed to remain in place for far too long.
The result can be a deep depression.
The private sector, too, built up debt, with its limited access to equity capital driving firms to the shadow banking sector.
Recognizing this, some argue that the way to force reform is to allow interest rates to reflect credit risks.
China’s Dangerous Digital Agenda
Moreover, China employs technology standards as a market barrier, while using its anti-monopoly laws to harass US and European companies. Add to that the theft of valuable European and American intellectual property, including through the government-backed hacking of European companies' computers, and the threat that China poses to open competition could not be clearer.
Many foreign commentators condemned the devaluation as a blatant attempt to boost Chinese exports – a move that would, they warned, spark a new round of currency wars.
Indeed, China plans to shrink its trade surplus – which, to be sure, remains large – and offset the negative impact of that process by increasing domestic demand.
But this shift carries serious risks.
Neither side can afford to fail.
In the short run, this restructuring could lead to localized balance-sheet recessions, despite the authorities’ efforts to create a more accommodating macroeconomic environment.
Rising stock-market capitalization also helps to reduce the real economy’s exposure to bank financing.
Most of the credit went to real estate and local infrastructure projects, effectively reinforcing the most problematic trends in China’s economy.
That is why the real test of China’s administrative reforms is whether, through improved bankruptcy mechanisms and regulations that block fraud and market manipulation, they allow – and even facilitate – the effective functioning of market forces.
Indeed, China is now locked in a vicious economic circle, sustained by seemingly unrelated distortionary policies that are, in fact, deeply interconnected, even symbiotic.
Meanwhile, financial repression lowered the cost of capital.
Less efficient industrial sectors have accumulated significant excess capacity, destabilizing the entire economy, while more productive, efficient sectors lack access to the resources they need.
Whereas, according to Japan’s central bank, Japanese labor productivity grew by more than 10% annually, on average, from 1960 to 1973, Chinese productivity has been declining steadily in recent years, from 11.8% in 2001-2008 to 8.8% in 2008-2012, and to 7.4% in 2011-2012.
A better approach would focus on making economic growth more sustainable.
Still, China’s economy remains a source of significant uncertainty.
Although China’s growth rate still exceeds that of all but a few economies today, the scale of the slowdown has been wrenching, with short-run dynamics similar to a swing in the United States or Germany from 2% GDP growth to a 3% contraction.
With these goals in mind, China’s government recently engineered a modest currency devaluation – about 3% so far.
In addition, China must reduce administrative discretion, introducing sensible, predictable regulation to address natural monopolies and externalities.
China’s current economic slowdown was policy-induced.
The government has since reined in money-supply growth and started to impose limits on local governments’ borrowing.
As a result, China’s annual inflation rate soared to an all-time high of 24% in 1994.
The blockages used to be local governments and zombie real-estate developers.
At the forum, speakers, including the finance minister and the head of the central bank, summarize the Chinese leadership’s current thinking.
Although China’s total real GDP is second only to that of the United States (and might be larger when measured in terms of purchasing power), its per capita income is only about $7,000, or roughly 15% of the US level.
Environmental problems are another powerful drag on China’s current standard of living.
There was also no discussion of Chinese cyber theft of Western technology.
The finance ministry has raised the central-government budget deficit from 1.8% of GDP in 2014 to as much as 2.7% in 2015, and will allow highly leveraged local governments to swap CN¥1 trillion ($161.1 billion) of debt maturing this year for bonds with lower interest rates.
Because no economy had ever experienced such rapid growth on such a large scale, the only way to manage China’s development was, as Deng put it, to “cross the river by feeling the stones.”
This is not to say that it is all smooth sailing ahead.
Meanwhile, only 10% of total social funding comes from the equity market.
After six years of weighing the options, China is now firmly committed to implementing a new growth strategy.
This was emphasized by China’s new senior leaders – Executive Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli and Premier Li Keqiang – in the Forum’s opening and closing remarks, and considerable detail was provided in many of the working sessions.
In particular, owing to the hukou (China’s antiquated household registration system), access to public services and benefits is not portable.
Moreover, under the organizational umbrella of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) – the latter-day version of the old central planning apparatus – China has marshaled considerable resources into the formulation of a comprehensive and well-thought-out economic strategy.
Last year, the Fourth Plenum focused on leveling the economic playing field – in terms of rights, opportunities, and regulations – by strengthening the rule of law and improving the accountability, transparency, and legitimacy of government decision-making.
Moreover, China is moving forward with its “one belt, one road” initiative, aimed at deepening China’s economic ties with countries throughout Central and Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, and eventually Europe.
At the same time, China’s rulers must recognize that reforms have significant short-term deflationary effects.
Beyond reducing China’s dependence on external demand and helping to propel the country up the value chain, more spending in renminbi would help spur the use of renminbi in trade and investment.
More recently, the discussion has shifted toward a seemingly more credible cause: the proliferation of margin financing since 2010.
The CSRC, as China’s capital-market regulator, together with other regulators, neglected to fulfill their proper mission: to create a robust institutional framework capable of sustaining strong investment.
Yet, according to China’s recently announced draft Internet finance regulations, the country’s “1+3” regulatory model is to be retained.
The fear is that the recent stock-market crash may have spooked the government, causing it to slow the pace of reform, including efforts to open up China’s capital account.
The PBOC, through its “pledged supplementary lending” program, has also started lending directly to banks that have promised to use the funds for social housing construction.
The first factor driving up funding costs is the outsize profitability of China’s commercial banks – more than 23%, on average, for the top five last year – which account for some 35% of total profits earned by the 500 largest Chinese companies.
And, though it continues to guide interest rates on deposits, banks can easily evade these regulations by selling depositors off-balance-sheet wealth-management products, on which returns are not capped.
BERKELEY – On August 11, China devalued its currency by 2% and modestly reformed its exchange-rate system.
The rationale for this rule is straightforward: If foreign investors expect that more currency depreciation will follow, they will rush out of Chinese markets to avoid further losses.
The renminbi is already widely used to invoice and settle international merchandise trade, notably other countries’ trade with China itself.
Given that the SDR, which the IMF uses to keep track of its own financial transactions, is of little practical importance, the Chinese authorities’ effort to add the renminbi to it amounts to little more than a vanity project.
In the last year, Turkey has spearheaded a new accountability framework for efforts to boost growth in the G-20 countries.
Specifically, the AIIB will (among other things) provide funding for China’s ambitious “one belt, one road” policy, which aims to enhance trade linkages throughout Asia, across the Middle East, and into Europe, through massive infrastructure investment.
Given this, China could, like Turkey, use its G-20 presidency to promote consensus on the need to end the Syrian conflict and to support long-term peace and economic development throughout the Middle East by pursuing strategies that revive trade, investment, and employment.
It was a highpoint for American leadership.
But other infrastructure-related opportunities beckon.
To be sure, the IMF rejected this proposition in 2011, because the renminbi did not yet meet the criteria of a freely convertible currency.
That should give China’s leaders much to consider in the coming months.
The US Congress has yet to ratify a 2010 agreement providing China and other large emerging economies greater voting power in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
For anyone who wants to engage in global trade, it is thus vital to identify what China wants.
The US would be wise to not oppose such a move.
In a sense, this shift should not be surprising, given the widespread debate over the inherent weaknesses of existing international institutions and governance structures – in particular, China’s disproportionately small role in them. China accounts for a 3.8% voting share of the IMF and a 5.5% share of the ADB, compared to 16.8% and 12.8%, respectively, for the United States and 6.2% and 12.8% for Japan.
While the project could have significant regional benefits, stimulating economic development by promoting integration and connectivity, it would serve primarily China’s interests, expanding the country’s international influence and reducing the gap between its eastern and western regions. At the same time, it could exacerbate geopolitical tensions and territorial disputes between China and its neighbors.
According to the IMF, China’s GDP will be $17.6 trillion in 2014, outstripping US output of $17.4 trillion.
African leaders view China as their countries’ new indispensable growth partner, particularly in infrastructure and business development.
The New Silk Road land belt seeks to connect China with the economies of East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, and Europe through an expanded grid of rail, highways, power, fiber, and other networks.
Even worse, as China flexes its geopolitical muscles, the only foreign policy that the US systematically pursues is unceasing and fruitless war in the Middle East.
Economic growth, of course, has never been linear in any country.
First, local governments influence a large proportion of investment decisions.
Relentless extraction is quickly depleting China’s resource deposits.
Indeed, while China’s living standards have risen dramatically over the past 30 years, the gap between rich and poor has widened sharply.
Under China’s current institutional arrangements, meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance.
China’s Debt Termites
As a result, the foundations of China’s growth miracle are steadily being eroded by a debt overhang that shows few signs of receding.
In early 2015, the central government announced plans to convert the local governments’ short-term, high-interest bank loans into long-term bonds.
The drag on the economy will increase as resources continue to be diverted toward keeping inefficient firms alive.
Relative to the size of China’s foreign debt and the sheer volume of money that could go abroad, even its $3.7 trillion in foreign reserves starts to look puny.
For years, with the authorities’ encouragement (or at least acquiescence), China’s securities companies spared no effort in pumping up China’s stock exchanges with fashionable financial instruments and practices, the sole aim being to realize capital gains from rising prices (dividends are rarely distributed).
First, as plummeting stock prices caused the equity in investors’ accounts to fall below the maintenance margin, brokers began issuing margin calls, forcing investors to offload more assets to come up with the needed cash.
But the policy failures fueling this stock-market fiasco go back further, to the massive government-fueled surge in credit since the global financial crisis.
But in today’s deflationary environment, typical monetary expansion alone can do little to help the real economy, because the money either remains idle or fuels asset bubbles and capital outflows.
That said, as China undergoes structural economic transition, the stabilization potential of macroeconomic policy is limited.
Sementara itu produksi energi yang berasal dari sumber energi bahan bakar non-fosil meningkat 19%.
Tahun lalu merupakan kali kedua ketika Tiongkok menambah kapasitas produksi dari sumber energi bahan bakar non-fosil dibandingkan dengan bahan bakar fosil.
Jumlah investasi energi menuju produksi energi terbarukan kini terus-menerus meningkat dan mencapai 50% pada tahun 2011 dan menunjukkan kenaikan dibandingkan empat tahun sebelumnya ketika masih 32%.
The latest year-on-year data, from January, highlight the danger.
The authorities' task now is to determine how to support continued growth on the better performing track (the private sector and the first- and second-tier cities), while eliminating overcapacity and boosting productivity on the weaker track (SOEs and third- and fourth-tier cities).
For example, when the PBOC cut its benchmark interest rate last November, in order to help reduce private-sector borrowing costs, it triggered a speculative stock-market boom.
But the news is not all bad: a substantial portion of the economy continues to expand, underpinning much higher overall growth rates than in most other economies.
China’s Not-So-New Not-So-Normal
But there is nothing normal about an economy that is already twice as large as the next largest, Japan, and will possibly outstrip the European Union within the next five years.
After spending a few days in Beijing, it was abundantly clear that China is undergoing a boom in Internet use, including as a consumer platform. Online commerce is offsetting some of the other weaker areas of the economy, and its full impact might actually be underreported in official statistics.
Energy efficiency and renewable energy use are both on the rise as well.
In 2007, it established the National Leading Group on Climate Change (NLGCC), headed by Premier Wen Jiabao.
Fourthly, China has increased its carbon sinks by promoting reforestation.
In China’s view, the key to the success in Copenhagen lies in the realization of the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol (KP).
China in the Eye of the Beholder
Another selling point for Western executives is that many Chinese officials have engineering backgrounds, in contrast to their Western counterparts, most of whom are lawyers.
A third reason why Western businessmen get China wrong is that their admiration of the Chinese government is a reflection of their frustrations with their own governments.
Few Western executives understand the political consequences of their misperceptions.
Benar bahwa bahan bakar fosil telah menyumbangkan banyak keuntungan bagi dunia Barat dalam industrialisasi selama 200 tahun terakhir.
Setiap negara bisa menguatkan keamanan energinya dengan berinvestasi pada kapasitas industrial yang diperlukan untuk membuat turbin angin, sel surya/fotovoltaik, dan sumber-sumber energi terbarukan lainnya semaksimal mungkin.
Jika kita mampu menghindari bahaya terburuk akibat pemanasan di bumi, barangkali kita perlu berterima kasih kepada India dan Tiongkok.
The data show that China has built considerable strengths in industries fitting two of these archetypes: customer-focused and efficiency-driven.
To be sure, in engineering-based industries, Chinese companies have had some success.
Over the next ten years, China has a chance to move beyond merely absorbing and adapting global technologies to become a true innovation leader.
And, eventually, the Chinese model of innovation could become the global standard.
Specifically, the English and the Dutch created diverse political/economic units that evolved institutions nurturing specialization and division of labor.
For example, it has committed to ease market access by loosening entry requirements for both domestic and foreign investors.
This approach was fortified last summer, when despite serious market turmoil, the CCP upheld its commitment to allow the market to play a “decisive role in resource allocation.”
The Next Phase of China’s Financial Deepening

The second complication stems from the structural imbalance between the banking sector (or the debt market) and the stock market.
With shadow banks’ lending rates running as high as 20% annually, interest rates in the private credit market are already liberalized, with many SMEs able to cope.
If the real sector cannot deliver high returns to investors, there is no value creation.
A key element of China’s strategy is the recently established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and to some extent the BRICS’ New Development Bank, established last year by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
Chinese companies, in particular, will increasingly want to establish their brands internationally.
More important, as with China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, which required substantial reforms, fulfilling the conditions for joining the SDR promises to speed progress toward full capital-account liberalization – and thus toward a fully convertible renminbi.
China’s leaders surely want international recognition of their country’s global stature.
The case for a soft landing remains solid.
To be sure, the economy faces other headwinds, especially from the policy-induced cooling of an overheated housing market.
A McKinsey study estimates that by 2025 China will have more than 220 cities with populations in excess of one million, versus 125 in 2010, and that 23 mega-cities will have a population of at least five million.
Urban per capita income is more than triple the average in rural areas.
China’s Jobless Growth Miracle
The problem is that the manufacturing sector does little to create jobs, largely because relatively high productivity growth in the sector – averaging more than 10% annually over the last two decades – constrains demand for more workers.
Together, banks and the government provide about 35% of investment in SOEs, but only 10% of investment in private companies.
China’s Twin Challenges
Limited progress has already been made on this front: investment as a percentage of GDP has fallen slightly to 46% in 2014, while growth in retail sales and consumption have outpaced GDP growth.
Chinese policymakers now face a dilemma.
And, indeed, China has lately been employing just such an approach.
But financial repression becomes less feasible the more China liberalizes its capital account, because investors can simply move their assets abroad.
He knew that the shift from centrally planned egalitarian socialism toward market-oriented capitalism could destabilize the CCP’s rule, and the unequal accumulation of wealth in the short term could cause significant social and political division.
But the bureaucracy and its privileged networks benefited most, and a second, non-market source of inequality – endemic official corruption – became entrenched.
He is already working to eliminate graft, restrict the scope of administrative approvals, reduce the state-owned sector’s advantages, clarify property rights in land, and simplify welfare, tax, and financial regulations.
China’s recent relaxation of macroeconomic policy, despite ongoing market volatility, is an important step toward breaking unnecessary barriers to implementing the reforms needed to mitigate systemic risks.
Such revenues had risen at an average annual rate of 24% from 2009 to 2013.
And, given state intervention, interest rates do not adjust quickly enough to allocate resources efficiently.
But, in a country as large and diverse as China, a one-size-fits-all approach will not ensure that the market functions effectively.
As the central government consolidates its power through fiscal reform and an anti-corruption campaign, orchestrating the next phase of structural reforms at the local level will require deft coordination.
His arrest follows that of General Xu Caihou, who served on the commission from 2007 to 2012, in June of last year.
By contrast, when former President Jiang Zemin became General Secretary of the Communist Party following the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989, he was able to rely on capable and loyal officials in Shanghai to run the bureaucracy; he then expanded his support base by co-opting other factions in the 1990s.
To avoid the Soviet Union’s fate, Xi and his colleagues have re-imposed ideological control and curtailed civil liberties.
During his 31 years as prime minister, Lee crafted a unique system of government, intricately balancing authoritarianism with democracy and state capitalism with the free market.
In the last parliamentary election in 2011, six opposition parties won a total of 40% of the vote.
When China’s leaders cite the Singapore model, what they have in mind is limited to the perpetuation of their power.
MADRID – It is safe to say that the most consequential geostrategic development of the last two decades has been China’s rise.
Likewise, at the latest Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing, China spearheaded the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
The United Kingdom recently announced its intention to serve as a founding member of the AIIB, triggering a flood of applications from the likes of Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Korea, Russia, Turkey, and Spain.
In this sense, the participation of more European countries in the AIIB is a positive development, as it helps to ensure that the new bank complements, rather than rivals, existing institutions.
BEIJING – China is getting its exchange-rate adjustment whether it likes it or not.
The only difference in China is that the adjustment has been suppressed, so it is now coming abruptly.
Every high-growth, manufacturing-intensive Asian economy that has attempted it has suffered a massive slowdown.
Foreign firms that are carriers of innovative organizational knowledge and technology are barred from coming in.
CAMBRIDGE – I was in Beijing last month when the Chinese government released a preliminary summary of its 13th Five-Year Plan.
One of the key goals was set back in 2010: doubling real GDP and real personal incomes by 2020.
And President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption has had the side effect of delaying decision-making and inhibiting new projects.
China also has a variety of short-run problems.
The US seems to be settling into annual real (inflation-adjusted) growth rates of around 2%, though whether this is at or below the economy’s potential remains a source of heated debate.
Yet, in the aftermath of the global economic crisis, China insisted on maintaining extremely high growth rates of 9% for two years, by relying on fiscal stimulus, huge liquidity injections, and a temporary halt in the renminbi’s appreciation.
And there is every reason to believe that investment will remain high as the economy’s capital base expands.
Fortunately, Chinese households’ relatively low leverage means that the kind of balance-sheet damage that occurred in some advanced countries during the crisis, leading to a huge drop in demand, is unlikely, even if real-estate prices continue to decline.
Any fiscal stimulus now should focus on improving public services, encouraging consumption, and increasing household income.
Indeed, that was the theme of the just-concluded China Development Forum (CDF) – an important platform for debate among China’s senior officials and a broad cross-section of international participants that occurs immediately after the annual National People’s Congress.
In fact, China is far from settling in to a new normal.
In the meantime, China faces another, equally daunting challenge: the United States’ growing determination to contain its growing influence.
They receive instantaneous feedback from one another – especially on shared challenges – whether they like it or not.
Optimists emphasize its capacity for learning and rapid accumulation of human capital.
He was purposely vague in his response: the renminbi’s inclusion in the SDR would be a positive step, he said, but it could not be taken until China makes much more progress in reforming its financial sector and transforming its growth model.
As a result, China remains subject to US monetary policy.
In fact, 57 countries – including major powers like France, Germany, and the United Kingdom – have signed up as founding members, which may reflect a growing awareness of the US-dominated order’s diminishing returns.
The net effect is a growing capability of China’s strategic missile forces and military space platforms.
The reforms have been guided by two broad concepts: the “Four Mechanisms” – competition, evaluation, supervision, and encouragement – and yujun yumin, or identifying military potential in civilian capabilities, with defense industries integrating into the broader civilian economy.
China’s One-Child Calamity
Indeed, it is probably closer to six million per year.
And local officials in many localities explicitly threaten violators with other harsh punishments, including destruction of their houses and confiscation of their farm animals.
Outside observers often marvel at the CCP’s capacity to get things done – at least when those things are the construction of super-modern cities and a high-speed rail network.
Loans can range from CN¥100 ($16) to CN¥1 million, and target small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), as well as individual borrowers, that currently struggle to access credit through traditional institutions.
In a study of loan data from five Chinese banks, a team of researchers and I identified five factors that influence the emergence of non-performing SME and consumer loans. Some were fairly obvious: Larger loans and higher leverage ratios contribute to higher rates of NPLs.
Finally, platforms with business models that involve higher degrees of financial complexity must be watched carefully for misconduct, as they are the most likely to conduct proprietary trading without adequate expertise, or offer guaranteed returns without appropriate risk assessment and control. And, of course, financial interconnectedness demands international coordination of appropriate standards for the industry.
Indeed, America’s manufacturing industry has helped to drive its macroeconomic recovery.
One reason for the decline is that China has yet to absorb the production capacity created by large-scale investment in 2010-2011.
This trend will contribute to a more balanced global environment.
Chinese Coal Cuts
The government’s efforts to promote renewables are driven partly by growing pressure from middle-class Chinese, who are increasingly frustrated with pollution levels. Indeed, the environment is a hot topic in China today, exemplified by the response to the documentary film “Under the Dome,” which takes a critical look at air pollution and the role of the country’s coal and petrochemical companies.
The authorities should focus not only on producing renewable energy, but also on improving the energy efficiency of existing systems. As it stands, China’s economy is about three times as energy-intensive as America’s (a country that is not particularly energy-efficient itself).
China hopes to do the same, but it faces a distinctive challenge: its sheer size.
In response, China turned to the domestic growth engine of credit-financed investment in infrastructure and real estate.
As China’s construction frenzy ends, the economy is experiencing a major slowdown.
But, given that almost half of China’s rural workers are already over 50 years old, many may never migrate.
The good news is that wages are already growing faster than GDP – a trend that is likely to continue, as demographic change restricts the supply of new labor.
But many are basing their predictions on other economies’ experiences, whereas China has been breaking the mold on economic growth for the last three decades.
Lin argues that China can achieve 8% annual growth for another two decades, owing to its enduring “latecomer advantage,” which, among other things, entails rapid productivity gains brought about by technological catch-up with the United States.
Reforms in factor markets – labor, land, and finance – are essential.
This new round of SOE reform should be pursued diligently.
China’s Reform Stalemate
First, China’s powerful bureaucracy is disinclined to cede its powers in the name of liberalization and a shift toward a more market-oriented economy.
But the central government remains reluctant to make significant changes to the revenue-sharing model, wary not only of the effects on its coffers, but also of conferring more authority on local officials.
Though they will not oppose reforms outright, they will continue to procrastinate and spread fear about economic instability and social tension to prevent changes that threaten to diminish their status and prerogatives.
China’s situation, while far from dire, is certainly challenging.
When China’s problems became more widely apparent, investor confidence sank – and so did the stock market.
To some extent, the authorities seem prepared to do what it takes.
It is time to give private-sector players the tools they need to lead the economy toward more sustainable prosperity.
The new doctrine is “multipolarity” – the idea that the world is (or should be) made up of several distinctive poles of attraction.
Islam continued to spread across geographic and political boundaries.
As China’s labor costs rise, production is being re-located from the coastal regions to the western provinces.
The EEU is seen by its advocates as a step toward re-establishing the old Soviet frontiers in the form of a voluntary economic and political union, modeled on the EU – a project to take the sting out of the West’s “victory” in the Cold War.
Whether their marriage of convenience will lead to an enduring union – or, as George Soros predicts, a threat to world peace – remains to be seen.
The downgrade could, moreover, force the US Treasury to raise the interest rate on new bonds, in which case China would stand to gain.
If the PBC started to buy non-dollar assets in large quantities, it would invariably need to convert some current dollar assets into another currency, which would inevitably drive up that currency’s value, thus increasing the PBC’s costs.
Between 2001 and 2008, export growth accounted for more than 40% of China’s overall economic growth.
Unfortunately, given high inflation, structural adjustment has been postponed, with efforts to control credit expansion becoming the government’s first priority.
The story in Linyi is the kind of news that propaganda officials usually bury in the Communist Party’s secret files.
In July, having failed to elicit any government response, Chen began seeking legal aid from prominent lawyers to prepare lawsuits on behalf of the victims, causing alarm among local officials.
The village, too, is mysteriously without phone service.
This prospect is hardly encouraging. If abuses and repression in the provinces continue no matter how attentive the central government, or how assertive the press might have become, what then? 
Last year, the government said, there were 74,000 such incidents.
China’s Afghan policy is a case in point, but it also is a formidable challenge to the weiqi way.
China was also engaged in constructing a $500 million electric plant and railway link between Tajikistan and Pakistan.
Yet, however focused it is on soft-power projection in Afghanistan, China will likely find it difficult not to be drawn into the role of policeman in an extremely complex and historically conflict-ridden region.
It is inconceivable, though, that the Chinese would enter into the kind of massive US-style military intervention to which the world has grown accustomed in recent years.
Astutely, China has sought to place its African investments and diplomacy within the context of the old non-aligned movement and “Bandung spirit,” an era when many Africans viewed China as a brotherly oppressed nation, and thus supported efforts by the People’s Republic to gain a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, to replace Taiwan.
The level of Chinese FDI flowing into Africa at present is staggering.
Today, many African leaders pursue similar policies with China, which has struck bargains across Africa to secure crude oil, minerals, and metals in exchange for infrastructure built by Chinese companies.
Unless the Chinese mend their ways, the same fate awaits them in Africa.
(CPMIC), and China XinXing Import &amp; Export Corp. The agenda included not only these companies’ available weapons stockpiles, but also the Chinese firms’ promise to provide additional weapons if required.
Since 2000, China has actively courted Africa’s unstable and dictatorial countries with offers of aid and a refusal to back United Nations sanctions against them.
It was subject to UN sanctions until 2002.
But recently, two nurses and I ventured into a poor farming area, Nizui in Hubei Province, as part of a Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF) team to visit the Liu family and evaluate their 7-month-old baby.
Earlier this year, the government promised blood-products screening, free voluntary HIV testing, and free medicine for the poor.
Last month alone, they visited five large cities without success.
Patients who do receive care are often treated with substandard, even harmful, medicine.
Transforming promises and policies into patient rights, awareness, and effective health care will undoubtedly take time, especially for a country as massive and lacking in transparency as China.
At the summit’s end, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Singapore joined with Aquino in demanding that Hun Sen’s statement be amended.
Asia’s economies have, of course, become much more integrated in recent decades, particularly through production for global supply chains.
Indeed, the idea that Asian countries must choose between a Chinese or American future is false.
Such diplomatic realism need not lead to zero-sum outcomes, as the example of European integration demonstrates.
Indeed, the start of 2005 saw some movement on improved ties, with the introduction of a hugely successful lunar new year charter-flights program.
Missile tests, PLA military exercises and threatening rhetoric have been sufficient deterrents until now.
At the Chinese Communist Party’s congress in November, the new leadership was tasked with plotting the country’s path for the next ten years, which entails modernizing China’s social, political, and economic systems within the constraints of its history and changing geopolitical context.
These low-cost measures nurture long-term antifragility, while capturing future upside gains that could compensate for black swan events.
The situation began to improve in 1978, when Deng Xiaoping began to implement market-oriented reforms and open up the economy, giving China access to new opportunities for economic growth and employment.
And, notwithstanding corruption-induced fragility, the bureaucracy’s capacity to implement policy is sound.
The genius of China’s mini-move (allowing the Yuan to rise 2% against the dollar) is that no one can tell when or what is going to happen next.
Perhaps the speculative-inflow scenario will play out, but in slow motion.
It is a lot easier to exit from a fixed exchange rate regime when the pressures on the currency are upwards.
So should we expect to see much bigger currency moves in China anytime soon? Should we ever expect to see wild gyrations in China’s exchange rate of the sort one routinely sees in, say, the Australian dollar or the South African rand?
Things were not supposed to turn out this way.
Many American congressmen, for example, complain that American jobs are being destroyed by China’s intervention in currency markets to maintain an artificially low value for the yuan.
But, as America’s savings rate begins to rise, China’s export-led growth model, which has promoted employment in China at the cost of global trade imbalances, may no longer be possible.
Americans and others have been predicting decline regularly over the years: after the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957; again when Nixon closed the gold window in 1971; and when the American rust-belt economy seemed to be overtaken by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980’s. But when one looks at the underlying strength of the American economy, it is not surprising that the World Economic Forum ranks the US second (just behind Switzerland) among the most competitive, while China ranks some 30 places below.
BEIJING – Before the global financial crisis hit, critics of China’s economic imbalances – its twin fiscal and trade surpluses – mainly concentrated on the misallocation of resources that occurs when poor countries borrow from rich countries at high interest rates and lend the money to them at low interest rates.
But there is no guarantee that demand for these Treasury notes among foreign investors – including foreign governments – will be sufficient.
Despite China’s limited room for maneuver with regard to its stocks of foreign-exchange reserves, it should never give up its efforts to safeguard the value of its hard-earned wealth, which has been entrusted to the good will and supposedly responsible hands of the US government.
Hujin has already injected $60 billion of China’s foreign-exchange reserves into the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank.
Foreign banks could never hope to achieve such comprehensive coverage without a local partner.
In these circumstances, privatization will have profound consequences for China’s economy.
The transformation in China’s banking system is complex and difficult because it involves a change in its fundamental nature.
The model for Charter 08 was Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77.
In terms of its immediate impact, it is true that Charter 08 will hardly make a ripple in the pond of Chinese politics.
Japanese might revert to angry nationalism.
While the government might be able to crush such disturbances with force, a loss of confidence among the middle class would be more serious.
But the US – or at least Congress and the media – doesn’t get it.
Someday, of course, this will come to an end.
At the start of the process, China will have small and indirect ownership stakes in a great many US enterprises, and the odds are that the usual objections will be absent.
This March, I was in Chengdu, in Sichuan province, where many Tibetans live.
And that is what China’s government delivered in the last few decades.
Modernization should be carried out by self-governing people, not imposed by foreign force.
Historic monuments are being bulldozed everywhere in China in the name of development.
China’s Burma Test
With some international celebrities already keen to start a campaign to boycott the Beijing Olympics because of China’s support for some of the world’s most repressive and incompetent regimes, a military crackdown in Burma is the last thing the Chinese authorities can afford.
China’s national interest does not require it to prop up the Burmese junta forever.
China\u0027s Challenge to Latin America

Likewise, it develops five-year plans –and in many cases, such as in science and technology, plans that exceed 15 years.
Otherwise, relations between China and Latin America will be far from harmonious, even as their significance continues to grow.
Roughly 1.5 million of North Korea’s 23 million people are estimated to have starved to death over the past decade.
The permanent war footing is just one manifestation of North Korea’s obsession with rugged self-sufficiency.
Like Iran, however, Kim wants to have his cake and eat it: eventual acceptance as a nuclear power and all the economic enticements from the US, Europe, Russia, and China to de-nuclearize.
The result could be a new round of efforts by China to manipulate regional suspicion – or worse.
He replied, “The Brazilian economy has been doing well. But, whenever the government has extra money, President Lula likes to give tax rebates and subsidies to people, instead of using it on the roads.
This type of spending structure is nothing new to China.
Despite privatization, there are roughly 119,000 state-owned enterprises today, with a book value of about $4 trillion.
This can be done by putting these assets into national wealth funds and distributing the funds’ shares to citizens at no cost.
To correct this, China needs to boost its people’s sense of future financial security and affect a rise in private income commensurate with GDP growth.
While preparing for my first trip to China twenty years ago, George Orwell’s dark masterpiece, Nineteen Eighty-Four, seemed a useful lens through which to view this “people’s republic.”
After reading Nineteen Eighty-Four in 1949, the year of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, Huxley sent his former pupil a letter praising the novel.
Orwell’s Big Brother would not have been amused by this remark. But a member of Brave New World’s ruling elite would have taken it in stride.
But one would be wrong: studies have consistently shown that the rate of return to capital has been more than 10% since the late 1990s.
While the US banking sector is similarly concentrated, it has far more financial institutions – roughly 18,000 commercial banks, savings and locals associations, mutual savings banks, and credit unions, compared to only around 400 commercial banks and 3,000 rural credit unions and township banks in China.
Default rates in the informal sector are high, and lenders may disappear with depositors’ money, as happened in Wenzhou.
At a time when cyber attacks are increasing worldwide, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was right to declare that an attack on one nation’s computer networks “can be an attack on all.”
But, despite its corporate motto – “Don’t be evil” – Google itself was instrumental in aiding online censorship in China, having custom-built a search engine that purges all references and Web sites that the Chinese government considers inappropriate.
Cyber intrusion in peacetime allows the prowler to read the content and understand the relative importance of different computer networks so that it knows what to disable in a conflict situation.
It seems unlikely that these hackers, especially those engaged in cyber espionage, pilferage, and intimidation, are private individuals with no links to the Chinese government.
The Seoul Games in 1988 opened the door to South Korea’s democratization.
Moreover, he is a committed believer in non-violence, an admirer of the Dalai Lama, a disciple of the Mahatma Gandhi, and a sincere Buddhist.
Chen, a blind peasant and self-taught lawyer, had protested in 2005 against the kidnapping of some 3000 women in his hometown of Linyi.
When the Chinese leaders mention democracy in official declarations, they mean “organized” democracy, from the top down.
China’s government finally appears to be acknowledging the urgent challenges presented by the country’s aging population.
The elderly would thus account for a far greater share of China’s population than in other large emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Mexico.
But some foreign manufacturers, seeking to cap rising labor costs, are shifting production from China to cheaper destinations such as Vietnam, where average monthly wages for factory workers is $50-60 – half that of China.

Wen said that political reform, including opportunities for citizens to criticize and monitor the government, is necessary to sustain China’s breakneck economic growth. Otherwise, he argued, the country’s economic gains would be lost.
China's modest experiments with local elections have been supplemented by exercises in “deliberative democracy.”
Confucian-inspired intellectuals like Jiang Qing, for example, have put forward an innovative proposal for a tricameral legislature. Legislators in one chamber would be selected on the basis of merit and competency, and in the others on the basis of elections of some kind.
Unfortunately, the purchasing power of Europe’s dollars shriveled during the 1970’s, when the costs of waging the Vietnam War and a surge in oil prices ultimately contributed to a calamitous rise in inflation.
Europeans, who were called on to improve productivity and raise domestic demand, reformed their economies at a glacial pace, while China maintained its export-led growth strategy.
Yes, the Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy. But they will not worry too much about the next financial crisis when the aftermath of the current one still lingers.
A dollar crisis is not around the corner, but it is certainly a huge risk over the next five to 10 years.
Moreover, the two countries should harness each other’s comparative strengths and expand mutually beneficial cooperation in infrastructure, investment, and other areas; strengthen cultural ties to advance an expanding friendship; and enhance their cooperation in multilateral forums to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries in tackling global challenges.
So is “mistrust” between the two powers diminishing? The People’s Daily seems to consider bilateral relations as normal at this point.
China shares Russia’s suspicions in this regard; indeed, Xi proclaimed that, in terms of geopolitics, Russia and China “speak a common language.”
Ownership, however, is only one dimension of an economic system.
So further reforms will be decisive in determining the Chinese economy’s future performance.
Free media would also help.
The case for combining further government withdrawal from the production system with more engagement in the social field is compelling.
For Europe, Leijonhufvud argues, this implies a three-pronged approach that focuses on “levels of leverage,” “maturity mismatches,” and “the topology of the web,” – that is, “its connectivity and the presence of critical nodes that are ‘too big to fail.’”
Corporate contracts place the profit-oriented legal person at the center of the transaction and bind all of its stakeholders.
Following the physicist Fritjof Capra, one should regard living organisms, social systems, and ecosystems as an interconnected and interdependent, complex adaptive system.
China’s Excess-Capacity Nightmare
Based on the NDRC’s figures, 2008 capacity utilization rates were just 76% for steel, 75% for cement, 73% for aluminum, 88% for flat glass, 40% for methanol, and 20% for poly-crystalline silicon (a key raw material for solar cells).
In 2006, for example, the NDRC produced a list of plants that were required to cease operations by the end of the following year.
In many industries, neither market forces nor central planning are strong enough to bring about the “creative destruction” of inefficient producers.
In 1995-2010, when China’s average annual GDP growth rate was 9.9%, fixed-asset investment (investment in infrastructure and real-estate projects) increased by a factor of 11.2, rising at an average annual rate of 20%.
In the wake of the global financial crisis, Chinese banks were instructed to extend credit and invest in large-scale infrastructure projects as part of the country’s massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.
By the third quarter of 2012, industrial enterprises’ receivables totaled 8.2 trillion renminbi ($1.3 trillion), up 16.5% year on year, forcing many to borrow even more to fill the gap, which has driven up debt further.
China’s abrupt decision to raise the value of the renminbi (yuan) by 2.1% and to end its peg to the dollar comes after months of pressure from the US.
But China’s current situation is vastly different.
Although the expansion of exports has been dramatic, now accounting for 70% of China’s GDP, it has exerted no pull on other economic sectors, because it has been confined to foreign-owned manufacturing and assembling enterprises.
Now China is attempting to apply the same term to the Senkaku Islands in its dispute with Japan, and is perilously close to making the same claim for the entire South China Sea; indeed, some Chinese military officers already have.
Following Wen’s statement, the trilateral summit deteriorated.
The struggles for power within China’s ruling Communist Party over the purge of Bo Xilai, and the blind activist Chen Guangcheng’s escape from detention during economic talks with the US, have made Chinese leaders’ nationalist assertions even more strident than usual.
Europe also became nervous after the euro exchange rate rose to more than $1.40, far beyond the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate of $1.17.
In 2008 and 2009, the Chinese purchased US government bonds at a rate of $17 billion a month.
To be sure, the Chinese always restrained themselves from private real-estate financing in the US.
One need only recall the bidding for Emcore or Firstgold. The US wanted the Chinese money, but it was not prepared to offer anything more than structured securities of questionable creditworthiness, as well as government paper that is now clearly exposed to the risk of inflation and devaluation.
Policymakers in China seem to be unaware that many major cities have not had the luck to become financial centers. There is no economic or other theory that explains why a city called a “financial center” should be more valuable or lovely than others.
Instead, once financial transactions begin to concentrate in a place, it becomes hard to move them to other places.
The time has come to cast off the burden of building financial centers, and focus instead on advancing the modernization of Chinese finance.
The catalyst for these broad-based protests is the proposed construction of hundreds of dams throughout western China.
These protests are striking not only for the sensitive nature of the issues they address, but for the broad-based support they have elicited.
The same may happen in China.
The third option is to use environmental protection to justify moving China ahead with real political reform sooner rather than later.
To protect itself from the declining greenback, China and other countries are converting a portion of their accumulated dollar reserves into euros.

Note that it was French President Sarkozy who went to China to protest the currency peg, not German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The next meeting, later this year, of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum (CACF), established to promote trade and investment, will include 46 African heads of state, along with China’s leaders.
Trade figures tell a similar story of growing influence.
The fact that China, within a decade, has overhauled Africa’s balance of power, relegating the US and the UK to third and fourth place and challenging France for first place as the continent’s main economic and commercial partner, has irked these competitors.
Africa’s economy may grow, but Africans will continue to suffer.
Though such disparities can, of course, have other causes as well, geography does seem to explain a lot.
China’s central government has attempted this for the past 10 years through its “Western Development Program.”
If China’s authorities continue to encourage domestic migration, the problem of regional disparities will eventually be solved.
China’s Green Debt
China’s environmental problems, complex as the causes may be, can ultimately be attributed to our understanding of Marxism.
Although China has signed the Kyoto Protocol and some 50 other international environmental accords, we do little to honor them.
It is imperative that environmental factors figure in China’s macroeconomic planning in a real way.
They cannot limit themselves simply to “supervision” and appeals to the authorities.
China’s Happy Mask
The European Union may not be far behind; much will depend on how China presents its case over the coming 18 months as the two sides negotiate a wide-ranging Partnership Cooperation Agreement, which will determine the quality of bilateral relations for the next decade.
Yet it is almost certainly the sort of forecast of which they should beware.
Political leaders in EU capitals and the US may be well aware of China’s global economic importance, but the widespread public perception is that its factories are dirty and environmentally harmful.
They may also have the unintended benefit of shifting a key policy debate in a more productive direction.
All that has changed is that both countries have been downgraded to smaller roles on the world stage.
The World Bank has engaged in a good faith effort to make progress on a hugely complicated matter.
What China needs is a more flexible exchange rate that can respond freely to market forces.
The execution this week of the former head of China’s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), Zhen Xiaoyu, who accepted almost $1 million in bribes, shows that the frenzy has now seeped into China as well.
Roughly 75% of China’s food is now produced by small, private, and un-licensed operations that are difficult to regulate.
China’s mad rush toward fuqiang (wealth and power) has given it little chance to develop all the compensatory institutions that any truly developed, not to say enlightened, society needs to achieve equilibrium and social health.
China’s Inflation Muddle
Current inflation is more broad-based than it appears, regardless of the controversy surrounding the adequacy of China’s CPI basket in reflecting the reality of underlying price movements.
Changes in China’s financial conditions reinforce this view.
The most difficult period for Chinese decision-makers was between February and September 2008, when, despite abundant signs of a softening in domestic demand, overall demand remained strong, as did inflation.

China’s economic problems are more structural than cyclical.
Rather than heralding a new era of freedom, the Internet is enabling Chinese authorities to perfect totalitarian control in a way that puts the rulers in George Orwell’s 1984 to shame.
In a country where freedom of expression has been off limits for half a century, the Internet had at first proven to be a godsend: people poured their enthusiasm into it by building Web sites and personal homepages.
But not forever.
Similar downtrends are evident in a broad array of leading indicators, ranging from consumer expectations, money supply, and the stock market, to steel production, industrial product sales, and newly started construction.
Fears surfaced of another banking crisis, the imminent collapse of a monstrous property bubble, and runaway inflation.
Notwithstanding that problem, major imbalances in Chinese property markets should prove to be the exception over the next two decades.&#160; While there could be supply-demand mismatches in any given year, with an average of roughly 15 million citizens a year slated to move from the countryside to newly urbanized areas, demand should rise to meet supply.&#160; Meanwhile, there are encouraging signs that property inflation is now cooling: For 46 of 70 major Chinese cities, property prices either declined or stayed flat in August 2011 compared with 31 cities that reported similar conditions in July.
An increasingly unbalanced Chinese economy cannot afford persistent 10% GDP growth.
The China Daily recently ran a front-page story recounting how Paul Wolfowitz used threats and vulgarities to pressure senior World Bank staff.
The advice that the African leaders received from their Chinese counterparts was sound, and much more practical than they typically get from the World Bank.
During the meeting, the Chinese leaders emphasized their readiness to support agricultural research as well. They described new high-yield rice varieties, which they are prepared to share with their African counterparts.
Whenever the Bank’s extreme free-market ideology failed, it has blamed the poor for corruption, mismanagement, or lack of initiative.
China’s rulers rarely wash their dirty linen in public.
Despite the government’s intermittent anti-corruption campaigns, progress has been slow.
Likewise, Hu Angang, an economics professor at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, has estimated that corruption in 1999-2001 alone caused economic losses worth RMB1,293 billion ($156 billion), or 13.2% of GDP.
With little recourse to legal means, an increasing number of frustrated victims of graft resort to extra-legal measures such as strikes, demonstrations, and sit-ins in order to gain media and public attention.
In fact, the US has played a key role in China’s rise.
The third phase began immediately after the 1969 Sino-Soviet military clashes, with the US actively seeking to exploit the rift in the Communist world by aligning China with its anti-Soviet strategy.
America depends on China’s trade surplus and savings to finance its outsize budget deficits, while China relies on its huge exports to the US to sustain its economic growth and finance its military modernization.
But now America has returned firmly to center stage.
His approach reflected a larger trend of rights-based resistance in China that began in that late 1990’s; Chen was part of a coterie of lawyers and activists, some well-known and many others not, who wanted to see the government behave according to its own rules.
Chen has paid a terrible price for living up to the ideals of the profession. At a time when the legal academy and the profession are under attack in the US, Chen’s case is a reminder of what strong lawyers and legal institutions provide to a society.
That would help to ensure that three decades of legal reform is more bone and sinew than running water.
Growth is still high, at about 10% per year, but has started to moderate.
The two 50-basis-point RRR increases just locked up the same amount of liquidity.
Furthermore, the PBC uses unconventional instruments from time to time, such as “credit ceilings” or “credit quotas” imposed on commercial banks.
Second, China’s central bank still controls interest rates by enforcing a roughly three-percentage-point spread between deposit rates and lending rates.
China’s New Currency Policy
China’s existing portfolio of some $3 trillion worth of dollar bonds and other foreign securities exposes it to two distinct risks: inflation in the United States and Europe, and a rapid devaluation of the dollar relative to the euro and other currencies.
A barrel of oil might still cost $90, but a 10% increase in the renminbi-dollar exchange rate reduces the renminbi price by 10%.
The three-percentage-point difference implies that the “real” inflation-adjusted renminbi-dollar exchange rate rose 9% over the past year (i.e., 6% nominal appreciation plus the 3% inflation difference.)
China’s New Economic Model
At every level, there is a consciousness of environmental limits and the realization that the resource-intensive consumption patterns now accepted in the United States would be a disaster for China – and for the world.
But this is a peculiar arrangement: a relatively poor country is helping to finance America’s War on Iraq, as well as a massive tax cut for the richest people in the world’s richest country, while huge needs at home imply ample room for expansion of both consumption and investment.
Western technological innovation has focused too little on reducing the adverse environmental impact of growth, and too much on saving labor – something that China has in abundance.
We should all hope that China’s new economic model succeeds.
But China’s soaring growth, seen in contrast with stagnation in Latin America’s economies, has awakened governments and businessmen across the region.
In the 10 years between 1993 and 2003, China’s and Hong Kong’s exports to Mexico rose from 1.12% of total Mexican imports to 5.8%.
Mexico’s so-called “Silicon Valley South” companies in Guadalajara have, by their own estimates, already lost more than $500 million worth of projects and approximately 20,000 jobs to Asia, especially to China, and this trend will continue in the short term.
Over the same period, China’s foreign-exchange reserves swelled by $128 billion, to $3.4 trillion – the largest quarterly increase since 2011 and equal to the total rise in 2012.
The current round of monetary easing underway in many advanced countries, together with strong expectations of renminbi appreciation, are also fueling currency speculation, placing further upward pressure on the exchange rate.
In March and April, cross-border renminbi trade settlement increased by ¥412.8 billion, up 57.6% year on year.
One can only hope that these measures will be sufficient to bring China’s export data gradually back to reality.
● a reversal of the country’s now rising income inequality; lowering the very high savings level relative to investment and thus reducing the current-account surplus;
For example, China’s labor-intensive export sectors are losing their competitive edge.
Urbanization will accelerate with supporting public-sector investment.
The government continues to own more than 50% of remaining state-owned enterprises, but does not need or use the income.
But it must also assume greater responsibility for global imbalances, economic and financial stability, and governance, as well as represent the interests of less powerful developing countries.
This pillar relies heavily on planning, large-scale fixed investment, and administrative controls, and its quality, scale, and relative efficiency were strategic to Chinese competitiveness and productivity.
What makes the Chinese economy more difficult to read is the increasingly complex interaction of all four of its production system’s components, with each other and the rest of the world.
First, the production chain must shift from export dependence toward domestic consumption.
BEIJING – The release by WikiLeaks of American diplomatic cables written between 2004 and 2010 contains considerable material on China’s policy toward North Korea.
But these interests are hard to quantify.
Although China claims that it “normalized relations” with North Korea in 2009, its policies and attitudes toward the North remain mired in a morbid comradeship.
Whenever a crisis erupts, China becomes agitated. But, instead of seeking a new path, it re-traces its old steps.
China’s Perfect Storm
The Chinese ship containing arms for the reviled Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe is finally headed home after protests and global condemnation prevented it from delivering its cargo.
Western critics of China have every right to protest any aspect of Chinese behavior, and vice versa.
The sudden downfall of Bo Xilai – and the call from Yunnan Province for the removal of the two Politburo members closest to him – is just one example of the no-holds-barred infighting now taking place in Zhongnanhai, the closed leadership compound in Beijing.
The Soviet Union imploded because the party was the state, and vice versa.
The PLA’s growing political clout has been manifest in the sharpening power struggle within the Party. In recent weeks, an unusual number of senior military officers have published articles in official newspapers calling for Party discipline and unity, and alluding to the military’s role in containing the infighting.
But on June 8, unnamed officials asked the doctors' son to collect some personal effects for his parents, including dentures, and deliver them to the authorities.
His exposé of the SARS epidemic cover-up forced China's government to confront the disease more openly and aggressively, averting a public health catastrophe.
Before giving his name, address, and phone number, he said, "Of course, I have considered the consequences that I might encounter after writing this letter.
Dr. Jiang Yanyong may become a millionaire, wear any clothes he likes, redecorate his living room, even buy a car, but he cannot inform the public about an epidemic or write government officials an honest letter of admonition.
For the last two decades, Chinese leaders have been diligently trying to build a new edifice in order to gain some of that missing respect.
As most of the world knows, America’s quest to maintain its claim to the title of “greatness,” has, of late, also been elusive.
The Invisible-Border War
For India, Daulat Beg Oldie is an important outpost near the entrance to the Karakoram Pass and the Siachen Glacier region. So, was China’s incursion into Indian territory an error by a local PLA commander?
Was the Chinese incursion intended to serve as a sort of diplomatic accelerator?
That lack of spillover will reflect the recovery’s focus on expansion of domestic demand.
But the more significant strategy is to alter government policies in ways that will lead to higher spending by Chinese consumers, and that raise the level of those government outlays, like health care, which directly benefit Chinese households.
The public pension system is unreliable, there is little health insurance available to pay for the high cost of Western-style care, parents must pay tuition for their children’s schooling, there is little credit available for purchases of consumer durable, and buying an apartment requires a large down-payment.
Some factors specific to China make this outcome more likely, but success is by no means certain.
But simply constraining new credit supply and allowing bad loans to default can itself provoke crisis and recession.
The Chinese working-age population is now slowly shrinking.
Second, China’s central government has low debt – only 22% of GDP at the end of 2013 – and thus significant fiscal firepower.
In an economy with inherited debts equal to 250% of GDP, simply tightening credit supply and imposing market discipline could be a recipe for disaster.
While much of the rest of the developing world, following the Washington Consensus, has been directed at a quixotic quest for higher GDP, China has once again made clear that it seeks sustainable and more equitable increases in real living standards.
China’s role in the world and the world’s economy has changed, and the plan reflects this, too.
Within a month of the adoption of the plan, new environmental taxes on cars, gasoline, and wood products were imposed: China was using market based mechanisms to address its and the world’s environmental problems.
Most people outside China do not fully appreciate the extent to which its leaders, by contrast, have engaged in extensive deliberations and broad consultations (even with foreigners) as they strive to solve the enormous problems they face.
Even when China’s voice could be decisive in resolving crises or preventing bloodshed, instead of acting, its diplomats repeat the old platitudes about non-interference.
When it is harnessed to promote growth and human rights, interference should be appreciated, regardless of the regime that is doing it.
Should its parochial interests give way to more cosmopolitan responsibilities? How it answers this question will largely determine how the world views it for decades to come.
According to an analysis used by some American economists and politicians, the low rate of currency appreciation, combined with Chinese export growth of 31% in 2010 over 2009, should have increased China’s trade surplus by a wide margin.
Simply put, if a country can improve its domestic balance, it will become more balanced externally, regardless of how little the exchange rate changes.
That will have a very significant effect in terms of reducing the current-account surplus, which reflects net national savings.
The US current-account deficit has been narrowing in recent quarters, thanks to export growth.
China's current leadership, one year after coming to power, has criticized "the single-minded pursuit of GDP growth" over the past decade and unveiled a new approach to modernization characterized as "balanced, human-centered, and environmentally friendly."
Most worrying is the ever-growing tax burden placed on the rural population.
So today's China is a much less equitable society than India.
China's government must acknowledge that deep income inequality and rural poverty is no longer exclusively an economic problem, but threatens social peace and political stability.
As a result of the slave-labor brick plants, as well as reports of an eight-year-old child worker being buried alive and migrant workers killed, Hongdong’s name has become infamous.
There are such dark spots everywhere in the country.
Seven years ago, a lawmaker from Hunan province went to Shanxi province to rescue slave workers from brick plants.
It seems today that in China the daily work of government is to keep people from protecting themselves and their families in an attempt to gloss over the crimes of a “harmonious society.”
Stability was on everyone’s mind at the annual China Development Forum (CDF) held March 17-20 in Beijing.
At the same time, there was considerable concern about the recent resurgence of state-owned enterprises, which has tilted the distribution of national income from labor to capital – a major impediment to China’s pro-consumption rebalancing.
Orchestrated by Chongqing Mayor Huang Qifan, the principal architect of the spectacular Pudong development project in Shanghai, the goal is to transform the Liangjiang area of Chongqing into China’s first inland urban development zone.
In short, the Four Uns have now become three.
Is China’s political environment loosening up, or is the government cracking down? It’s hard to tell.
Hu’s tightening of controls over political discourse and the media intensified with the publication in September 2004 of a list of “Top Fifty Public Intellectuals” in Southern Weekly.
Those who dare to protest, such as Beijing University journalism professor Jiao Guobiao, are silenced.
Asia’s Dammed Water Hegemon
Most of the new dams are planned for the biodiversity-rich southwest, where natural ecosystems and indigenous cultures are increasingly threatened.
This reversal is consistent with the pattern established elsewhere, including on the Yangtze: China temporarily suspends a controversial plan after major protests in order to buy time while public passions cool, before resurrecting the same plan.
China’s territorial claims on Russia are often noted in Chinese grade school geography textbooks, which include a number of Russian Far Eastern regions within China’s borders.
The geography of the exercises, and the offensive nature of the tasks undertaken, leaves little doubt that Russia was cast in the role of “potential adversary.”
No nation threatens China’s land borders.
Alienating the West is a foolish strategy when the greatest long term threat to Russia comes from the East.
China’s rulers see the Olympics as a stage for demonstrating to the world the exceptional vitality of the country they have built over the past three decades.
The 2,000-year-old city of Beijing should be transported into hyper-modernity, whereas his father’s 1936 Berlin design was, in his words, “simply megalomania.”
A gold medal signified the sporting abilities and dedication of individual athletes, not the supposed merits of the political system that produced them.
The Great Recession of 2008-2009 suggests that China can no longer afford to treat the Four Uns as theoretical conjecture.
The new Plan’s second pro-consumption initiative will seek to boost wages.
Specifically, that means social security, private pensions, and medical and unemployment insurance – plans that exist on paper but are woefully underfunded.
Today’s post-crisis world could hardly ask for more.
China’s government is divided on a number of matters, but there is a strong, sharp-edged consensus that social stability is at risk unless a robust stimulus package emerges to stave off further job loss.
And yet China’s reliance on economic policies that require the heavy hand of the state to achieve officially decreed targets had been fading.
Much of politics in China is local, but little of environmental protection is.
The main question is whether China can escape the pull of this old psychological syndrome – which kept it preoccupied throughout the twentieth century with debilitating sentiments of weakness, insecurity, and humiliation – and allow itself to be guided by a new outlook on the world, and even on old enemies.
First and foremost, aiding and inciting the expression of popular anger against Japan gives China’s Communist Party leaders a powerful and readily available vehicle for rallying domestic support, thereby legitimizing their own power.
Like recessive genes, they sometimes suddenly re-express themselves.
It has also driven up corporate savings, because firms’ earnings are growing faster than household income and (and, for that matter, faster than overall GDP).
They comprise, in roughly equal parts, the low-income workers who account for up to 65-70% of the total workforce.
During this long period, some get rich first, which means that others lag behind.
The social-security system is to be extended to cover all workers and farmers.
China the Responsible Stakeholder
Laying the foundations for increased trade among China, South Asia, and emerging Central Asia represents a better outlet for the Chinese construction sector than building more ghost towns at home.
Acknowledging this, the People’s Bank of China has negotiated currency swap lines with other central banks and has designated one of the country’s five large state-owned commercial banks as official clearing bank to settle transactions in renminbi in a variety of foreign financial centers.
But where its policies promise economic benefits for other countries, as in the case of infrastructure finance through the AIIB and the Silk Road initiative, they should be encouraged.
फिर भी PLA के विशेषज्ञ रेशम मार्ग पहल के "मोतियों की माला" से किसी संबंध को नकारने के लिए उत्सुकता दिखा रहे हैं। इसके बजाय, वे इसकी तुलना चीनी किन्नर एडमिरल झेंग हे के पंद्रहवीं-सदी के अभियानों से करते हैं जिसने अफ़्रीका को जाने वाले खजाने के जहाजों के बेड़े का नेतृत्व किया था। केंद्रीय सैन्य आयोग के सदस्य सुन सिजिंग के अनुसार, झेंग ने "एक इंच भूमि पर" अधिकार किए बिना या "समुद्री आधिपत्य" की इच्छा के बिना प्राचीन रेशम मार्ग का इस्तेमाल किया था (हालाँकि इतिहास साक्षी है कि उसने समुद्री चोक प्वाइंट नियंत्रित करने के लिए सैन्य बल का इस्तेमाल किया था - उदाहरण के लिए, स्थानीय शासकों की हत्या की थी)।
भारत निश्चित रूप से चीन के व्यवहार के प्रति आशंकित है। लेकिन चीन काफी सावधानी से चल रहा है ताकि यह अपने खौफ़नाक मंसूबों को प्रकट किए बिना, अपने लक्ष्य पर आगे बढ़ाना जारी रख सके। अमेरिकी शिक्षाविद जॉन गरवेर ने चीनी नीतिकथा का इस्तेमाल करके इस बात को बहुत अच्छे रूप में पेश किया है: "गुनगुने पानी के पात्र में मेंढक बेहद आरामदायक और सुरक्षित महसूस करता है। लेकिन पानी का तापमान धीरे-धीरे बढ़ने की ओर मेंढक का ध्यान तब तक नहीं जाता, जब तक वह आखिरकार मर कर पूरी तरह पक नहीं जाता है।"
Thanks to Chinese Admiral Zheng He, who steered his naval fleet across the Indian Ocean seven times in the early fifteenth century, the Chinese wok became the favorite cooking vessel of women in the southwestern Indian state of Kerala.
But he undoubtedly has a domestic motive as well, rooted in the growing prosperity gap between eastern and western China.
In fact, these fears have a strong historical basis.
Might China be on a similar – albeit less openly aggressive – path?
Selain itu, meskipun AIIB berkedudukan di Beijing, kementerian menyatakan bahwa penetapan kantor-kantor regional dan pihak manajemen senior akan dilakukan berdasarkan konsultasi dan perundingan lanjutan.
Prakarsa ini bertujuan mengembangkan kerjasama ekonomi dan integrasi di kawasan Asia Pasifik, khususnya dengan pembiayaan bagi infrastruktur seperti jalan raya, jalur kereta api, bandar udara, pelabuhan, dan pembangkit tenaga listrik.
Lebih lanjutnya, SRF dapat menjadi katalis bagi lembaga keuangan negara lainnya untuk berkontribusi pada ekuitas dan pembiayaan utang di beragam proyek. Dana SRF beserta investor publik dan swasta lainnya – akan membentuk investasi ekuitas bersama yang pertama bagi proyek ini.
China has been highly successful in its initial efforts to shift the industrial structure of its economy from manufacturing to services, which have long been viewed as the foundation of modern consumer societies.
With its prowess in central planning, China has always been adept at engineering shifts in its industrial structure – as the move toward services-led growth attests.
A proposed consolidation of rural and urban plans for pensions and critical health care is particularly important in this regard, as is the authorities’ commitment to allowing workers to transfer their hukou (residency permits) – and the associated social welfare benefits – wherever they move.
The focus on resolving China’s macroeconomic disconnect, reflected at the Fifth Plenum and a likely precursor of what to expect in the upcoming 13th Five-Year Plan, is thus very encouraging.
As commodity imports soared, the current-account surplus fell below 2% of GDP.
With hundreds of cities competing with one another through infrastructure development, “ghost towns" will proliferate.
Meanwhile, China's current-account surplus has again soared.
Demographic change – with the number of 15-to-30-year-olds, in particular, falling by 25% over the next decade – could also help.
Both countries recognize the implications of participating in an initiative that undermines the Asian Development Bank and even the World Bank, though South Korea has now announced its intention to join.
Indeed, their futures will be just as intertwined as their pasts were.
But deep historical resentments should not obscure the fact that South Korea is facing many of the same challenges as Japan.
But it can be effective only if they focus on the right issues – and that does not mean the AIIB.
The decision provided the most visible image yet of an emerging China-South Korea concert, one that China believes may prevent the region from sliding into cold war.
To be sure, South Korea and China remain deeply divided over their policies toward North Korea. Nonetheless, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, key to ensuring long-term regional stability, is in the interest of both countries – as well as Japan.
In late May, at the 14th Asian Security Summit, US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter called for a “shared regional architecture” that will enable all Asia-Pacific countries to rise peacefully. That is the right approach.
That, together with increased access to capital, will help to accelerate the development of the services sector, which is needed to create urban employment.
Meanwhile, many advanced economies have suffered considerably from their balance-sheet composition, with limited, poorly measured assets and outsize debt and non-debt liabilities.
This would augment savings options for an increasingly affluent population and strengthen support for long-term investment and development.
It can abandon the commanding heights model and develop its version of “state capitalism” to support the best of both worlds.
Whether the QE strain of market manipulation has accomplished its objective – to provide stimulus to crisis-torn, asset-dependent economies – is debatable: Current recoveries in the developed world, after all, have been unusually anemic.
The more proactive Chinese approach is the policy equivalent of attempting to catch a falling knife – arresting a market in free-fall.
The collapse of the equity bubble calls that effort into serious question.
In a globalized world where labor income is under constant pressure, the siren song of asset markets as a growth elixir is far too tempting for the body politic to resist.
Retail investors account for 85% of trades, in contrast to other major markets, where institutional investors – with their relative abundance of information – are the biggest traders.
The reason is that the Chinese stock market is not wholly liquid or globally integrated.
Moreover, returns on deposits are low (and had been negative), and the state-dominated financial system offers few diversified products.
The result, as we are now witnessing, is that a moderate sell-off can easily turn into a stampede.
But, unlike in other capitalist economies, money is not the only tool at the authorities’ disposal.
One-third of the people listed in the Hurun Report, the Shanghai-based monitor of China’s wealthiest people, are Party members.
What the CCP refuses to recognize is that corruption cannot be rooted out as long as the Party maintains its monopoly on political power; with no organized opposition or functioning civil-society institutions, officials will continue to use their positions of public authority as a vehicle to generate personal wealth.
Fortunately, there is little reason to believe such dire predictions, or that the market gyrations that have been driving recent headlines represent anything more than short-term volatility. After all, equity-price movements are a poor predictor of the real economy’s performance.
The rise and fall of the Chinese stock market should also be understood in the context of Chinese households’ limited options for storing savings.
China’s Live Stress Test
The Chinese displacement factor was the emergence of the country’s own Internet economy.
Financial crises have repeatedly been spawned by inadequately regulated financial innovation, with the combination of market greed and regulatory silos and blind spots enabling booms and busts.
At the end of 2013, when the Shanghai index was 2,116, the Chinese debt market amounted to 256% of GDP, and stock-market capitalization was 36% of GDP, implying an unsustainable crude leverage ratio of 7.2:1.
But, as the government determines how to offload its massive holdings of shares in an orderly manner, it must ensure that such efforts are funded by equity, not leverage, thereby enhancing market balance and resilience.
Sovereign wealth funds – the assets of which have swelled from just over $3 trillion in 2007 to more than $7 trillion today – also have a significant influence on global asset markets.
The OECD countries, despite being the source of modern history’s most devastating financial meltdown, have shown less appetite to advance sustainability as a design principle of their financial systems (the Bank of England’s ongoing prudential review of climate-related risks to the financial sector is a notable exception).
Green finance is at an early stage in China, just as it is in the rest of the world.
And the G-20 recently asked the Financial Stability Board to consider the risks that a possible “carbon bubble” – caused by markets’ overvaluation of fossil-fuel companies’ oil, coal, and gas reserves, owing to a failure to account for future limits on extraction and use – pose to the global financial system.
While there was no love lost between the United States and the Kuomintang leadership, the US gave Taiwan assurances of military protection, which deterred China from trying to unify the island with the mainland by force.
Before doing so, I made a point of telling the Chinese government what we were doing – opening a commercial regulator, not an embassy.
First, they are clearly worried that the Kuomintang, which lost last year’s local elections in a landslide, will lose the general election in January as well.
Taiwan’s system is democratic; China’s is not.
Excess capacity and falling growth are mutually reinforcing.
And that is not what has happened.
If excessively high real interest rates are undermining the domestic demand that China needs to reverse the economic slowdown, one naturally wonders why the government does not take steps to lower them.
But policymakers must recognize the damage being done by excessively high real interest rates.
Chinese leadership over the past decade and a half has been about fine-tuning and maintaining the momentum of Deng’s state-led development model, launched after the Tiananmen protests of 1989.
Similarly, though China remains fundamentally dissatisfied with its southern land borders and its sea borders to the east and southeast, its current leaders fear that isolation would result from an assertive and aggressive foreign policy.
Having grown up in a China that is now accepted as a legitimate great power, the new generation of leaders will be more impatient about China resuming its place as the paramount power in Asia.
The upcoming meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – two institutions dominated by the US and its Western allies – provide an ideal opportunity to change that.
The US seems to be stuck in the Bretton Woods system, the rules-based order – underpinned by the IMF and the World Bank, with the US dollar at its heart – that emerged after World War II.
But expanding the renminbi’s role in the international monetary system is just the first step toward institutionalizing a multipolar world order.
America will be in the spotlight once again.
Relative to GDP, the BOJ’s monetary-policy gambit could actually far outstrip the efforts of America’s Federal Reserve.
At home, that could mean adding workers, either by boosting female participation in the work force, which, at 63%, is among the lowest in the developed world, or relaxing immigration restrictions.
Likewise, Japan stands to benefit from its technological prowess in environmental remediation – an urgent priority for China in the years ahead.
There is one obvious and important caveat: Poor Sino-Japanese relations, owing to unresolved historical grievances, could prevent Japan from realizing the economic benefits implied by China’s economic rebalancing.
However tempting it may be to focus on such questions, they are the wrong way to think about the global economy.
On April 9, the US Treasury released the biannual report mandated by Congress to identify countries engaging in “currency manipulation.”
Such is the case with the stalled IMF quota reform, an issue where the rankings in fact are of some importance, but not in a zero-sum way.
If the Congress does not pass the IMF quota reform, the US can hardly blame the Chinese for undertaking initiatives such as the AIIB on their own.
Perhaps spurred by the recent appreciation of the dollar and the first signs that it is eroding net exports, congressional Democrats and Republicans are once again considering legislation to counter what they view as unfair currency undervaluation.
Capital inflows contributed to a large balance-of-payments surplus, and the authorities bought US dollars, thereby resisting upward pressure on the renminbi.
Congress may also want to target the eurozone in coming negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Another is an inappropriately low real (inflation-adjusted) foreign-exchange value.
The point is that bilateral trade balances have little meaning.
Just as the soft landing in early 2009 occurred in the aftermath of a horrific American-made crisis, this latest one followed the European sovereign-debt crisis.
China’s economy has certainly become more unstable, with major slowdowns in real GDP growth in 2009 and again in 2012.
Failure to act quickly on this program would leave China far too vulnerable to the inevitable next shock in a crisis-battered world.
Time is no longer on China’s side. It must act now.
Consider, first, domestic economic conditions, starting with the employment picture.
So if the Fed, for whatever reason, wanted to leave the interest rate unchanged, it needed an explanation that went beyond economic conditions in the United States.
As for the stock market – widely viewed as a kind of casino for a small fraction of Chinese households – only about 6% of China’s population own shares.
So the Fed is right to say that inflation is low because of the sharp drop in energy prices; but it need not worry about the effect of major trading partners’ lower currency values.
And to suggest that the United States Federal Reserve, or the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority, might have anything to learn from China’s financial authorities would have been thought absurd.
There is an ever-present risk that the property market might one day collapse, though banks would emerge in better shape than have banks in the US and the UK, because much speculative investment has been funded with cash, or with only modest leverage.
Until the recent near-implosion of Western capitalism, the North Atlantic authorities thought that the end of financial history had been reached.
We can now see the utility of a more flexible toolkit to respond to excessive credit expansion, or asset-price bubbles, where the manipulation of short-term interest rates can be a blunt instrument or, worse, a double-edged sword.
The elements of a broader consensus on the future role of financial regulation are in place, as long as Americans like Geithner can resist their constant desire to tell the rest of the world to do as they say, not as they do.
In the case of capital flows, this means retaining capital-account regulations as an essential tool of macroeconomic policy.
It is not just emerging markets that have had to pay heed to the dangers of rapid liberalization.
Indeed, China is perhaps the most successful example in history of gradual and pragmatic economic transformation.
China often does not even issue an official public notice of censorship; an “anonymous” phone call to a publisher, understood to be from an official agency, will suffice.
Far less surprising was the recent arrest of the well-known activist and human-rights advocate Guo Yushan, who has been involved with many so-called “sensitive” issues over the last decade.
President Xi Jinping’s unprecedented anti-corruption campaign was supposed to signify a shift toward a more transparent system, based on the rule of law.
Two factors appear to be the most important: China’s growth rate in the coming years, and whether its growth will be sufficient to maintain high levels of global demand for commodities. Even if it is, the impact is likely to be different for agricultural exporters (the members of Mercosur and some Central American countries) than for exporters of minerals and oil (Mexico and other South American countries).
China’s Political Interventions
Yet the Chinese government has remained committed to intervention, responding to the correction with heavy-handed, politically motivated measures, including the complete suspension of trade of many companies’ stocks.
Of course, the renminbi’s recent depreciation was much smaller than the de facto currency devaluations engineered by the United States and the United Kingdom after the financial crisis of 2008.
PRINCETON – The international system of economic governance is at a turning point.
But when US President Richard Nixon ended the dollar’s international convertibility to gold in 1971, much of the world moved to a floating exchange-rate system in which the value of any given currency can fluctuate wildly.
In short, the SDR is used less as a reserve asset than as the IMF’s own unit of account.
Furthermore, the renminbi now meets the requirement – which it did not in 2010, when China first tried to have its currency added to the SDR basket – of being “freely usable.”
The original SDR basket was too broad, just as the current version is too narrow.
The British businessman’s body was allegedly cremated before any autopsy was conducted.
The disgrace of Bo, Chongqing’s former Party leader, certainly falls into this category.
What was unusual about Bo was his open ambition.
It is possible that the murder accusations against Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, are part of such political theater.
Chen asked him to investigate abuses against him and his family.
Whether China intends to stay put by building permanent structures for its troops on the plateau’s icy heights, or plans to withdraw after having extracted humiliating military concessions from India, remains an open – and in some ways a moot – question.
A paralyzed and rudderless Indian government initially blacked out reporting on the incursion, lest it come under public pressure to mount a robust response.
To guard those projects, several thousand Chinese troops reportedly have been deployed in the rebellious, predominantly Shia region, which is closed to the outside world.
This means that, in political and economic terms, we are entering an East and Southeast Asian century.
Essentially, the concept has served to justify collectivist-authoritarian rule by aligning it with local tradition and culture, with autonomy defined in terms of otherness – that is, differentiation from the West and its values.
By contrast, the United States’ economic and political model, and that of the West, with its individual rights and open society, proved to be its sharpest weapon in the Cold War.
Right now, all eyes are on the undeclared frontrunners to become the first appointed president of the European Council.
World famous but controversial, Blair is capable of rallying public opinion and giving the European project the high profile that the EU craves.
The parliament is a further wild card in this wholly undemocratic and unpredictable process.
TOKYO – While the world focuses on the gathering of cardinals in Rome to choose a successor to Pope Benedict XVI, a similar conclave is underway in Tokyo to choose the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) next governor. And, as with the deliberations at the Vatican, politics, not doctrinal debate, is underpinning the decision-making process in Japan.
The growth strategy will include targeting industries like regenerative medicine, with greater spending, for example, on cell research conducted by Nobel laureate Shinya Yamanaka; it will also feature policies aimed at leveraging the power of women, who are underrepresented in the work force, particularly when compared to other modern economies.
This is the context in which the BOJ’s next “pope” is being selected. But, instead of a debate about monetary policy, the only question being asked is whether Shirakawa’s successor will come from the finance ministry, academia, or business.
The Europeans typically picked their nominee behind the scenes, as did the Americans, after only cursory consultation with developing countries.
In 1997, the mismanagement of the East Asia crisis by the IMF and the US Treasury transformed downturns into recessions, and recessions into depressions.
Where the IMF’s next managing director will come down on this issue – and on whether fiscal salvation is to be achieved through austerity, with costs borne by ordinary citizens, even as bankers get only a mild slap on the wrist – is critically important, but hard to predict.
What we are seeing now – open campaigning, as opposed to selection behind closed doors – seems to be a move in the right direction.
The people of Scotland voted by a comfortable margin of about 10% to remain part of the United Kingdom – not least because of the campaigning of three Labour politicians, Alastair Darling, Gordon Brown, and Jim Murphy.
Referendums are the favorite device of populists and would-be dictators.
In England, the electoral success of the UK Independence Party is one such example.
Conservatives held a majority of the seats in Scotland less than 60 years ago.
Let others, who oppose democracy in their own countries, take note.

I can recall countless instances of – how can I best put it? – Putin and his colleagues economizing with the truth on a spectacular scale.
Crimea was annexed on the spurious grounds that it had once been part of Russia – a justification that, if applied elsewhere, could underwrite the violent redrawing of boundaries in much of Europe.
If Farage had had some first-hand experience dealing with Putin, he might have reached an accurate assessment much sooner.
“Oh Freedom!
For example, the United States’ own record, at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere, has undermined American politicians’ credibility on this subject.
But reliance on realpolitik as the guiding light of foreign policy has a pretty shabby track record.
But China’s rulers would take a giant step forward by recognizing that such aspirations are not a threat to the country’s wellbeing.
Worldwide, an estimated 5.7 million people were employed directly or indirectly in the global renewable-energy industry in 2012 – a figure that could triple by 2030.
Colombia and Mexico have introduced similar initiatives.
Job growth in the low-carbon economy can easily compensate for these losses.
इसी दौरान उदयीमान अर्थव्यवस्थाओं – खासकर ब्रिक्स (ब्राजील, रूस, भारत, चीन और दक्षिण अफ्रीका) कहे जाने वाले देशों में तेजी से बढ़ती मध्यम वर्गीय आबादी अपनी खान-पान की आदतों में बदलाव ला रही है और इस मामले में अमीर देशों के लोगों के साथ होड़ कर रही है. आने वाले दशकों में, जैसे-जैसे आमदनी बढ़ रही है वैसे-वैसे मांस व डेरी उत्पादों की मांग भी बढ़ेगी.
स्वयं पशुओं को भी भयानक परिस्थितियों का सामना करना पड़ता है. इसके लिए उद्योग द्वारा उचित पशु-कल्याण मानक अपनाने का विरोध करना ही जिम्मेदार है. आश्चर्य की बात है कि किस प्रकार इस उद्योग को इतने बड़े आकार में बढ़ने दिया गया. इसका उत्तर सामाजिक-राजनीतिक शक्ति में छिपा है जिससे औद्योगिक पशु-पालकों व उत्पादकों को अपनी सही सामाजिक व पर्यावरणीय लागतें दूसरों के मत्थे मढ़ने की छूट मिल गई. फिर ये लागतें मजदूरों और करदाताओं से वसूली जाती हैं.
WASHINGTON, DC – As 2014 gets underway, signs of a fraying regulatory relationship between the European Union and the United States seem to be everywhere.
And, though EU agencies like the European Central Bank are assuming an increasing share of regulatory responsibility, divergences in decision-making procedures continue to affect the rate and nature of transatlantic coordination.
Whether implemented as part of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership talks or on an informal basis, mutual-recognition and substituted-compliance programs should become more robust, and they should provide procedural mechanisms for coordinating rule-making and administrative processes in real time.
As state authority weakens, tribal and sectarian allegiances strengthen.
In the ensuing political vacuum, sectarianism was the only viable alternative principle of organization.
Thus, for all of the initial promise of the political transition in Egypt that followed the demise of Hosni Mubarak’s military-backed regime, the result was the creation of a Muslim Brotherhood government whose exclusionary ideology made it an unlikely candidate for long-term success.
The US, in particular, should examine how it has handled the breakdown of Syria and Iraq, and stop treating each case as if there were no connection between them.
The traditional dove-versus-hawk debate is now crosshatched by an isolationism-versus-engagement cleavage, all of which is overlain with a deep mistrust of all government institutions.
In their view, any concession in the course of a negotiation is weakness.
Suspicions that these sites could be involved in enrichment activities proved to be well founded.
There was nothing opaque, however, in the sudden purge and swift execution earlier this month of Jang Song-thaek – or Uncle Jang as the media have taken to calling Kim’s not-so-avuncular one-time regent.
Indeed, the sin of insufficient loyalty – Jang was noticeably absent during the spring, when Kim threatened war against his neighbors and the United States – seemed to loom large.
Indeed, as China begins to address its own transparency problems, it might want to examine some of the dubious deals made with Jang and his cabal.
Moreover, China is gradually coming to the view that its coziness with and excuse-making for North Korea, more than its endless maritime disputes with everyone else in the region, is emerging as the major factor in how the world regards its rise.
For Russia, Asian countries – and especially China – seem to bring a barebones practicality to the relationship.
Yet the landscape – and seascape of East Asia – is vast and fast-shifting.
Putin may be content with his role in the Ukraine crisis, because all signs suggest that he believes he is righting a historical wrong.
DENVER – Anyone who doubts that the wars in Iraq and Syria are closely connected need look no further than the role of Al Qaeda’s Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, whose fighters have been pouring over the Syrian border into Iraq’s Anbar Province.
And while those internal checkpoints are being reinforced, the actual border with Sunni-dominated parts of Syria is becoming more porous by the day.
Syria’s bloody conflict is often described as an Iranian war, an effort to keep Syria’s Sunni majority in check and build power and prestige throughout the Levant.
The departure of the US military from Iraq, particularly those forces that helped to pacify Anbar against heavy odds, is permanent.
Iraq After Maliki
Iraq has been falling apart not just because of Maliki’s failure to reach out to the country’s 20% Sunni minority, but also because of the Sunnis’ failure to embrace a country whose majority political expression is Shia.
Rather than denounce the IS’s barbaric behavior, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the preeminent regional organization of Arab states, issued a series of tepid statements denying support for it in the wake of its entry into Iraq.&nbsp;The GCC countries mostly blamed Maliki for not doing more to address Sunni political frustration, as if that explained the IS’s campaign of mass murder.
A system based on cantons? Perhaps it should have a bicameral parliament with a communal-based upper house that could veto what a Sunni-majority lower house enacts.
Thus, the US has continued to do the wrong – or at best inadequate – thing: listening to and, worse, believing those who have been part of the problem.
In the Middle East, any effort to alter borders is likely to create many more problems than it resolves.
Obama has likened his Syria policy to the sustained operations against terrorist cells in the Horn of Africa.
This state of affairs argues for diplomacy at the international level to identify a workable plan for Syria’s future that reasonable people can support.
But, with the increasing organization of medicine around specific diseases, the term has come to refer to an open-ended set of conditions including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes, but not infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, or mental illness.
The most common response is disease-specific.
Acute episodes and expensive hospitalization can be avoided by providing expert team support for patient self-care.
It also meant that each country’s exchange rate could no longer respond to the cumulative effects of differences in productivity and global demand trends.
That helped Germany and France, but it also inflated real-estate bubbles in Spain and Ireland.
Japan, South Korea, and other major Asian trading countries have very flexible exchange rates.
The admonition rings in the ear of every slapdash undergraduate and corner-cutting postdoc.
And they enable the reader to track down previously unknown but potentially useful work.
The SCI gave rise to multiple citation-based measures, with two, in particular, warranting mention.
University presidents must work to boost their institutions’ citation records, even though they know that the validity and reliability of these data, and the rankings that they inform, are questionable.
Break Up Citigroup
Defenders of the megabanks – Citi, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley – dismiss Warren as an avatar of left-wing populism.
But both left and right agree on the fundamental asymmetry that the recent “Citigroup Amendment” implies: Bankers get rich whether they win or lose, because the US taxpayer foots the bill when their risky bets fail.
Wall Street for President?
On Dodd-Frank, Democrats – including Obama – are apparently of two minds on the extent to which they should stick up for their own reforms.
Warren’s message is simple: remove the implicit government subsidies that support the too-big-to-fail banks.
It is now obvious that this is not consistent with defending what remains of Dodd-Frank.
A few years later, the World Health Organization, and then other international agencies and donor countries, joined the cause, creating a coalition of official and private organizations that now support Rotary’s vision.
The key is to link a bold idea with a practical and powerful technology, and then to push the idea and technology forward through mass citizen action.
The solution is therefore not much more complicated than a polio vaccine.
The time has arrived for a massive effort by voluntary organizations to take up the MDG’s through private action.
They are most successful when people behave as part of civil society without necessarily being “civil-society” professionals.
And, of course, most of them are struggling to survive financially.
In the United States, people are already rating their own doctors at sites such as RateMDs.com and vitals.com; third-party doctor and hospital ratings are available at HealthGrades.com.
Imagine a program where pregnant women could sign up by cell phone for weekly reminders and updates, and to answer questions such as, “Is the baby kicking?”
So it is crucial that the unique challenges they present to civil liberties and privacy are quickly identified and addressed.
The price of drones is plummeting, too.
Instead, interested parties at all levels need to assess the potential impact on privacy, data protection, and ethics on a case-by-case basis.
Civilized Talk
The meaning of the words civilization and culture is very different when they are used in singular and plural forms. Cultures (plural) are the modes of living embraced by various human groups, and comprise all that their members have in common: language, religion, family structures, diet, dress, and so on.
But, while some cultures are proud of their plurality, others try to hide it.
The novelist André Schwarz-Bart used to tell this story: A chief rabbi was once asked why the stork, which is called Hassada (affectionate) in Hebrew because it loves its own kind, is classified among unclean animals.
This in turn threatens the functioning of the financial system and the effectiveness of the reform programs.
But if it all works, sharing risk now will not be expensive in the end.
And it is true that the benefits of deficit reduction, if achieved too fast, will be more than offset by the negative effect on growth.
But the confusion that has resulted is anything but harmless.
That is far from the truth.
Zimbabwe’s military and political elite has appropriated the diamond field’s immense wealth for itself, with no benefits for the millions of desperately poor Zimbabweans who need the kind of services that the country has the resources to provide.
It is therefore encouraging that concerns about Zimbabwean diamonds are being raised within the diamond trade itself.
A year ago, real rates were actually negative.
Observed real interest rates are measured by deducting expected inflation from these nominal rates.
The fact that financial booms and busts can occur amid relatively stable inflation does not help.
Low interest rates can sow the seeds of financial booms and busts.
Laying the foundations of a sustained recovery requires measures to strengthen public- and private-sector balance sheets, together with structural reforms aimed at raising productivity and improving growth potential.
Gates himself is the first to acknowledge that the public perception is far from accurate.
As with the information technology revolution, advances in clean energy will require the involvement of both the public and the private sector.
The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was a catalyst for the IT revolution.
Similarly, while charitable donations by billionaires certainly should be welcomed, companies should also be made to pay a reasonable amount of taxes.
Just eight years after Kennedy’s announcement, astronaut Neil Armstrong pressed his footprint into the lunar dust.
Indeed, the most frequently floated proposals leave much to be desired.
A Global Apollo Program would help the world reduce its CO2 emissions and cut its energy bills.
If countries sign up to the Global Apollo Program as part of the agreement in Paris, the meeting might just mark one giant leap for mankind in the fight against climate change.


यह सब मिलाकर उस उद्योग को बनाते हैं जिसमें ब्लूमबर्ग की गणना के अनुसार पिछले वर्ष तक निवेश $310 बिलियन तक पहुँच चुका था। यह कोई "अनूठा" क्षेत्र नहीं है, बल्कि परिसंपत्ति-प्रधान उद्योग है जिसका धीरे-धीरे वस्तुकरण हो रहा है।
Their rainforests are a vast storehouse of biodiversity, and forests are major carbon sinks, reducing the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Biodiversity and climatic stability are global public goods.
At the very least, markets like ETS should credit emissions reductions that result from limiting deforestation.
From a global point of view, the best use of these resources is to maintain the forests, which is even possible with managed cutting.
Para penasihat Presiden Johnson tidak begitu optimis.
Namun demikian, di balik meningkatnya kesepakatan ilmiah yang berusia 50 tahun, pemanasan bumi terus terjadi.

वर्ष 2012 के आकलनों से यह पता चलता है कि वायु-प्रदूषण से संबंधित कुल मौतों में से 88% मौतें निम्न से मध्य आय वाले देशों में होती हैं, जिनमें विश्व की 82% आबादी आती है। पश्चिमी प्रशांत और दक्षिण-पूर्व एशियाई क्षेत्रों में होनेवाली मौतों की संख्या क्रमशः 1.67 मिलियन और 9,36,000 है।
वायु प्रदूषण के कारण होने वाली समस्याओं के किसी भी समाधान के लिए न केवल नए आर्थिक मॉडलों की आवश्यकता होगी, अपितु स्थानीय, राष्ट्रीय, और अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सरकारों द्वारा संघटित उपाय करने की भी आवश्यकता होगी। उदाहरण के लिए शहरी यातायात से होनेवाले उत्सर्जनों में कमी करने हेतु सुसंबद्ध विकास को बढ़ावा देने के लिए नगर महापौरों, स्थानीय योजनाकारों, और राष्ट्रीय नीति-निर्माताओं को मिलकर काम करने की आवश्यकता होगी।
Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia will be the first to be exposed.
Most international waterways have such frameworks for dialogue, albeit at different stages of development and levels of achievement.
Rural hydraulic projects, which ensure access to water for these populations over large stretches of land, can prove to be efficient conflict prevention tools.
Responsible use will require adequate economic incentives.
Climate pledges will be made on the basis of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), or commitments to the reduction of emissions worldwide.
The revenue implications would be significant.
Ahead of the Paris summit, more than 160 countries submitted emissions mitigation pledges.
Perubahan Iklim dan Gereja Katolik
Barangkali yang menarik disini adalah 66% responden menyatakan akan “cenderung lebih mendukung” kandidat yang berpendapat bahwa perubahan iklim benar terjadi dan akan mendorong peralihan menuju energi terbarukan, sementara bagi 12% responden lainnya “sedikit kemungkinannya” bagi mereka mendukung kandidat seperti itu.
Namun kelompok ketiga lah yang sejauh ini paling berkuasa secara politik: kepentingan minyak dan batubara yang menyumbangkan ratusan juta dolar untuk kampanye 2014 lalu.
Setidaknya sejak diterbitkannya Summa Theologica (1265-74) oleh Thomas Aquina, hukum alam dan Aturan Emas dipandang sebagai pilar dasar ajaran Gereja.
The Adaptation Imperative
But it will be heaviest for developing countries, least-developed countries, and Small Island Developing States. Though international funding will be available, costs will fall largely to countries, with governments forced to divert scarce resources from development projects to adaptation initiatives.
For example, by planting scientifically engineered crops that grow faster, farmers can harvest them before, say, cyclone season, which will become increasingly violent as global temperatures rise. But there remain significant barriers to adoption – barriers that governments should dismantle through a combination of incentives, regulatory reform, and institutional upgrading.
Lately, however, the continent has reached an ideological impasse over how to address the problem, with environmental sustainability and growth often portrayed as being mutually exclusive.
To be sure, as with any innovation, there are questions about the technology's viability.
Europe cannot afford to lag behind.
But to achieve it, Europe must overcome the ideological stalemate that is paralyzing the environmental debate.
It, too, is essentially a balance-sheet problem, based on the stock of CO2 in the atmosphere
Given what we know now about the consequences of the high-carbon path for the natural environment and, in turn, health outcomes and quality of life, those costs could actually be negative.
This does not appear to be the case.
Akan tetapi terkadang kebenaran moral dan kepentingan ekonomi menyatu dan menciptakan peluang yang tidak boleh dilewatkan.
Sejumlah kemajuan penting sudah tercapai sejak konferensi Durban.
COPENHAGEN – One of the stranger spectacles of the climate change debate was the sight, earlier this month, of NASA climate scientist Jim Hansen marching hand-in-hand with Hollywood actress Darryl Hannah outside the Capitol Coal Power Plant in Washington, DC.
Coal accounts for almost half of the planet’s electricity supply, including half the power consumed in the United States.
Recently, former US Vice President Al Gore and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon claimed that, “in the US, there are now more jobs in the wind industry than in the entire coal industry.”
Every nation should ideally commit to spending 0.05% of GDP exploring non-carbon-emitting energy technologies.
This is especially true now, given that much of the developed world is in the midst of a painful recession.
Over time, a failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would lead to additional climate change, which in turn would increase the severity of poverty, the scale of internal displacement and migration, the scarcity of water, the prevalence of disease, and the number and intensity of storms.
Such an accord might well be desirable, but it is simply not an option for climate change any time soon.
But reaching an accord that sets binding ceilings for what each country will be allowed to emit is not an option in Copenhagen.
Efforts by Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean have set the groundwork for the world’s strongest bi-regional partnership on climate change.
This is in line with the EU’s long-term goal of reducing emissions by 80-95% (again, relative to the 1990 level) by 2050.
They are understandably reluctant to expend too much political capital by calling for a far-reaching deal.
Membangun Kepercayaan dalam Dana Iklim
Kenaikan suhu global dan iklim yang semakin tidak stabil akan mempengaruhi semua aspek pembangunan dan membahayakan investasi yang ada kecuali mitigasi dan adaptasi strategi yang memadai – juga penting bagi Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs) hasil rumusan PBB yang akan diadopsi akhir bulan ini – mampu ditetapkan.
Konferensi di Paris menawarkan kesempatan untuk membangun jalan yang jelas guna menghindari dampak yang paling berbahaya akibat perubahan iklim; para pemimpin dunia yang menghadiri pertemuan tersebut tidak boleh menyia-nyiakannya.
Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that the commitment will be honored.
Reaching that goal will require increased confidence in the policies and institutions of the countries in which the money is to be spent.
Some of the $100 billion will be channeled through the newly created Green Climate Fund; but the existing multilateral development banks should also play a central role, along with national aid agencies and departments.
At any given time, the global livestock population amounts to more than 150 billion, compared to just 7.2 billion humans – meaning that livestock have a larger direct ecological footprint than we do.
Already, the signs are worrying.
At the same time, governments and civil-society groups should promote healthier diets that rely more on plant-based proteins and calories.
Perhaps even in the depths of Mongolia, you would have heard the dire warnings emitted by journalists.
Estimates of temperature increases, heat waves, and cold waves are all nearly identical to those produced six years ago.
The IPCC report makes it clear that exaggerations of this magnitude have no basis in science – though clearly they frightened people and perhaps will win Gore an Academy Award.
Climate change is a real and serious problem.
With the world in a fury about cutting greenhouse gasses, it is easy to forget that there are other and better ways to do some good for the planet.
Indeed, recent surveys show that the public is growing steadily less trusting of the scientific consensus on global warming.
Nonetheless, he explained, “we thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact policy-makers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action.”
Elsewhere in the 2007 assessment, Working Group II claimed that “up to 40% of the Amazonian forests” were at imminent risk of being destroyed by global warming.
At the “Earth Summit” in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, 189 countries, including the United States, China, India, and all European countries signed on to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and agreed to stabilize greenhouse-gas emissions “at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”
Consider that even with a rise of only 0.8ºC so far, the planet has experienced record-high temperatures, more extreme weather events, and substantial melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which contains enough water to cause a seven-meter rise in sea levels. In Copenhagen, the pleas of representatives of small island states (some of which will cease to exist if sea levels continue to rise) for a target of 1.5ºC went unheeded, essentially because world leaders thought the measures required to meet such a target were politically unrealistic.
Another quick gain could come from encouraging people to eat more plant-based foods, perhaps by taxing meat and using the revenue to subsidize more sustainable alternatives. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the livestock industry is the second largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions, ahead of the entire transport sector.
The EAS, along with the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) ministerial meetings last July, made important contributions to improving the region’s security environment.
The aim must be to make the region more resilient to natural disasters as part of a broader framework for regional cooperation.
The Vienna Document, which is the key to understanding these OSCE efforts, obliges annual exchanges of information on existing military forces, the structure of armed forces, and major weapons and defense systems.
The gap between Europe’s security needs and its military capacities is widening, and most European leaders lack the will to do what is necessary to close it.
First and foremost, savings generated from restructuring must be reinvested in transforming military forces.
Nations that cannot afford to field expeditionary forces capable of performing the full spectrum of 21st-century missions should make greater use of specialization to enhance their contribution to Europe’s collective defense.
While NATO and the EU have improved their working relations, more steps need to be taken to eliminate mistrust, unhealthy competition, and information-sharing blockages.
Greater defense integration in Europe is not just an appealing or interesting idea; it is an imperative.
Moreover, in terms of economic participation and opportunity, women continue to lag behind men by a considerable 15-25% even in the most gender-equal societies.
WEF data suggest a strong correlation between a country’s progress in closing the gender gap – particularly in education and the labor force – and its economic competitiveness.
For example,&nbsp;research finds that women tend to be less confident and less likely to negotiate for pay raises and promotions than equally qualified men.
In the words of Klaus Schwab, the WEF’s founder, “Only those economies which have full access to all their talent will remain competitive and will prosper.
The coal industry seems determined to fight for profits at the expense of the global environment.
But China's capital is hardly unique in that respect.
That means cleaning up developed economies and working to prevent the massive expansion of industries that damage our collective health and future.
Last month, India’s Supreme Court found that all 218 coal-mining licenses allocated by the government in 1993-2009 had been granted in an “illegal and arbitrary” manner, with the committee responsible for the process lacking transparency and rife with corruption.
For starters, instead of conducting fair and transparent open-tender processes, governments often empower their ministers to decide which companies are allocated lucrative fossil-fuel exploration and extraction contracts, and conflicts of interest are not disclosed.
If foreign multinationals dominate extractive sectors and are allowed to repatriate their profits, instead of investing them locally, ordinary citizens receive virtually no benefit from what is often their country’s largest and most profitable economic sector.
Banks incurring balance-sheet damage will have to be recapitalized.
The question is what can be done about them.
“Sovereign cocos” have the advantage that their activation would not constitute a credit event triggering the credit-default swaps written on the bonds. The existence of large quantities of CDS, together with uncertainty about who has written them, has fed the reluctance to proceed with restructuring.
But not adding them is a recipe for more delay, more bailouts, and more chaos the next time the debts of a sovereign like Greece become unsustainable.
Governments in the region are pledging to cut emissions by as much as 25% by 2030, and to implement other measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change; overall, these efforts are expected to require at least $4 billion a year in investments.
Using the asset-backed security model, we recently joined with the UN’s Green Climate Fund and China to structure a $450 million “green bond” facility. This will allow pension funds and insurance companies to finance indirectly the necessary equipment upgrades in mom-and-pop stores and workshops from Tijuana to Tierra del Fuego.
Coca cultivation has been slashed by a quarter in the past five years, and seizures of cocaine have almost doubled.
First, drug users in Europe are switching to cocaine from heroin.
This raises a basic credibility issue: how can Europe urge Colombia and Peru to reduce supply when its own drug habit is driving cultivation?
The Andean region has less than 1% of the world’s land area, but more than 15% of its plant life.
Cold War Lessons for George W. Bush
Many of these scientists became leading proponents of human rights and liberalization inside the USSR.
But such scorn is misplaced, because popular entertainment often contains subtle images and messages about individualism, consumer choice, and other values that have important political effects.
Although the Soviet Union restricted and censored Western films, those that made it through had devastating political effects.
Lennon trumped Lenin.
For a start, Bush could learn to get out of the way and encourage more popular and grassroots contacts.
Many of these officials are former leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a militia that led an insurrection against Slobodan Milosevic’s Serbia.
It should also stand foursquare behind Prime Minister Hashim Thaci’s announced anti-corruption campaign, while monitoring it to ensure that it does not degrade into an effort to destroy his political opponents.
In May, Macedonian police shot and killed NLA members as they were trying to smuggling weapons across the border from Kosovo.
For a child born in the 1960’s, the diagnosis of the most common form of childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), meant almost certain death, with a survival rate of less than 10%.
The COG conducts research across the spectrum of cancers that afflict children, and has approximately 100 clinical trials underway around the world.
And yet, while this strategy has indeed resulted in better outcomes, the acute and long-term morbidity of therapy has been substantial.
The development of targeted new agents is likely to affect outcomes for other subtypes of childhood cancer, including anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and other types of leukemias.
Of course, a deteriorating economy is not exclusive to Colombia.
In addition, international financial markets perceive Colombia’s economy as being fundamentally sound.
But if the international crisis lasts longer than the first half of 2010, all bets are off, and Colombia will struggle to find its economic footing in a region devastated by generalized contraction.
But, in the Middle East and Central America, external actors – the United States and the Soviet Union – produced the change; in the case of the Colombian process, the change came from within.
In this case, returning land to dispossessed peasants and offering financial reparation to the victims and those who were displaced by the conflict became the way to peace.
West Africa, too, would be affected, having become in recent years the main transit point for South American drugs headed to Europe.
The good news is that the modern Colombia, the country of peace and progress, is winning.
But strong budget rules, similar to Chile’s, keep fiscal policy well anchored.
Firms learn to export new products by selling them in regional markets.
At a time of intensifying political conflict and painfully few success stories, Colombians are giving the world reason for hope.
With Uribe in charge, Colombia seemed to be on a roll.
Moreover, it might also lose Plan Colombia, the huge – and hugely controversial – American aid program that has funneled tens of billions of dollars into Colombia since the late 1990’s, ostensibly to fight the drug cartels, but also, in fact, to wage counter-insurgency.
Uribe may not deserve such a fate, but history works in strange ways.
Moreover, Colombia is no longer the world’s gold medalist in producing cocaine.
With a colossal and diverse geography of 1.2 million square kilometers, Colombia’s dramatically inadequate infrastructure is as much a handicap for economic development as poor security.
But the rule of law did eventually prevail.
His “Democratic Security” policy now seems to have definitively turned the tables in the country’s fight against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which have seen their leaders killed and their hostages freed.
Under the first scenario, Uribe faces the danger of being pushed into a “weak” or “unconditional” peace process.
If Uribe stands down, whoever succeeds him will probably maintain most of his policies and continue to work toward improving security in the country.
With Israel’s approval, The Carter Center has monitored all three Palestinian elections.
Hamas wishes now to consolidate its political gains, maintain domestic order and stability, and refrain from any contacts with Israel.
Recently, Israeli leaders have decided on unilateral actions without involving either the US or the Palestinians, with withdrawal from Gaza as the first step.
Casualties have increased during the past few years as the occupying forces imposed tighter controls.
Homosexual acts are crimes in Ghana - and across much of sub-Saharan Africa.
In Accra, a trendy street club named Strawberries is well known as a hangout for gays, and there are a few prominent, if still discreet, clubs where homosexual men and women gather.
Last year I worked in Ghana as country director of Journalists for Human Rights, a Canadian group that helps African journalists give voice to the voiceless in their society while raising awareness of human rights abuses.
While no one objected to the coverage by the Daily Graphic , no one denounced homosexuality either.
Yet the notion of "coming out" may not be a solution for every African homosexual.
Indeed, its malleability is the reason it has overcome periodic crises over the centuries and outlived critics from Karl Marx on.
The history of capitalism has been a process of learning and re-learning these lessons.&#160; Adam Smith’s idealized market society required little more than a “night-watchman state.”
This “mixed-economy” model was the crowning achievement of the twentieth century.
When Chinese-style capitalism met American-style capitalism, with few safety valves in place, it gave rise to an explosive mix.
Coming to Grips with History
In the Baltic Sea Region we have a particularly difficult history to deal with, if we look at the last 90 years.
But to the three Baltic countries the end of WWII led to half a century of occupation and lost opportunities.
The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard put his finger on one of the more fundamental problems: “Life must be lived forwards – but can only be understood backwards”.
Recent events have highlighted this problem – and Governor Zhou thus was right to call for a different system.
As a result, not even the euro has seriously challenged the dollar as the dominant reserve currency. Doing so would be even more difficult for the SDR.
The dollar being more liquid, its first-mover advantage proved impossible to surmount.
Transforming the SDR into a true international currency would require surmounting other obstacles.
Am I the only one who finds this logic a bit crooked?
Another big change has come from fast-growing emerging-market countries, many of which, facing a wall of money coming their way from slow-growth advanced countries (and mindful of the costs that large and volatile capital flows can bring), have chosen to apply capital controls.
This should not be surprising, since many factors besides international debt flows can cause domestic banks to throw caution to the wind and start lending recklessly.
These assets become “toxic” – not simply risky, but carrying a risk that cannot be quantified.
Indeed, its risk-free status was embedded in the European Union regulatory framework, which allows banks to hold large volumes of any eurozone country’s public debt without having to put aside any capital to cover potential losses.
The authorities acquired some of the “toxic” assets, which over time became easier to value, as a few years of data on mortgage delinquency rates allowed investors to find ways to measure the risk.
The European Council has solemnly declared that Greece’s de facto default (orchestrated through so-called “private-sector involvement”) remains an exceptional and unique case.
Doing so would lead them to recognize seven compelling reasons why a more collaborative approach to solving Egypt’s problems is in the country’s collective interest, as well as in their own individual interests.
Third, faced with chronic economic disorder and political instability, Egyptians increasingly lament the “hijacking” of the revolution, fueling mistrust of the country’s governing elites.
This could be addressed promptly; while eliminating inefficiencies and re-orienting institutions that were co-opted by the old system to serve the few rather than the many would increase potential output significantly.
While no single Egyptian leader can credibly convey Mandela’s message of “forgive but don’t forget,” together – working collaboratively and cooperatively – they can help to shift the country’s focus from the rear-view mirror to the road ahead.
The empowerment of ordinary Egyptians has fundamentally changed things.
Containing systemic risks, therefore, requires not just ensuring transparency and managing leverage in the system, but also recognizing that these risks vary along with asset values.  If institutions that were heavily exposed had understood this, they would have raised their capital buffers during the run-up in housing and equity prices in order to protect themselves against the inevitable reversals.
As a result, not only are countercyclical measures needed, but banks’ capital requirements should vary inversely with the boom-and-bust fluctuations in the asset markets to which they are heavily exposed.
Their aim is to discourage trading that pushes prices further away from the range and to encourage trading that helps to bring them back.
The first school of thought, broadly that of the United States’ Republican Party, was that financial regulation was bad because all regulation was bad.
More competition for investment-banking oligarchs from commercial bankers and insurance companies with deep pockets seemed likely to reduce the investment banking industry’s unconscionable profits.
And central banks’ failure to regard their primary job to be the stabilization of nominal income – their failure not only to be good Keynesians, but even good monetarists – raises the question of whether central banking itself needs drastic reform.

और फिर भी, उद्योग के कुछ प्रगतिशील अग्रणियों को छोड़कर, मात्र कुछ कंपनियों ने ही इस स्वैच्छिक मार्गदर्शन के लिए प्रतिक्रिया व्यक्त की है। 2013 में, डच शोधकर्ताओं ने यूरोपीय शेयर बाजारों में सूचीबद्ध उन 186 कंपनियों का सर्वेक्षण किया जो संघर्ष क्षेत्र वाले खनिजों का इस्तेमाल करती हैं। 80% से अधिक ने अपनी वेब साइटों पर इसका कोई जिक्र नहीं किया कि उन्होंने संघर्ष के लिए धन देने या मानवाधिकार के दुरुपयोगों से बचने के लिए क्या किया था।&nbsp; इसी प्रकार, व्यापार के लिए यूरोपीय आयोग के महानिदेशक ने यह पाया कि 153 यूरोपीय संघ कंपनियों में से केवल 7% कंपनियाँ ही अपनी वार्षिक रिपोर्टों में या अपनी वेब साइटों पर संघर्ष क्षेत्र के खनिज पदार्थों के बारे में उचित जाँच-पड़ताल करने की नीति का उल्लेख करती हैं।

Consumption is dropping, and companies are cutting investment.
Foreign investors are repatriating their funds on an unprecedented scale.
But, given the scale of capital flows, I am also urging the governments and central banks of the advanced countries to provide parallel financing to the IMF’s crisis-response programs.
Whatever the problems in the financial system, the massive improvements over the years in technology, productivity, and social progress – the real fundamentals – are a genuine testament to the power of globalization as a force for good.
These two countries are very dissimilar in many respects, but not in their carbon profiles: each accounts for between 22% and 24% of all human-generated greenhouse gases in the world.
Too much focus has been put on carbon cuts for nearly two decades, almost to the exclusion of other elements.
The international community must also focus on stemming man-made environmental change.
Confused by the Veil
If the First Lady wears a headscarf, maintained the secular-minded elite, the whole secular system could be undermined.
Many Turks who go to the US for the first time are puzzled, indeed, by its religiosity .
Why then can’t a similar sisterhood be achieved in the realm of politics?
If one makes no distinctions and disregards nuances one will end up believing that 60% Turkish women wear the veil.
Congo’s Infinite War
Today, a quarter of a million people are on the run, almost half of them on territory under rebel control and with almost no access to aid.
Together with other aid agencies, IRC staff formed a convoy and MONUC offered armed vehicles to protect it. But when armed men stopped the convoy on the road, the Uruguayan peacekeepers from MONUC simply turned around and vanished, leaving the aid workers to their fate.


सरकारों, बीमा कंपनियों, चिकित्सा पेशेवरों, रोगियों, और देखभालकर्ताओं को मिलकर काम करने की जरूरत है ताकि यह सुनिश्चित हो सके कि स्वास्थ्य निरंतरता में इस बदलाव को अच्छी तरह से प्रबंधित किया जाता है, ताकि पहुँच का विस्तार किया जा सके, परिणामों में सुधार किया जा सके, और उत्पादकता को बढ़ाया जा सके। साथ में मिलकर, हमारे पास अरबों लोगों के जीवन में सुधार लाने, अधिक स्वस्थ समाज तैयार करने, लागतों में बचत करने, और आर्थिक विकास को बढ़ावा देने के लिए अवसर है।
My greatest concern is that today’s financial crisis evolves into tomorrow’s human crisis.
First, we need a global stimulus package to turn this crisis around.
While the G-20 nations whose leaders met in Washington account for nearly 80% of world production, trade and investment, more than 170 other countries, representing one-third of the world’s people, were not there.
The great challenges before us are interrelated: the global economy, climate change, and development.
I spent my high school years in Calcutta, and I remember that if you picked up your phone, there was no guarantee that you would get a dial tone; if you got a dial tone and dialed a number, there was no guarantee that you would reach the number you sought, and you heard an exasperated “wrong number!” more often than a friendly “hello.”
I am not merely celebrating a triumph for India’s capitalists.
Farmers used to have to send an able-bodied relative – perhaps a ten year-old boy – on a grueling walk to town in the hot sun to find out whether the market was open, whether their harvest could be sold, and, if so, at what price.
It is not just in New York, Shanghai, or Paris that one finds a mobile telephone in the hands of each passerby. These days, one finds mobile phones in Nairobi taxis and among camel-herders in Northern Kenya.
In a Millennium Village in Ethiopia that I recently visited with the country’s health minister, a local father explained to me how he had decided to keep his daughter in school rather than marrying her at age 12 to a neighbor’s son. “I asked my daughter what she wanted to do,” the father explained, “and she told me that she wants to stay in school, so she is continuing in school.”
When poor families have fewer children, they can afford to invest more per child in health, nutrition, and schooling. Mothers can spend more time in the job market, breaking long-standing barriers of gender inequality.
Conquering Europe’s Debt Mountain
Perhaps worse, some also spent more than they could easily repay, given their economies’ declining long-term growth potential because of the aging of their populations.
Similarly, civil servants must forego promised pay increases, and the government is looking for annual savings in the federal armed forces of up to €3 billion through structural reforms.
Germany and France have proposed stricter rules on borrowing and spending, backed by tough, semi-automatic sanctions for governments that do not comply.
It can be done: Germany is reducing its debt burden to sustainable levels while strengthening its long-term growth prospects.
The World Bank estimates that natural capital constitutes a quarter of total wealth in low-income countries, compared to 3% in the highly developed economies.
The Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF), an international initiative launched eight years ago, is based on the principle that local communities themselves are the best trustees of the environment that surrounds them, and that their economic growth will advance their capacity to care for nature.
The place to start is 1825, when panicked investors wanted their money invested in safe cash rather than risky enterprises.
To do so would be a truly radical step indeed.
So I wonder: why didn’t the US Congress follow the RFC/RTC model when authorizing George W. Bush’s and Barack Obama’s industrial and financial policies? Why haven’t the technocratic institutions that we do have, like the IMF, been given a broader role in this crisis?
After this performance, why give the Republicans another turn at the helm?
It’s a great line and it applies.
The young may be taking the lead – what Obama calls “a revolution from the bottom up” – but there is little opposition from today’s parents.
That’s a lot better than what we have today.
This question is not trivial, because the fiscal hair shirt has become the favored article of policy clothing among those who now dictate economic affairs.
Keynes pointed out the fallacy here: while the income derived from production is, by definition, equal to the value of production, it does not follow that all this income will be spent.
Keynes denied that real wages are set in the labor market.
For Keynes, this is untenable: “Actually…we have as a rule only the vaguest idea of any but the most direct consequences of our acts.”
If we don’t, the next one will come sooner than we think.
By 2004, the constitutional review process had broken down, owing to major disagreements between Kibaki’s camp in the coalition government, and the rest of the country.
Fortunately, that violence seems to be behind us.
During rush hour in Nairobi, it is nearly impossible for disabled people to get to the city center to work in their tiny businesses, which normally involve selling sweets and polishing shoes near the sidewalks, by public transportation.
Corruption flourishes only because most Kenyans give rather than take bribes.
I recently debated this point with Krugman at a New York Review of Books event.
Once winded political elites had recovered their breath, they began telling a story designed to preclude any further fiscal stimulus.
The bleeding school produced some flaky evidence to show that this had happened in a few instances.
Although Krugman invented his discourse for an American readership, it perfectly fits the British case as well.
These changes happened recently – and fast. How did they occur?
Otherwise, they could face a fate similar to Nokia, which was disintermediated by one tech company (Apple) and acquired by another (Microsoft).
But, while some well-established companies in traditional industries are already looking for ways to adapt, others still need to do a lot more.
But four general guidelines can help managers effectively adapt their mindsets and business models to facilitate orderly and constructive self-disruption.
Households consume one third of the final energy used in the European Union and produce around two-thirds of municipal waste.
In times of crisis, consumers are likely to prioritize high-quality products that will last a long time and won’t go out of style.
This is all the more true for educating consumers about energy-efficient behavior and its implications for their own economic welfare.
We are also working closely with the Confederation of Food and Drinks Industries in Europe on its European Food Sustainable Production and Consumption Round Table.
Containing Financial Turmoil
Even many of the poorest countries seemed, at long last, to be joining in, posting strong growth on the back of rising energy and raw material prices, renewed mining investments from abroad, and increasing fiscal revenues.
While there has been some progress on harmonizing standards and extending surveillance, there has been far too much emphasis on strengthening governance in developing countries and not enough on systemic problems linked to unregulated private capital flows.
Containment, not Appeasement
This was not the first time that containment – a strategy devised by George Kennan, the director of the US State Department’s Policy Planning Staff under President Harry Truman, in response to the Soviet threat after World War II – has been rejected as appeasement.
The hugely unpopular Shah they installed was swept away in the Islamic revolution in 1979.
It should have been the model in Iraq, as it now should be the model in Iran.
Terrorist groups can be minimized if their enabling states are contained.
NEW YORK – Earlier this month, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a 24-year-old US citizen of Middle Eastern descent, opened fire at two military sites in Chattanooga, Tennessee, killing five.
But there is plenty of precedent for an alienated and disenchanted young man, brought up in the West (Abdulazeez attended high school and college in Chattanooga), to seek a cause worth fighting for – and to find it in the perceived humiliation of Islam by America and the West.
Kennan recognized this tendency decades ago, when he warned that shortsighted policies at home and abroad had already put America in a vulnerable position.
Russia, under Yeltsin’s successor, Vladimir Putin, defeated the separatists again, restoring federal control over the territory.
In this respect, however, Obama is hardly unique.
Moreover, much depends on external conditions.
Among the soft-power skills are emotional intelligence (self-control and the ability to use emotional cues to attract others); vision (an attractive portrait of the future that balances ideals, objectives, and capabilities); and communication (the ability to use words and symbols to persuade both an inner circle and a broader audience).
This skill is crucial in unstructured situations, when it is often more difficult to ask the right questions than it is to get the right answers.
But Chinese television fare, at least, no longer consists of the prudish melodramas and clumsy indoctrination programs of the Maoist past.
Given the staggering amount of programming needed to fill the time slots, content monitoring must be implemented with maximum efficiency.
Top-down directives and outright censorship are rare.
In effect, the system has become largely self-regulating.
Many TV producers have internalized these controls so well that they are an unconscious fact of life, and audiences now entertained by endless costume dramas and soap operas are not clamoring for freer political content.
Their failure would have dire consequences for the entire region.
The question remains whether Bashar understands that peace is not only about regaining the Golan, but also about normalization of relations with Israel, which his father was reluctant to allow.
Neither the Palestinians nor the Syrians will acquiesce to their exclusion.
The 2009 “World Prison Population List” compiled by the International Center for Prison Studies at King’s College, London, put the total number of inmates in Chinese jails at 1.57 million – larger than the population of Estonia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius, Swaziland, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Fiji, or Qatar.
In theory, such practices run counter to regulations promulgated by the Chinese commerce ministry in August 2006, in response to a backlash against Chinese businesses in Zambia following the death of 51 Zambian workers in an explosion at a Chinese-owned copper mine.
But even before convicts became part of China’s overseas development effort, some Chinese projects, especially dam-building schemes, were embroiled in disputes with local communities in Botswana, Burma, Pakistan, Ghana, and Sudan.
वास्तव में, यही कारण है कि इस उद्यम में रूस की केंद्रीयता इतनी अधिक पेचीदा है। यह देखते हुए कि रूस हाल के समय तक - उत्तरी गोलार्द्ध के सबसे महत्वपूर्ण आर्थिक समूहीकरण - जी-8 का सदस्य था, ऐसा लग सकता है कि इसकी BRICS के अन्य चार सदस्यों के साथ कम आत्मीयता है, जिसे वैश्विक फ़ोरमों में परंपरागत रूप से प्रमुख विकासशील-देश की आवाज़ के रूप में देखा जाता है। लेकिन, BRICS के विचार का लाभ उठाकर, पुतिन ने वैकल्पिक वैश्विक प्लेटफ़ॉर्म का निर्माण करने - और वैकल्पिक वैश्विक नज़रिये को आगे बढ़ाने - की अपनी इच्छा प्रकट की।
BRICS देशों में समान बात मौजूदा विश्व व्यवस्था में उन स्थानों से बहिष्करण है जिसके बारे में उनका मानना है कि वे ही वहाँ रहने के योग्य हैं। हो सकता है कि यह नई भरोसेमंद अंतर्राष्ट्रीय व्यवस्था के लिए पर्याप्त आधार न लगे। लेकिन यह देखते हए कि जब 2050 से पहले उनकी अर्थव्यवस्थाएँ जी-7 के देशों की अर्थव्यवस्थाओं को पार कर लेंगी, तो फिर जो दिखाई दे रहा है वह छलावा भी हो सकता है।
Moreover, international development players – including UN agencies, NGOs, corporate citizenship programs, and other charitable organizations – rarely coordinate their activities, even though their interventions are increasingly concentrated in densely populated cities.
In construction, for example, contractors are forming partnerships with labs to test materials that better reflect heat while absorbing energy to power cooling systems, and utility companies are leveraging new software tools to deploy smart meters in homes and offices.
Many cities worldwide are following its example, expanding their water catchment and treatment programs.
While some factory jobs can be outsourced or automated, robots cannot yet retrofit buildings, install solar PV cells on rooftops, or construct vertical farms.
As Martin Wolf has emphasized, the 2008-2009 financial crisis made voters understandably angry at “greedy plutocrats and their lackeys in politics and media.”
But what is true of financial markets need not be true of other markets.
It is great to be Keynesian – but during both halves of the cycle.
We did this in Chile during the copper price boom of 2006-2008, running budget surpluses of up to eight percentage points of GDP.
Canada has a single public payer but mostly private providers.
Political leadership – Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, is one example – is now required to push those ideas forward.
During the Cold War, social democracy was Western Europe’s egalitarian alternative to communism.
Blair vacationed with Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s plutocrat prime minister. Clinton used his presidential pardon to allow wealthy cronies to elude justice.
Compared to Corbyn, Sanders is a moderate.
It is unlikely, but possible, that a hardliner like Ted Cruz, or a rank amateur with deep religious convictions, such as the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, will capture the party.
And, as I have noted previously, people are not only paying greater attention; they also have more power than ever before to make their voices heard.
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted a rule at the beginning of August requiring public companies to disclose the pay gap between workers and CEOs.
As the full extent of the cover-up was revealed, foreign investors, like GIC Private Limited (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund), rebelled.
CalPERS (the California Public Employees’ Retirement System), a $300 billion pension fund, has published its corporate governance principles, which include boardroom diversity, fair labor practices, and environmental protection.
That public sentiment is affecting business worldwide.
Working closely with others who think differently can be scary and frustrating.
Research has shown that such teams outperform others, which means that this approach can lead to a tremendous competitive advantage.
As former Procter &amp; Gamble CEO and current US Secretary of Veterans Affairs Bob McDonald is fond of saying, leaders have a responsibility to make sure that their organization can “do well and do good.”
To understand why, it is important to focus on the individuals who make decisions for companies.
But, because publicly traded companies usually have a large amount of capital in place, lax rules would enable insiders to use this capital to their advantage.
Countries that are more developed, and have political systems that are more accountable to voters and less vulnerable to corporate lobbying, may lead to better corporate governance and investor protection rules.
Upon closer inspection, the supposed negative consequences of investor short-termism appear not to be happening at all.
But the problems associated with them – from price hikes of life-saving drugs to serious environmental damage – are not the result of managers’ excessive focus on short-term stock-market results.
True, buybacks can undermine a particular firm’s ability to invest in its own future, causing incumbent employees and managers to lose out.
Corporate Short-Termism in the Fiscal Cliff’s Shadow
But highlighting short-term trading in stock markets obscures other powerful sources of short-termism in corporate time horizons, such as uncertainty about long-term government fiscal policies on both sides of the Atlantic.
The declining average is partly due to a furiously trading fringe.
Companies on both sides of the Atlantic could be thrown off course by the US fiscal cliff and the EU sovereign-debt crisis.
Is corruption something that has always existed here but was somehow hidden until now? Are we learning of it because our prosecutor and police are bolder and better equipped nowadays?
True, corruption has also become more common in other countries in recent years, and many democracies are stained by links between politics and finance.
Injustice and exploitation are an everyday occurrence, justified by references to security or the ideology of Greater Israel.
In these conditions, a strong judicial system and police force do not always suffice to contain corruption.
The police, whose phone taps led to a wave of arrests, have filed charges alleging involvement by well-known organized crime figures. They have even linked a player for India’s national team to the fugitive Dawood Ibrahim, widely suspected of being the architect of the 1993 Bombay bombings, who has been hiding in Pakistan.
To keen observers, the IPL represented more than a sports league; it signaled nothing less than the emergence of a new India.
The character flaws laid bare in the IPL must be curbed if India is ever to fulfill its obvious promise and take its place at the front of the world stage in the twenty-first century.
Cory provided policy guidance as Commander-in-Chief, but trusted the Defense Department and Armed Forces to carry out their missions in the face of 9 coup attempts which were all frustrated.  These mutinies were all death-dealing situations that threatened national stability, and yet she never flinched. 
These are the internal wars every nation and society, no matter how big or small, must win.  Cory Aquino’s lifetime of service and sacrifice provided the tools and a model for how to win that seemingly eternal struggle.  To sustain such a treasured legacy and defend democracy wherever it is threatened is our collective responsibility.
During the last three decades, middle-income households in most developed countries enjoyed larger increases in disposable income than comparable US households.
Over the past several decades, as growth in disposable income slowed, middle- and lower-income households turned to debt to sustain consumption.
Looking to the future, growing income inequality and stagnant incomes for the majority of Americans mean weaker aggregate demand and slower growth.
Given the US Supreme Court’s evisceration of campaign-finance restrictions, it has become easier than ever for concentrated economic power to exercise concentrated political power.
It noted that “borrowers at risk of significant mortgage payment increases remained a small minority, concentrated mostly among higher-income households that were aware of the attendant risks,” and concluded that “indications are that credit and risk allocation mechanisms in the U.S. housing market have remained relatively efficient.”
The IMF has been criticized for burdening borrowers with unnecessary and sometimes perverse lending conditions, but its highly qualified staff has not been shy in blowing the whistle when it perceived domestic vulnerabilities in other countries.
Countdown to Withdrawal from Iraq
But it also reflects a growing belief that the war is failing.
Some, like John Murtha and Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, want a short timetable, while others, like Senator Joseph Biden, resists a firm timetable but predicts a withdrawal of 50,000 US troops in 2006, with many of the remaining 100,000 to follow in 2007. Those of us who believe that invading Iraq was a mistake, and that Bush is guilty of hubris in his failure to plan adequately for the aftermath, face a dilemma: if America withdraws too precipitously, it may compound these mistakes.
Similarly, if Bush sets a short timetable, he may encourage the insurgents to wait him out.
Instead, Bush should plan on a two-year window to give the Iraqi government as strong a chance as possible before the Americans leave, while emphasizing that Iraqis will thereafter be responsible for their own security and political salvation.

और फिर भी मौलिक और टिकाऊ समाधानों के लिए स्थानीय प्रतिभा महत्वपूर्ण होती है। दरअसल, अनुसंधान की समावेशी संस्कृति का विकास करने पर, स्थानीय नवाचार में ऐसे लाभ प्रदान करने की क्षमता होती है जो हल की जानेवाली विशिष्ट समस्या से कहीं अधिक होते हैं।
Indeed, it is a question that also speaks to the increasingly worrisome outlook for the global economy.
Indeed, until the recent renewed downturn in America and Europe, the emerging world’s major policy concern was too much growth, mounting inflationary pressure, and economic overheating.
Thus, they would minimize the deterioration in their trade surpluses, maintain competitive exchange rates, and safeguard their foreign reserves and net-creditor positions.
But such steps, while notable, would prove insufficient to counter fully the slowdown emanating from the West; and it certainly would not materially change the outlook for the United States and Europe.
Indeed, Richard Nixon’s journey to China in 1972 opened the door for China’s return to the international community.
When left to the market, many firms and individuals try to innovate, so the overall probability of success can increase dramatically.
But when a country’s growth rate continues to increase, its saving rate would increase faster than its investment rate, so it is more likely to run a current-account surplus.
While this model has, of course, helped the US to become the world’s leading economy, it has also delivered severe structural problems.
But, while large capital inflows reduce borrowing costs, they also tend to cause current-account deficits: lower costs of capital boost asset prices, with the wealth effect then prompting people to consume more than they earn.
But progress has mostly stalled.
But we can expect that the market for long-term GDP-linked bonds from countries like Argentina, where the future of the economy is uncertain, would be volatile, as investors adjust their expectations of future GDP growth up and down in response to new information.
To be sure, investors would have then lost on their bet on Argentina’s growth, but they would still have been protected against inflation, even if their bonds had not been denominated in dollars (because Argentina’s nominal GDP would have moved up with inflation).
The spread of inflation-indexed bonds serves as a historical precedent.

Will living standards rise worldwide, as today’s poor countries leapfrog technologies to catch up with richer countries? Or will prosperity slip through our fingers as greed and corruption lead us to deplete vital resources and degrade the natural environment on which human well-being depends?
Mobile phone coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has gone from nearly zero subscribers 20 years ago to around 700 million today.
Scientists have even given a name to our era, the Anthropocene, in which humanity (“anthropos” in Greek) is having a large-scale impact on the planet’s ecosystems.
So, what will it take to write the happy ending? First, we must recognize that we, as a global society, have a choice to make.
In the months and years ahead, these leaders will share their visions of a prosperous and sustainable global society.
For example, if the US hadn’t provided essentially unconditional support to Citigroup in 2008 (under President George W. Bush) and again in 2009 (under President Barack Obama), the resulting financial collapse would have deepened the global recession and worsened job losses around the world.
The problem is incentives – what bailouts imply for attitudes and behavior within the financial sector.
Unfortunately, this is simply not the case.
LAGUNA BEACH – One of the most difficult challenges facing Western governments today is to enable and channel the transformative – and, for individuals and companies, self-empowering – forces of technological innovation.
In this context, taking the steps needed to upgrade economic systems, including infrastructure in the US and the incomplete union in Europe, or to meet historical challenges like the refugee crisis, seems all but impossible.
Even when governments decide to implement policies that enable economic upgrading and adaptation, they cannot do so in isolation.
Otherwise, the transformative forces will leave them and their citizens behind.
We buy things that mean something more to us than what we use them for.
Europe gave the world Hippocrates, da Vinci, Voltaire, Beethoven, Florence Nightingale, Dostoyevski, Nobel, John Lennon, and many others who have shaped world culture.
This will require an explicit emphasis on ensuring the conditions that promote and sustain creativity, and the updated Lisbon Strategy that is to be launched in March should include a commitment that Europe will move in this direction.
In a word, no.
Unfortunately, sometimes prices fail to perform this signaling function properly, as the dot-com and housing bubbles in recent years showed.
In this respect, CDSs are unique.
Medical tests, too, often bring bad news, but abolishing medical testing does not solve problems, it only hides them, making them worse.
To do so would only sow the seeds of the next bubble.
There is only one problem: Chinese people do not seem to want to consume, at least according to commonly cited data.
People in their twenties could borrow money to buy a house, start a family, and go on holiday, paying the money back when they are in their fifties and would much rather stay at home and enjoy their grandchildren.
First, banks still have few reliable means of checking borrowers’ creditworthiness, including previous loans from other banks.
Finally, China needs a greater diversity of financial products.
Consider Strike Debt, an offshoot of the Occupy movement, which calls itself “a nationwide movement of debt resisters fighting for economic justice and democratic freedom.”
Rolling Jubilee bought it for $106,709.48, or about three cents on the dollar.
None of this is new.
Widespread social resistance to creditors’ claims on debtors’ property for non-payment has meant that “foreclosure” has rarely been carried to extremes.
Rather, we need to limit the supply of and demand for credit to what the economy is capable of producing.
Italians, after all, migrated not only from Italy’s south to its north, but also to other countries looking for a better life.
The Roma population, indeed, has 41% seasonal workers, 33.5 % lack any professional skills, 38.7 % are illiterate.
People who know the frightening neighborhood of Tor di Quinto, where Giovanna Reggiani was killed have harsh words to say about the neglect and indifference of Rome’s city government.
It will happen, I hope, also in other places and not only with Romanians but with all the people ready to face the provocations of our time.
And some women’s rights advocates have supported laws that criminalize transmitting HIV, arguing that these laws would punish men who concealed their HIV-positive status from their sexual partners, including their wives and girlfriends.
Laws criminalizing the transmission of HIV undermine public health because they deter people who are HIV-positive and those at risk of acquiring the virus from seeking testing, counseling, and treatment.
The Disintegration of Europe
The eurozone and refugee crises have common features that make them tricky to resolve.
Restructuring Greek debt in 2010 would have implied a financial hit for French and German banks (and the governments that stood behind them), but a much smaller loss than that implied by the mushrooming costs of an enduring crisis. Likewise, whereas welcoming refugees requires an initial investment of public funds, it can pay dividends as soon as the newcomers start working.
Merkel has played a much more positive role in the refugee crisis.
Countries joined; none left.
The vast majority of those who have fled the carnage in Syria live in camps in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. Indeed, at least ten Turkish cities are now home to more refugees than original inhabitants, and more Syrian refugees are living in Istanbul than in all the EU countries combined.
In today’s disagreements lie the roots of a stronger union.
Not surprisingly, Hong Kong’s oligopoly of property tycoons opposed changing the peg despite the currency’s gross overvalue at the time.
When, during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, global investment professionals turned their attention from Thailand and Korea to Hong Kong, they quickly spotted structural weaknesses in the way the currency was managed.
He claims that he should be rewarded as a fund manager supervising a multibillion-dollar fund in the private sector.
There is much speculation that Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang is about to appoint a generalist civil servant better known for his personal loyalty than for his financial expertise.
(The formal program was mostly publicly traded companies talking about their earnings outlooks, with one section reserved for privately held companies.)
In the end, SharePractice will adopt more or less the same revenue model as Epocrates: freemium/subscription, perhaps institutional sales, and lead generation.
The WiserTogether service uses a unique interface/data-presentation model to provide personal advice to consumers of medical services, though it will be sold primarily to institutions and doctors.
We aren’t invading their privacy, because no one cares who they are – only where they are and how fast they are going.
Ultimately, economic progress depends on creativity.
Phelps stresses that corporatist thinking has had a long and enduring history, going back to Saint Paul, the author of as many as 14 books of the New Testament.
For Le Bon, “An individual in a crowd” – not only angry mobs on the street, but also other psychologically interconnected groups of people – “is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand, which the wind stirs up at will.”
When the United States’ Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, which facilitated true crowd-funding of enterprises, was signed by President Barack Obama in 2012, it was an experiment, too.
YANGON – Religious orders of monks have been the face of Burma ever since Buddhism was introduced here more than 1,000 years ago.
As monks, we believe in alleviating suffering wherever we see it, as part of the vows we have taken.
We know that some people in the army and organizations close to the regime have been reluctant to use violence against the monks.
Brigadier General Kyaw Hsan, a representative of the military, recently told UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari that the marchers in the streets were “bogus monks.”
The military government will do anything to remain in power, and their violent acts must be exposed to the world.
This represents a tragedy that is as avoidable as it is immense.
Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Peru, and Botswana all halved neonatal mortality during the 1990s.
But the world needs to act now to generate the political will and financial resources needed to save the lives of up to three million babies who die each year simply because they are born without the basic care that is their right.
Shareholder value was dismissed as a fad and a fraud.
The scandal looked like an obvious weapon to be used in the war of rival models of business organization: critics portrayed Parmalat as the latest manifestation of a crisis of European-style family capitalism.
The two styles of capitalism can be contrasted as the family firm versus the post-modern firm.
In the past, the concern with long corporate life was criticized for restricting growth.
Membership in the IMF is a precondition for joining the World Bank, and the advantages that Cuba could gain from membership in the latter are easy to see.
Moreover, none of these other potential sources of financing would match the World Bank’s technical support.
It takes more time to build up skills and open trade opportunities than it does to lay off workers and shut down inefficient firms.
As soon as Cuba files an application, the IMF will send a technical mission to gather the necessary data and prepare a paper describing the economy and recommending a quota of voting rights and contributions.
Arrangements would then be made to sign the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
After Cuba joined the IMF (and the World Bank) in 1946, it played a positive role in the Fund for the next 12 years.
After the US trade embargo was imposed in 1960, Cuba became heavily dependent on the Soviet Union for economic support.
Approval of a membership application requires a simple majority vote by the IMF Board of Governors.
Under President Barack Obama, the US is on record as favoring Cuba’s reintegration into the world economy.
As Antonio Damasio argues in his aptly titled book Self Comes to Mind, the brain creates an autobiographical sense of self.
It has a history and a telos.
Likewise, only a new narrative – a new Geist – can persuade the British today that they are really Europeans.
Similarly, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro cannot stop inflation, because the narrative of economic warfare in which he is trapped prevents him from justifying the decisions needed to stabilize prices.
Cuba must explicitly request reinstatement, and a dialogue must be initiated in accordance with the premises of the OAS Charter and other basic OAS documents, and in consonance with the principles on which those documents are based – most importantly, democracy and respect for human rights.
The ALBA group pushed hard for a vote, or a compromise on its terms, which it could then flaunt to the world and to domestic public opinion.
He is a moderate, modern leftist who has openly identified himself with Brazilian President Lula and Barack Obama, as opposed to Chávez.
Curing Hereditary Breast Cancer
This new treatment targets only the tumor cells and is unlikely to affect other healthy cells in the body.
Thus, only the tumor cells will have a non-functional recombination pathway and rely completely on PARP to repair single-strand breaks before copying the DNA.
The reason is simple: cells that have recently lost the functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele and that will later grow into tumors will also be unable to undergo recombination.
Today, every country seems to want to depreciate its currency.
But this would ignore a fundamental asymmetry between advanced and emerging countries.
For both sides, it is more desirable to let the adjustment take place through changes in nominal exchange rates, which would help contain deflation in the north and inflation in the south.
The controversy over China’s exchange-rate policy thus is no mere bilateral US-China trade dispute, but rather a global macroeconomic clash between advanced and emerging countries.
WASHINGTON, DC – Is it appropriate to use trade agreements to discourage countries from using large-scale intervention in the foreign-exchange market to hold down their currencies’ value? That is the question of the day in American economic-policy circles.
The IMF does have up-to-date guidelines that define and seek to prevent currency manipulation.
A well-designed currency chapter in the TPP would not impede US monetary independence.
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, developed economies with floating exchange rates, do not want to encourage currency manipulation.
NEW HAVEN – As the US Congress grapples with the ever-contentious Trans-Pacific Partnership – President Barack Obama’s signature trade legislation – a major stumbling block looms.
America’s net national saving rate – the sum total of household, business, and government saving (adjusted for the depreciation of aging capacity) – currently stands at 2.5% of national income.
In other words, America does not suffer from a small number of bilateral trade deficits that can be tied to charges of currency manipulation by countries like China, Japan, Malaysia, or Singapore.
Lacking any semblance of a strategy to boost savings – not just a long-term fix to the federal government’s budget deficit, but also meaningful incentives for personal saving – US politicians have turned to yet another quick fix.
We can only hope that similar wisdom prevails in the House of Representatives.
But such interventions are complicated – not least because they must account for the relationship between the country’s monetary-policy approach and that of other relevant countries.
The capacity for such adjustments is the hallmark of the flexible exchange-rate system; indeed, for more than four decades, it has proved time and again to be the key to global macroeconomic stability.
He is right.
That is no surprise, as European central bankers are the most conventional in their thinking and have been the most obsessed with inflation.
This is because the destruction of confidence undermines the “animal spirits” of capitalism: borrowers are unwilling to borrow and lenders are unwilling to lend.
To put it another way, spending is financed either by current taxes or through borrowing, and borrowing amounts to future taxes, which have almost the same impact on economic performance as current taxes.
For a given size of government, the method of raising tax revenue matters.
Going over the “fiscal cliff” would have had the attraction of seriously cutting government spending, although the composition of the cuts – nothing from entitlements and too much from defense – was unattractive.
Cyber Insecurity
In the murky world of the Internet, attackers are difficult to identify.
Terrorists, too, can exploit new vulnerabilities in cyberspace to engage in asymmetrical warfare.
That job will not be easy, because much of the relevant infrastructure is not under direct government control.
Given the enormous uncertainties involved, the new cyber dimensions of security must be high on every government’s agenda.
In my book The Future of Power, I argue that the diffusion of power away from governments is one of this century’s great political shifts. &amp; Cyberspace is a perfect example.
A more useful definition of cyber waris hostile action in cyberspace whose effects amplify or are equivalent to major physical violence.
If one treats so-called “hacktivism” by ideological groups as mostly a disruptive nuisance at this stage, there remain four major categories of cyber threats to national security, each with a different time horizon: cyber war and economic espionage are largely associated with states, and cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors.
CAMBRIDGE – Fear of a “cyber Pearl Harbor” first appeared in the 1990s, and for the past two decades, policymakers have worried that hackers could blow up oil pipelines, contaminate the water supply, open floodgates and send airplanes on collision courses by hacking air traffic control systems.
A sophisticated attacker can hide the point of origin behind the false flags of several remote servers.
Not only are governments improving their capabilities, but many private-sector companies are entering the game, and their participation reduces the costs to governments of having to disclose sensitive sources.
Such norms may have deterred the use of cyber weapons in US actions against Iraqi and Libyan air defenses.
Deterrence in the cyber era may not be what it used to be, but maybe it never was.
Clearly, there is a need for rules of the road in cyberspace, and perhaps cyber-power summitry – the US is the Internet technology leader, while China has the largest numbers of users – is the first step in this direction.
Attackers based in China recently broke into the US Office of Personnel Management and stole up to 22 million files with sensitive information on federal employees.
Crucially, it stresses “the need to promote the ‘openness’ in the global data ecosystem and thus the free flow of data across nations, sectors, and organizations.”
The EU must not allow a muddled understanding of digital realities to give rise to profoundly damaging digital protectionism.
On one side are the moral-hazard scolds, claiming that one of the major responsibilities confronting policymakers is to establish incentives that demonstrate that imprudent behavior does not pay.
And letting them learn is precisely what the fight against moral hazard is about.
But this solution was detrimental to financial stability in the rest of Europe, because it signaled that the €100,000 threshold below which deposits are guaranteed was not sacrosanct.
The consequences are already visible: to avoid a complete meltdown, Cyprus has been forced to introduce capital controls – which everyone had thought were illegal and unthinkable within the eurozone.
ATHENS – The Cyprus bailout deal is a watershed in the unfolding eurozone crisis, because responsibility for resolving banks’ problems has been shifted from taxpayers to private investors and depositors.
Privatization, market liberalization, the opening of closed professions, and government downsizing involve conflicts with powerful vested interests, such as businesses in protected industries, public-sector unions, or influential lobbies.
Instead, they emphasized harsh austerity, which was to be pursued everywhere.
The eurozone’s flaws reflect its conceptual distance from the US, which is the only model of a well-functioning monetary union.
Cyprus’s Last Best Chance
The sunny climate of the eastern Mediterranean draws a steady stream of tourists, and European Union membership in the south has pushed income levels for Greek Cypriots higher than the EU average.
When we visited Cyprus late last year, we noticed how few women and young people were engaged in politics.
Third, the major regional powers, whose presence hangs heavily over the island, need to play their part.
BERLIN &#45;&#45; Does history repeat itself, after all? Recent developments in the Middle East suggest that the answer is “yes,” because the situation at the end of President George W. Bush’s tenure increasingly resembles that of Bill Clinton’s final year in the presidency.
But this very political strength is precisely what both the Israeli and Palestinian governments lack.
As the domestic situations in Israel and Palestine have changed, so, too, has the regional political environment changed in a positive direction, because most Arab states today are more afraid of Iran’s regional domination than they are of Israel.
Such an agreement should be implemented gradually, and progress should depend on the parties’ fulfillment of their obligations each step of the way.

सन् 2003 में नार्वे में ऐसी ही स्थिति थी जब स्वास्थ्य व सामाजिक मामलों के मंत्री के तौर पर मैंने सार्वजनिक स्थलों पर धूम्रपान पर पाबंदी लगाने का अभियान चलाया था. उस वक्त इस पाबंदी का घोर विरोध हुआ था और संसार के सबसे घटिया तानाशाहों से मेरी तुलना की जाने लगी थी. पर मैं जानता था कि इस कदम से आने वाले वर्षों में कई जिंदगियां बच जाएंगी. मुझे पूरा विश्वास था कि अगर मैंने कार्यवाई नहीं की तो मतलब था कि मैं अपना काम सही तरीके से नहीं कर रहा था. और इसमें मैं अकेला नहीं था. आयरलैंड के स्वास्थ्य मंत्री मुझसे सहमत थे.
Given that fossil fuels are the lifeblood of the global economy, nobody has clean hands – and those who wish to lead the battle against global warming risk attracting the charge of hypocrisy.
Americans may love stories about individual change and redemption, but the global poor – who will be the principal victims of global warming – are more interested in what we do than in the state of our souls.
This sense is reinforced when environmentalists forgive their favorite billionaire for his involvement in the fossil-fuel industry and refer to him as if he was just another guy who changed his mind about which car to drive.
Mir-Hossein Mousavi, chosen by the late Ayatollah Khomeini to be prime minister in 1981, was such a figure.
Communists always had a tendency to dismiss the differences between candidates in liberal democracies (let alone “managed” ones).
Still, if voting confers dignity on citizens, participation in a fraud is humiliating.
Mousavi was regarded by many Iranians as a second chance.
Ahmedinejad won the election, but the regime is weakened as a result.
Official responses to the global economic crisis highlight the interventionist model’s merits, proving that decisive government action can help to enhance efficiency and clear unbalanced markets, thereby protecting the economy from the demand shortfall caused by falling investment and rising unemployment.
Many blame the crisis on the decades-long ascendancy of a laissez faire approach to economic policymaking, and rightly credit government intervention with facilitating recovery.
And Hayek found it “reassuring” to know that he and Keynes agreed “so completely.”
The G-20 recognized in 2008 that unfettered finance can generate costly crises; thus, it decided to re-regulate finance.
Prohibition of certain transactions for prudential reasons also makes sense, particularly for borrowing in foreign currencies by economic agents that do not have revenues in those currencies.
Moreover (and again counter to the guidelines), CFMs, almost by definition, require some discrimination between residents and non-residents.
Damming China’s Rivers
The sun was high above white-crowned Jade Dragon Snow Mountain when my guide pointed down the gorge at the brown waters churning thousands of feet below.
Yet the costs may outweigh the benefits.
These efforts appear to have catalyzed greater environmental sensitivity among the country’s leaders.
When boundaries were negotiated for Three Parallel Rivers Park – designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003 – local authorities won a fight to exclude Tiger Leaping Gorge, knowing that a dam there would triple tax revenues.
In the advanced countries, dissatisfaction with government stems from its inability to deliver effective economic policies for growth and inclusion.
Moreover, policymakers often hide behind (real or imagined) competitive pressures emanating from the global economy to justify their lack of responsiveness to popular demands, and cite the same pressures when implementing unpopular policies such as fiscal austerity.
And, for many economists, delegating economic policy to technocratic bodies in order to insulate them from the “folly of the masses” almost always is the preferred approach.
As long as the military remains the ultimate political arbiter, these groups focus their strategies on the military rather than one another.
If these words ring true today, perhaps it is because when they were written, in 1926, inequality in the United States had reached heights comparable to today.
Exhibit A for Surowiecki is Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and CEO of the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, whose wealth now exceeds $10 billion.
In periods of relative calm, governments’ role in writing and upholding the rules by which markets function can become obscured.
It is the government that enacts and enforces the copyright, patent, and trademark laws that protect intellectual property rights, guaranteeing successful innovators a steady stream of monopoly profits.
Led by China, scores of emerging and developing countries have registered record-high growth rates over recent decades, setting precedents for others to follow.
Obviously, not all countries can run trade surpluses at the same time.
But recipient economies are vulnerable to financial-market sentiment and sudden capital flight – as happened recently when investors anticipated monetary-policy tightening in the United States.
In an optimal world, the surpluses of countries pursuing export-led growth would be willingly matched by the deficits of those pursuing debt-led growth.
PRINCETON – We live in a complicated world, so we are forced to simplify it.
The best that social science has to offer is in fact not much different.
Stylized historical analogies often play a similar role.
So how should we choose among alternative simplifications of reality?
Foxes carry competing, possibly incompatible theories in their heads.
The trials were stage-managed by Gülenist police, prosecutors, and media.
The new line is that these trials were marred by irregularities, that there had been a plot against the military, and that the Gülenists have established a state within the state.
At the time, I wrote that if he did not change course, “the country will descend deeper into authoritarianism, political divisions will become irreconcilable, and yet another political rupture may become inevitable.”
His supporters have been launching smear campaigns against Gülenists that are reminiscent of Gülenist tactics.
When viewed in isolation, the preferences of the “average” voter – that is, a voter in the middle of the income distribution – seem to have a strongly positive influence on the government’s ultimate response.
Gilens and Page report similar results for organized interest groups, which wield a powerful influence on policy formation.
When politics is waged on these grounds, elections are won by those who are most successful at “priming” our latent cultural and psychological markers, not those who best represent our interests.
Widening inequality in the world’s advanced and developing countries thus inflicts two blows against democratic politics.
Little of this process is taking place in Africa. As researchers at the African Center for Economic Transformation in Accra, Ghana, put it, the continent is “growing rapidly, transforming slowly.”
Consider Rwanda, a much-heralded success story where GDP has increased by a whopping 9.6% per year, on average, since 1995 (with per capita incomes rising at an annual rate of 5.2%).
Half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population is under 25 years of age. According to the World Bank, each year an additional five million turn 15, “crossing the threshold from childhood to adulthood.”
The economists were virtually unanimous.
No doubt, there are many public-policy questions that economists debate vigorously. What should the top income-tax rate be?
Moreover, it requires that economists make value judgments on distributional effects, which are better left to the electorate itself.
A recent example is the failure of economists to grasp the dangerous confluence of circumstances that produced the global financial crisis.
Because China is now the world’s largest exporter after the European Union, and accounts for about half of global growth, decisions taken in Beijing could have a more important impact on the world economy than those taken in Berlin, Brussels, or Washington, DC.
Network industries like telecoms, gas, electricity, and water tend to become monopolistic or oligopolistic if left to market forces alone.
Instead of large-scale privatization, it might be better to limit state aid and give competitors legal recourse to seek redress if state aid distorts competition.
What Makes Greece Special?
This lackluster performance, which followed years of decline in market shares, is difficult to explain, given that all other countries on the eurozone periphery recorded solid export growth.
On the contrary, many indicators of efficiency of the way the government and the labor market work have actually deteriorated.
Greece now has a balanced current account – quite an achievement after double-digit deficits (as a percentage of GDP) a few years ago.
Missing this target is what has set Greece apart.
Even taking into account the increasing demographic differential, which now amounts to about half a percentage point per year, the US economy has grown by about 4.5 percentage points more over these three years on a per capita basis.
But the crucial question – and one that is rarely asked – is how US households were able to reduce their debt burden during a period of high unemployment and almost no wage gains while sustaining consumption growth.
In the US, by contrast, the corresponding period lasts less than one year in most cases.
Restarting Ukraine’s Economy
The first steps are already being taken, with the authorities recently announcing that household gas prices will rise by 50% next month.
In the case of eastern Ukraine, winning the support of those who are still nostalgic for the “good old days” must go beyond creating productive jobs that fill their wallets.
Here the EU can also play a prominent role by recognizing Russia’s special interest in proper pipeline maintenance and a proper accounting for the gas they carry.
And the new European Commission looks rather strong, given that more than 20 of its 28 members previously served as prime ministers, deputy prime ministers, or ministers.
The experience of the previous incumbent, former Belgian Prime Minister Herman van Rompuy, in dealing with his own country’s fractious coalitions proved very useful when he had to persuade national leaders to make decisions during the euro crisis.
But there is at least one encouraging, if hidden, signal from Mogherini’s appointment: The fact that the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is also an Italian was not an impediment.
BRUSSELS – The European Union has finally agreed on its “third-level sanctions” against Russia for its actions in Ukraine.
In fact, a large proportion of Russian imports from the EU are precisely of these generic consumer goods, which are not affected by sanctions.
Why?
The freedom and rule of law provided by financial centers such as London will become even more attractive.
In the run-up to the election, the major European party “families” (there are no pan-European parties, only loose alliances of national parties) each nominated a Spitzenkandidat as their choice for President of the European Commission.
The other extreme is Italy, where the S&D won 41% of the votes, versus 22% for the EPP. In absolute terms, the difference was more than five million votes, but the S&D won only 14 more MEPs than the EPP.
Europe Is Still Standing
In Europe’s crisis-affected countries, young people, who have been hardest hit, voted en masse for leftist “anti-austerity” parties, most notably in Greece.
But these facts do not count when wages are stagnating (as in the UK) or unemployment continues to rise (as in France).
The EU does not have a significant budget, and it sets at most a general framework for economic and social rules that vary widely across a large and diverse continent.
Ortega’s display of raw power is thus merely a reminder of his autocratic ways.
In the context of the new Latin American left, Ortega resembles a shoddy imitation of Fidel Castro without the oil wealth of Hugo Chávez.
Alemán, too, faces a rebellion in his Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC), led by former Treasury Minister Eduardo Montealegre, a presidential hopeful popular in the party’s liberal wing. If Alemán blocks Montealegre’s candidacy in the PLC and pushes him to form another political party, Ortega’s chances for winning the presidency increase sharply.
If voters continue to lean toward Lewites and Montealegre, the two candidates could elect more deputies to the National Assembly than the Sandinistas and the PLC combined.
Compared to previous global downturns triggered by a financial crisis, the global economy bounced back robustly.
This ignorance matters when political commentators try to write about the global economy.
Another common reason for the collective misperception is misplaced nostalgia.
It is a general rule of political science that a faltering economy causes greater distrust in institutions.
If pundits continue to insist that the system failed, wonks will devote time and effort to figuring out how to fix what is not broken.
But Japan’s problems are not unique.
A concomitant feature of South Korea’s labor market is that women’s labor-force participation rate – a paltry 33% for women aged 30-39 – is among the lowest in the OECD.
Moreover, despite South Korea’s dependence on exports, domestic consumption is robust.
While increased immigration could help to ease labor-force pressures, it would be met with public resistance.
With almost perfect synchronization, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced the end of the war on Gaza in a televised broadcast from his Ramallah headquarters, while Hamas leaders called on Palestinians in Gaza to take to the streets to celebrate their supposed victory.
Having withstood the test of war, the Palestinian unity government that was created less than two months before the conflict began will now become the main vehicle for Gaza’s reconstruction.
Just as the international community isolated South Africa until it abandoned apartheid, it can put pressure on Israel through boycotts, divestment, and sanctions, while calling upon Israel’s allies to stop providing aid and arms.
But the unprecedented period of coordinated loose monetary policy since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008 could be just as problematic.
Once returns on commercial paper had been driven to all-time lows, investors continued to push into equities.
But at some point, a real market correction will arrive.
The new Lords of Finance have arguably been successful in many of their objectives since the financial crisis erupted seven years ago.
Villages have been emptied, women raped, non-Arab men killed.
Such thinking is inadequate and outmoded.
And weak governments should not be allowed to permit massacres to take place on their own territory even if they are not themselves carrying out the massacre.
What needs doing? There is a need for massive assistance to the displaced people of Darfur.
Darkness or Dawn in Belarus?
Whatever its past successes in maintaining basic living standards, today it is evident that Belarus cannot match its neighbors’ dynamism.
Yet now, Lukashenko wishes to harness entrepreneurship and foreign direct investment in a bid to modernize the economy.
Belarusians currently pay €60 for an EU tourist visa, which is a major obstacle in view of low wages. Poland has announced that it will grant Belarusians visas at no cost, while denying visas to a long list of regime officials that it says were involved in the recent electoral fraud.
In fact, his work revolutionized the field.
Peacocks have evolved to have long, colorful feathers simply because peahens have evolved to find them attractive.
Sigmund Freud never met Darwin, but most of his mentors were enthusiastic Darwinists. Just as Isaac Newton revolutionized astronomy and physics by “standing on the shoulders” of his predecessors, Freud built on Darwin’s evolutionary insights in order to understand psychological symptoms, dreams, myths, art, anthropology, and much more.
My plans changed, however, when my father got ill.
More than two million people were dying from tuberculosis, because they lacked access to low-cost, first-line treatment.
The Global Fund also plays a critical role in strengthening health care in developing countries.
I hope that others with the means to support its work will invest so wisely.
Without Britain, they would be bossed around by France, and even more so by Germany. And yet, as memories of World War II fade, more and more people in the Netherlands and Scandinavia feel content to be under Germany’s powerful wings.
The French who said they wanted Britain to leave the EU were largely on the left, while many who held the opposite view were further to the right.
Hence the typical EU language about “unstoppable trains” and “irreversible decisions”: citizens are not supposed to question the wisdom of great planners.
Those who favor European unification should take criticisms of its political flaws very seriously.
The British cuts reveal a push in developed countries – one that also started in the US – to target the kinds of education that lead to an open, vigorous civil society and a population that is hard to suppress.
That Britain will look more like the US of today.

Perhaps voters have just as much of a problem with foreigners as they do with freeloaders.
He is now making it seem as if immigration will be the key test of that effort.
It sounds a bit technical, and it is.
The discussion has thus turned to the possibility of providing the UK with a special status or allowing it to opt out of more EU provisions.
By contrast, her German counterpart, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, often regarded as one of that generation’s preeminent European champions, offered only lukewarm support for the Single European Act. He preferred to help steer Europe toward monetary and political union, just when its economy had begun to fall behind the rest of the world.
European integration in the shadow of WWII was a wise and magnificent achievement.
For example, a case study of the United Kingdom for 1997-2007 – a period of full inflation targets and policy independence for the Bank of England (BoE) – indicates considerable improvement from a poor starting point.
But central banks have pursued multiple objectives simultaneously, without bringing about bad outcomes or destroying their own credibility.
A Long-Term Plan for Syria’s Refugees
In Turkey, an estimated 200,000 refugees are in official camps, but at least twice that number are struggling alone in towns and cities.
Instead, a more informal system, supported by networks of local and refugee teachers – a model that was successfully pioneered in Congo and Afghanistan – can provide accredited learning.



Saving General Petraeus
They also see a country that truly does reflect the world, attracting immigrants from every nation and giving them an equal chance to succeed as Americans.
In our cynical age, many might scoff at such an old-fashioned motto (or, indeed, at the power of any motto or slogan).
The hubbub of tawdry disclosures and investigations addressing every aspect of a widening scandal may well last for weeks.


A New Progressive Political Economy
These include the institutions underpinning its financial and labor markets, its corporate-governance arrangements, its education and training system, and its national system of innovation (the network of public and private institutions that initiate and diffuse new technologies).
This is because it is difficult to devise practical and effective policies to achieve equality in a market economy.
A Wrong Turn for Human Rights
New UN-backed international and hybrid tribunals were created to bring to account perpetrators of atrocities in the Balkans, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Cambodia.
For example, justice and human rights are at the heart of the historic peace talks in Colombia.
NEW YORK – For 15 years, I have attended the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Central bankers’ belief that controlling inflation was necessary and almost sufficient for growth and prosperity had never been based on sound economic theory; now, the crisis provided further skepticism.
Worse still, much of the money flowing into the banks to recapitalize them so that they could resume lending has been flowing out in the form of bonus payments and dividends.
Moreover, developing countries lack the resources to engage in the massive stimulus policies of the advanced countries.  Making matters worse, the IMF still forces most countries that turn to it for help to raise interest rates and lower spending, worsening the downturns.
LONDON – By coincidence, this is a busy year for round-number anniversaries for France’s greatest leader since Napoleon.
But, by 1960, euphoria had given way to rancor among those whom he had used to regain office but who now saw him as a traitor to be neutralized along with the regime he had brought into being.
An official who saw him in the corridor of the palace recalled him muttering: “What a business!
Insisting that self-determination was the only way ahead, he called on the army to reject even passive association with the insurrection and instructed it to re-establish public order.
An opinion poll gave the General 75% backing.
Kurdish forces recently succeeded, after months of heavy fighting, in expelling the Islamic State from the border town of Kobane.
De Mistura's plan aims to stabilize the situation by shifting the policy focus away from a relentless military campaign – an approach that is benefiting only the Islamic State.
Support by the United States for de Mistura's initiative symbolizes a quiet – and constructive – shift by President Barack Obama's administration from its demand that Assad step down immediately.
The stability of the region and the lives (and what is left of the livelihoods) of the Syrian people depend on it.
In May of this year, Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi will replace another Italian, the retiring Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa.
After all, member governments would still pick the candidates, and there can be no escaping politics in what is essentially a political process.
Many of the new members will be small countries who will introduce the euro someday and will want to have a seat on the Executive Board.
Increasingly, political leaders like British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who spoke eloquently for the Round at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, are emphasizing that the Doha Round’s failure would cost the world significant gains in prosperity, halt progress for the poor in developing countries, and reduce workers’ real incomes in developed countries.
Even during his campaign for the Democratic Party nomination, when his main rival, Hillary Clinton, was pushing to suspend trade negotiations and had embraced the protectionist narrative, Obama kept his cool and promised instead to reopen NAFTA – a tactic designed to amount to nothing, as it has.
Regrettably, neither they nor the President have asked that Doha also be put into the bag.
So the truth is out and freely available.
Even America’s vaunted judicial system has failed to constrain obvious abuses.
The Bush administration has created a transnational apparatus of lawlessness that he alone, without global intervention, can neither roll back nor control.
Many studies have shown that tying investment to democracy and human rights reform is effective in the developing world.
Maybe then I can fall in love with my country again.
Perhaps 150 million young adults will be killed by tobacco in these two countries alone, unless there is widespread cessation.
In many countries, tobacco taxes have fallen in real terms.
Smuggling is abetted by the tobacco industry in order to gain market share and scare finance ministers into lowering taxes.
The Gates Foundation can fund action and research.
But, in a world where China links its currency to the dollar at an under-valued parity, the dollar’s depreciation risks major global economic damage that will further complicate recovery from the current worldwide recession.
But China retains its under-valued exchange rate policy, so that the renminbi has appreciated relatively less against the dollar.
With China retaining its under-valued currency policy, dollar depreciation can aggravate global deflationary forces.
Death in Lhasa
Tied to that sense of due process of law is a call for the Chinese leadership to allow representatives of the international community to have access to Tibet and its adjoining provinces.
The Supreme Court even held an emergency hearing at 2:30 in the morning, just hours before the execution was set to occur, before deciding to allow it to proceed.
The Supreme Court has declared that the death penalty should be applied only in the “rarest of the rare” cases.
Of those, 280 were commuted to life imprisonment, with many of the other cases likely to remain in limbo for decades.
Moreover, it has been suggested that the alternative to the death penalty – life imprisonment – would make India vulnerable to hijackings and other assaults by terrorist groups attempting to free their jailed comrades.
For now, India remains blind to the case for abolishing the death penalty.
Does it refer to the geopolitics of international relations, or to protecting society against terrorist attacks? It is both, of course, but the sort of policies that will achieve these two very different objectives is far from clear.
Of the two million men and women in EU countries’ armed forces, only 2% are combat ready.

A further $3 billion in credits for European post-war reconstruction cemented America’s status as the world’s premier creditor nation, with its surplus equal to roughly 8% of GNP at the time.
Yet, even without the gold standard, America’s economic might, together with the recycling of petrodollars, kept the dollar on top.
And it is in America’s public debt that the debris of its financial system’s broken promises are collected, just as Italy’s massive public debt reflects its past national prodigality.
Debt and Delusion
That would clearly be nonsense.
At any time in history, the debt-to-annual-GDP ratio (including informal debts) would vastly exceed 100%.
But the ratio is not the cause of the feedback.
They are asking governments to cut expenditure while their economies are still vulnerable.
After all, Hungary still holds the world record for hyperinflation, with the currency debased by 1027 in the 1940’s, paving the way for the imposition of Communist dictatorship.
A constitutional approach limited the scope for wasteful spending on luxurious court life (and on military adventure), which had been the hallmark of early modern autocratic monarchy.
He explicitly went back to the legacy of Napoleon, and argued that France could be stable only with a strong currency.
Similarly, in guaranteeing the debt of Irish banks in September 2008, the Irish government did something that no responsible government should have contemplated.
Servicing these debts will most likely become increasingly difficult over the coming years, especially if growth continues to stagnate, interest rates begin to rise, export opportunities remain subdued, and the collapse in commodity prices persists.
When a government is unable to pay, the only solution is direct negotiations.
The core principles – those under discussion include sovereignty, legitimacy, impartiality, transparency, good faith, and sustainability principles – currently would apply to all debt instruments and could provide greater coordination than market-based approaches.
Both revelations underscore China’s preference for strategic subterfuge.
At the end of a recent visit to Beijing with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, Mukhtar reported that the Chinese government was more than happy to oblige whatever requests for assistance the Pakistani side made, including reaching an agreement to take over operation of the Gwadar port after the existing contract with a Singaporean government company expires. China also made a gift to Pakistan of 50 JF-17 fighter jets.
But the insurgency is no barrier to China’s use of Gwadar to project power in the Middle East and East Africa, and against peninsula India.
On the other hand, refusing to accept the growing consensus that fiscal union is the key to resolving the debt crisis exposes the eurozone, and Germany, to serious risks.
The eurozone’s dilemmas, and the pros and cons of proposed solutions, can be debated endlessly.
Of course, in the midst of so much uncertainty, it is remarkable that the over-indebted countries’ consolidation efforts remain broadly on track; but the European Central Bank’s continued bond-buying and liquidity support is only a temporary palliative.
MILAN – In the dog days of summer, Milan is quieter than many European cities.
And yet much of the current uncertainty is set to dissipate.
Part-time employment is spreading and may become the labor market’s new normal.
In Italy, the debate centers on taxes in general, and the rather miniscule property tax in particular.
Fortunately, this uncomfortable uncertainty will not last much longer – in Europe or elsewhere.
I was in Perm, a city in the Urals, to take part in a seminar of the Moscow School of Political Studies.
The prisoners slept on wooden planks or iron bunks.
Their expressions were as frozen as the ground outside.
This represents a major shift from Russia’s early post-Soviet days.
Expanding NATO into the Baltic States in 2002 – the Alliance’s first enlargement into former Soviet territory – was a catastrophic mistake, which made it almost impossible for a Russian to be both patriotic and pro-Western.
NEW YORK – I am a macroeconomist, but I dissent from the profession’s two leading camps in the United States: the neo-Keynesians, who focus on boosting aggregate demand, and the supply-siders, who focus on cutting taxes.
Indeed, according to this view, spending is spending.
In the European Union, the decline was from 24% of GDP in 1990 to 18.1% in 2013.
Neo-Keynesians see investments, public and private, as merely another kind of aggregate demand.
Such a policy would put US private saving to important use in fighting global poverty, while strengthening the US industrial base.
CAMBRIDGE – With the approach of the US Congressional elections, questions about the health of America’s political institutions and the future of its global leadership have become rampant, with some citing partisan gridlock as evidence of America’s decline.
This inefficiency has likely contributed to the decline in confidence in American institutions.
Americans may not be entirely satisfied with their leaders, but the country is certainly not on the brink of an Arab Spring-style revolution.
In fact, gridlock in the national capital is often accompanied by political cooperation and innovation at the state and municipal levels, leading citizens to view state and local governments, as well as many government agencies, much more favorably than the federal government.
DAKAR – France is wrestling with a burden of debts and public deficits that led Standard &amp; Poor’s recently to downgrade its credit rating.
The CFA franc was sharply devalued in 1994, and outstanding debts& were& reduced.
Since 2000, sub-Saharan African countries’ annual GDP growth has averaged 5-7%, compared to 2.5-3% for the franc zone.
France may not like it, but the best interests& of the franc zone’s citizens should come first.
Resignations have increased: ambassadors, ministers, significant media figures, and army generals.
Perhaps more remarkably, in a country containing more than 12 million guns, the protesters have not fired a shot.
The reality is that the US has known for weeks that it cannot save Saleh’s regime.
Defaulting to Big Government
If the US government defaults, however, all of them will “break the buck,” meaning that they will be unable to maintain the principal value of the money that has been placed with them.
With the debt ceiling unchanged, this would require some legal sleight of hand. But the alternative would clearly be a collapse of US national security – soldiers and border guards have to be paid, the transportation system must operate, and so on.
Now they claim to have manufactured nuclear weapons for self-defense.
Like Japan, the Bush administration’s relatively moderate stance toward North Korea has changed since the talks broke down last year.
If North Korea is, indeed, continuing to develop not only its nuclear arsenal, but also various types of ballistic missiles, in defiance of international commitments, it is truly a rogue state.
But some important developments that foreigners decry as the result of government intervention are in fact the opposite.
Unification of onshore and offshore markets is more important than a floating exchange rate in determining whether the International Monetary Fund will include the renminbi in the basket of currencies used to determine the value of its reserve asset, the Special Drawing Right.
It seems clear that the extraordinary run-up in equity prices was fueled by a surge in margin financing of stock purchases, which was legalized in 2010-2011 and encouraged by the PBOC’s monetary easing since last November.
Nor is the fact that the PBOC’s interventions in the foreign-exchange market over the last year have aimed to dampen the renminbi’s depreciation, not add to it.
In other words, Japan will clearly assert its will to defend the nation, and to prevent invasion in combination with the Japan-US security system.
Japan’s ground forces are to reorient their current structure, which is geared to combat capability in response to large-scale invasion, toward increased adaptability for military action in less severe circumstances.
But they must do so in a way that provides genuine direction, and that Japan’s people, military, and neighbors find convincing.
This weakness is what forced German Chancellor Angela Merkel to bully her European Union partners into a more coherent response to the ongoing influx of asylum-seekers.
These formal policy discussions between the IMF and member governments, typically carried out annually, are written up, reviewed by the Fund’s Board of Executive Directors (representing all 188 governments), and published for anyone to read online.
Its resources dwarf the sums that the international community can mobilize for other issues, because its money is lent and is supposed to be paid back.
With the collapse in the price of oil since then, the economy has gone into a tailspin: GDP is contracting at a record pace, inflation is in excess of 200%, the currency has plunged to less than 10% of its previous value, and massive shortages have emerged.
PARIS – Despite the frequency with which the phrase “international community” is invoked, its precise meaning – like its origins – is difficult to discern.
So countries began to deepen and develop international law by building shared institutions.
On the contrary, all international negotiations – on global warming, financial regulation, and nuclear disarmament (despite the efforts of US President Barack Obama and former Russian President Dmitri Medvedev to conclude a bilateral nuclear-disarmament agreement) – launched since the end of the twentieth century have failed.
Moreover, in accordance with its regulations and practices, the UN has called for a presidential election, which has now been set for July 28.
PRINCETON – The history of finance is partly the history of a struggle for a stable, secure way to measure value.
Consequently, many economists and politicians concluded that paper money could be more easily controlled and more stable.
Deflation that emanates from the financial sector is lethal.
The political response to deflation is to call for a stronger state.
Indeed, as governments scramble to respond to the current crisis, we should remember that deflation tends to produce not only radical anti-capitalism, but also a profound hostility to any kind of economic or political organization.
If that happens, a homeowner with a mortgage would see the real value of his debt rise by 10%.
The resulting unusual economic environment of falling prices and wages can also have a damaging psychological impact on households and businesses. With deflation, we are heading into unknown territory.
Ironically, although central banks are now focused on the problem of deflation, the more serious risk for the longer term is that inflation will rise rapidly as their economies recover and banks use the large volumes of recently accumulated reserves to create loans that expand spending and demand.
All these provocations add upward pressure on oil prices, enriching the Iranian government.
Oil prices have fallen from above $78 per barrel in mid-July to less than $60 in early October.
Washington can also press the Saudis, who control virtually all of the world’s spare capacity, to keep their output high to contain prices.
Easing tensions will not win Bush points with those who prefer a muscular strategy.
The pipeline has been established as a Russian-German-Dutch consortium, but it is the Russian energy giant Gazprom that is in the driver’s seat with 51% of the shares.
They seem to regard the case as a “technical issue,” and are now satisfied because environmental guarantees have been given.
Last year’s experience with interrupted gas supplies did have one benefit: new life was blown into plans for alternative routes, like the Nabucco pipeline that is to bring Azeri gas to Europe through Turkey.
TOKYO – China’s refusal to attend this year’s summit with Japan and South Korea as scheduled comes at a trying moment for all three countries.
While the threat may not affect them equally, none can afford a misstep.
Unfortunately, key groups in all three countries claim that the contest for regional mastery now underway means that talk about cooperation is not only naïve, but obsolete.
Instead, China should openly confront those neighbors with which it has disputed claims.
Crisis management is no way to sustain relationships that are economically close but riddled by rival claims and bitterly contested historical narratives.
No one should be under any illusions.
But the road to global nuclear disarmament will be long and bumpy.
As supplementary steps, the report suggests negotiating limitations on missiles, strategic missile defense, space-based weapons, and biological weapons, as well as holding talks on eliminating conventional weapons imbalances."
But the sole purpose of retaining some degree of deterrence will be to deter the use of nuclear weapons.
Some traditional leaders, academics, representatives of civil-society groups, and students, on the other hand, were more worried about whether the country’s new oil wealth would benefit ordinary people.
But it must be ready to make some tough choices – and study the region’s existing success stories.
Speaking of the lost decade of the 1980’s in Africa, Mazrui observed that, despite being endowed with superb climatic conditions, few African countries could feed themselves; likewise, despite being engaged in trade in minerals and cash crops, most countries still wallowed in a state of aid-dependency.
The origin of this malaise lies in the creation of excessive debt to fund real-estate investment and construction.
Collapsing external demand in late 2008 therefore threatened Chinese growth and employment.
Faced with mediocre growth and near-zero inflation, the eurozone may also now consider yet more QE.
Buoyant domestic demand might offset the deflationary impact on the US economy, but only if interest rates stay low enough to stimulate a resurgence of private credit growth, potentially taking us full circle, to the kind of run-up in leverage that preceded the 2008 crisis.
The Federal Reserve is of a similar mind, not only maintaining rock-bottom short-term interest rates, but also embarking on an adventurous policy targeting long-term rates.
From the trough of the recession, the economy recovered the lost jobs in eight months on average.
Regardless of what the right explanation is, the history of recent recessions suggests that we should not be surprised that the job recovery is taking time.
In other words, were it not for construction, the US unemployment rate would be 6.5% – a far healthier situation than today.
It is a discussion in which the supporting evidence seems to have oscillated from one side to the other in recent decades. In the 1980s, economic performance in Chile, under General Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship, and in Singapore, under the more benign but nonetheless authoritarian Lee Kuan Yew, was impressive.
The seemingly endless euro crisis has led some European leaders to give credence to that viewpoint. At the start of the crisis, Jean-Claude Juncker, now President of the European Commission, is reputed to have said, “We all know what to do, we just don’t know how to get re-elected after we’ve done it.”
Whether at the European level or in individual member states, the authority for ensuring long-term economic growth should be precisely and clearly delegated to agencies that derive their legitimacy from the democratic process, while being protected from its baser whims.
In parts of New Jersey, many people fortunate enough still to have a house are cut off by rivers of raw sewage lapping at their doors.
There is something to be said for this attitude.
And, two years after the earthquake in L’Aquila in 2009, which killed hundreds of people, nothing much had been done to reconstruct the city, despite an initial flurry of publicity stunts showing Berlusconi, posing in a fireman’s hat, personally taking charge.
And, sometimes, radical changes are made, even in democracies, though a severe crisis often is required to mobilize voters behind a collective push for essential reform, as was true of the Great Depression in the 1930’s, which led to Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal.
The totality is based on a series of complex relationships that connect legal and illegal worlds, including politicians, judges, and prosecutors who are willing to alter sentences for money; policemen and military personnel involved in illegal activities; and businessmen who launder money.
Given the near-absence of legal forms of mediation, violence is the language used by criminal networks to resolve disputes.
This is a far nobler calling than simply expanding American hegemony.
Modern technology makes it easy to have a paper trail for voting machines, at little cost; yet several states chose not to provide this minimal safeguard.
The decision to go to war in Iraq is the most dramatic example of this, but there have been many others in America under Bush.
Yet under Bush, the US has undermined basic civil rights, such as habeas corpus, which guarantees individuals recourse to judicial review when the state detains them.
The US administration is determined to consolidate political freedoms in many developing countries under its sphere of influence; indeed, expansion of democracy has become a cornerstone of American foreign policy.
Whatever the reason for the observed positive cross-country correlation between income and democracy, it should not be confused with causality.
This applies to the episodes of democratization in Latin America and the Philippines in the mid-1980’s, but also to Turkey in the early 1980’s and Nepal in 1990.
Economic liberalism came first, political liberalism later.
There is no doubt that Egyptian society is deeply divided along sectarian, ideological, class, and regional lines. Yet the country has gone to the polls several times since the February 2011 overthrow of Mubarak’s 30-year rule.
After the Islamist parties’ huge victory in the 2011-2012 parliamentary elections, the military leadership and the Supreme Court (filled with Mubarak-era judges) worked to derail the new parliament and prevent it from establishing an assembly to draft a new constitution.
Historically, outside parties have thus played a decisive role.
They represent a large part of Egypt’s population, perhaps half or more, and are certainly the country’s best-organized political force.
It has been, and is, playing a vital role in post-conflict reconstruction around the world.
The American president would choose the Bank’s head, and Europe would collectively decide on the IMF leader, with the understanding that the other side would exercise its veto only if a candidate were totally unacceptable.
Of course, some past appointees turned out to be far better than anticipated; they rose to the occasion, despite qualifications that, in any open and objective selection process, would never even have left them on the short list.
Democracy in Tea Party America
To the “sick” France of 1835, Tocqueville counterposed healthy America, where attachment to the idea that people should pursue their self-interest was no less strong, but was different.
The connection between the general interest and the private interest of individual Americans has, if anything, become much stronger, even if their private interest is tied to a post office box in the Cayman Islands.
Otherwise, Tocqueville would surely say of Americans today what he said of the French then.
Mubarak, after all, is already in his 24th year as president.
The government’s heavy-handed behavior reinvigorated the homegrown “Kifaya” (Enough) movement, which has demanded an end to the Mubarak regime.
As a measure of sincerity, he needs to order the immediate release of Ayman Nour and take steps to terminate the 24-year-long state of emergency, which effectively prevents political campaigning from taking place.
For example: on January 1, 2010, I think to myself that the game will soon be up for the Greeks.
My profit for correctly taking this bearish view is therefore €1.65m – the €9.1m I got by selling the bonds when I borrowed them on January 1, minus the €7.2m that I had to pay to repurchase them on June 30, minus the €250,000 in interest that I had to pay Goldman Sachs for the six-month loan.
But they do no such thing.
Popular anger at budget cuts imposed at the behest of speculators and bankers has toppled leaders in Ireland and Portugal, and is forcing the Spanish prime minister into retirement.
Opposition parties should refrain from shorting their government politically at a time when markets are doing so financially.
While elections are important, liberal democracy is more than “electocracy.”
The desire for greater participation is widespread as economies develop and people adjust to modernization.
For example, many people both inside and outside the United States had become cynical about the American political system, arguing that it was dominated by money and closed to outsiders.
When some of the Bush administration’s more reasonable members are asked today how they could have taken the positions they did in 2002, they cite the anthrax attacks that followed 9/11, the intelligence reports of an impending attack with nuclear materials, and the widespread fear of a second attack against the American people.
The idea seems counterintuitive: How can less produce more?
Had Cortés’s strategy failed, he would have gone down in history – if he was remembered at all – as an arrogant fool who thought that he could defeat a great empire.
The diffusion of these mechanisms raises the issue of democracy.
When a government starts to borrow abroad or chooses to enter a currency union, these benefits take the form of reduced interest rates.
The result is that the euro, sold as a way to integrate Europe further, is tearing it apart.
In the eyes of many critics at home and abroad, the Bush administration’s excesses tarnished the idea of democracy promotion.
When we live up to our own best traditions, we can stimulate emulation and generate the soft power of attraction. This approach is what Ronald Reagan called the “shining city on the hill.”
Terrorism is a form of theater. It works not by sheer destruction, but rather by dramatizing atrocious acts against civilians.
Hazare fasted to force the government to create a tough new anti-corruption authority, the Lokpal, with sweeping powers to investigate, prosecute, and punish.
This is an essential part of promoting governmental accountability between elections.
Their claim to represent the people, whose votes they have sought and won, cannot be lightly disregarded in favor of those who have not earned the right to represent the people through a democratic election.
Democracy versus the Eurozone
But, in the end, the “people” remain the real sovereign, and they can choose to ignore their governments’ promises and reject any adjustment program from “Brussels.”
But who guarantees that these rules will actually be followed? François Hollande’s victory over Sarkozy in France’s presidential election shows that an apparent consensus on the need for austerity can crumble quickly.
Financial markets have reacted as strongly as they have because investors recognize that the “sovereign” in sovereign debt is an electorate that can simply decide not to pay.
Admiration for American values does not mean, of course, that others want to imitate all the ways Americans implement them. While many Europeans admire America's devotion to freedom, they prefer policies at home that temper the liberal economic principles of individualism with a robust welfare state.
America is not perfect, but as long as it abides by its core values, it can overcome its mistakes and regain its soft power in democratic countries.
As Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has put it, "The issues should determine the coalition, rather than the coalition determining the issues."
Democracy cannot be imposed in any reasonable time by force alone.
Were it not for such imitative consumption, non-rich households would have saved, on average, more than $800 annually in recent years.
The obvious lesson to be drawn from these episodes is the importance of unintended consequences.
Indeed, once the unintended consequences of their actions – more financial duress for the non-rich after the crisis – became clear, Bertrand and Morse show that the legislators in unequal districts moved against the financial sector to protect their constituents, voting to set limits on interest rates charged by “payday” lenders (who lend to over-indebted lower-income borrowers at very high interest rates).
The summit’s purpose is to take stock of successes and failures, and to move towards “concrete strategies for action.”
Addressing these issues is vital for development objectives to have any chance to succeed.
Accountability mechanisms should be established, allowing victims to hold governments responsible for their failure to take action.
Europe and other developed economies are aging as well, owing to low fertility rates and increasing longevity.
From 1950 to 2050, Uganda’s population will have increased 20-fold, and Niger’s 30-fold.
Population stabilization reduces pressure on environmental assets such as unspoiled countryside, which people value more as their incomes increase.
The actual figure could be many times that.
Sadly, this is not true in many other places.
What is already clear, however, is that, like previous transformations, this one will involve a fundamental change in all of our economic relations and the social relations that support them.
Where this social glue is lacking – such as between Israelis and Palestinians – people cannot exploit all of the available economic opportunities.
People’s social allegiances are divided further by religion, race, occupation, gender, and even income bracket.
Instead of choosing identities that divide us, making it impossible to tackle multiplying global problems, we can shape identities that extend our sense of compassion and moral responsibility.
The Basic Law supposedly established a political framework to accord with the late Deng Xiaoping’s policy of “one country, two systems,” with Hong Kong’s people ruling Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy.
Of course, Deng’s policy can work only if Beijing wants it to work.
The popular belief is that Tung was sacked or pressured to step down.
In 1984, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said of the impending handover of Hong Kong, “The eyes of the world are on us.”
·        Short-run economic policy should be left in the hands of the central bank, with the legislature and the executive focusing on the long run and keeping their noses out of year-to-year fluctuations in employment and prices;
Moreover, the highest priority for central banks can no longer be to maintain their credibility as guardians of price stability, but rather their credibility as guardians of the financial system’s stability and soundness.
The consensus view is rather that of William McChesney Martin, who served as US Federal Reserve Chairman from 1951 to 1970: a good central bank prevents speculative excess by “taking away the punchbowl before the party really gets going.”
Apart from finding a first job, college graduates seem to adapt more easily than those with only a high school degree as the economy evolves and labor-market needs change. They also tend to vote at higher rates, engage in more civic activities, commit fewer crimes, educate their children better, and get sick less frequently by adopting healthier lifestyles.
But it is also true that 82.5% of these freshmen sought “to learn more about things that interest me” as an important reason for attending college, and 73% wanted “to gain a general education and appreciation of ideas.”
In a nutshell, it has been much easier for the West to do business in the post-colonial Middle East with un-democratic regimes, which have found Western support and recognition useful in marginalizing local liberal and democratic forces, even as it paved the way for the rise of Islamist radicalization.
Decades of unholy alliance between Arab autocrats and the West have seen radical Islam emerge as a “salvation” force.
Obama’s praise of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak as a man with whom one could do business demoralized Egyptian opposition groups, which have been struggling against the long-serving autocrat and his efforts to ensure that his son, Gamal Mubarak, succeeds him.
Add together all the trade-offs between the West and the Arab regimes, along with the Israeli and Islamist factor, and the conclusion at which one arrives is as inescapable as it is alarming: the West cannot afford democracy in the region.
Other American politicians took the same stance.
The target was General Ali Hassan al-Majid, known as “Chemical Ali” because of his use of chemical weapons against Iraqis.
Bush, however, cannot rely on that argument, for it is precisely the kind of justification that he rejects when it comes to destroying embryos in order to save, in the long run, those dying from diseases for which we currently have no cure.
We can be quite sure that American forces would not have acted in the same way if the civilians nearby had been other Americans.
And free mid-day meals at school are a powerful incentive to children from poor families to attend school and stay there.
But, while the country now has 621 universities and 33,500 colleges, only a few are world-class institutions, including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) whose graduates have flourished in America’s Silicon Valley.
I have spoken to many CEOs who tell me that many, if not most, of their new employees require remedial training before they can begin work, in order to compensate for the shortcomings of their university education.
The rest of the E-9, engaged in similar endeavors, will be watching.
This is one of several important messages to emerge from a United Nations Experts Commission on the global economic crisis, which I chair – and which recently submitted its preliminary report to the UN.
But the reform process is slow, and the crisis will not wait.
While one can understand the domestic political imperatives that have led to subsidies and guarantees, developed countries need to recognize the global consequences, and provide compensatory assistance to developing countries.
ऑक्सफ़ोर्ड – लगभग 300 स्वास्थ्य कर्मियों को त्रिनिदाद और टोबैगो भेजने की युगांडा की योजना के बारे में सचमुच असमंजस की स्थिति बनी हुई है। इस योजना में कथित तौर पर युगांडा के 11 पंजीकृत मनोचिकित्सकों में से चार मनोचिकित्सक, 28 रेडियोलॉजिस्टों में से 20 रेडियोलॉजिस्ट, और 92 बाल-रोग विशेषज्ञों में से 15 बाल-रोग विशेषज्ञ शामिल हैं। इसके बदले में, कैरेबियन देश (जिसमें चिकित्सक-रोगी अनुपात युगांडा की तुलना में 12 गुना अधिक है) युगांडा को हाल ही में पता लगाए गए अपने तेल क्षेत्रों का दोहन करने में मदद करेगा।

इसे कारगर बनाने के लिए, प्राप्तकर्ता देश को स्वास्थ्य देखभाल पेशेवरों की भर्ती को पूरी तरह से सरकार के माध्यम से करने के लिए सहमत होना पड़ेगा। फिर वह देश अपने कर्मियों की विदेशी आय पर कर लगा सकेगा और प्राप्त होनेवाले राजस्व का उपयोग अपनी स्वास्थ्य देखभाल प्रणाली को विकसित करने के लिए कर सकेगा।

इबोला इसका एक उत्तम उदाहरण है। 1976 में पहली बार इबोला की पहचान होने के बाद से इस वर्ष से पहले तक, इबोला से 2,000 से कुछ कम लोगों की मृत्यु हुई थी, ये सभी मध्य अफ्रीका में हुई थीं। इस वायरस से 2014 में इससे तीन गुना अधिक लोगों की मृत्यु हुई है, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर इसके प्रसार के मामले काफी अधिक होने के कारण रात्रि समाचार प्रसारणों में और हाल ही में अमेरिका के राज्य और स्थानीय चुनावों में अश्वेत मतदाताओं में इन्हें प्रमुखता मिली।


And the broader impetus behind this Economists’ Declaration, convened by The Rockefeller Foundation and now with more than 300 signatures, has placed global health and development at a historic crossroads.
When people are healthy and financially stable, their economies are stronger and more prosperous.
This can and should be done without forcing the poor to pay for health-care services at the point of delivery.
To achieve a world where everyone’s health needs are met and nobody is trapped in poverty, our leaders must heed this message and act on it.
But, after more than three decades of active research and development, no clinically viable product has obtained regulatory approval, owing to the significant scientific challenges.
Outside of red blood cells, “good” ferrous iron – the only oxygen-carrying form – is oxidized uncontrollably to form the “bad” ferric and “ugly” ferryl forms of hemoglobin.
Some recent therapeutic possibilities include the co-infusion of haptoglobin with hemoglobin in circulation or with vitamin C – additives that hold promising implications for the development of safe and effective blood substitutes.
Yet, despite talk of a rising Asia, only a handful of East Asian economies have moved from low- to high-income status during the past several decades.
The results of the Washington Consensus reforms were at best controversial, and some economists have even described the 1980’s and 1990’s as “lost decades” in many developing countries.
In my view, the shift from understanding the determinants of a country’s economic structure and facilitating its change is tantamount to throwing the baby out with the bath water.
Governments need to provide adequate incentives to encourage first-movers, and should play an active role in providing the required improvements or coordinating private firms’ investments in those areas.
The use of development aid as a political stick merely deepens the suffering of impoverished and unstable countries, without producing the political objectives sought by donors.
But cutting aid is likely to increase turmoil rather than leading to an acceptable long-term compromise between Israel and Palestine.
An aid cutoff to Ethiopia would nonetheless lead to a lot of death among impoverished people, who will lack medicines, improved seeds, and fertilizer.
Is it being stolen? Is it supporting real development needs, such as growing more food, fighting disease, or building transport, energy, and communications infrastructure?
Financial help from abroad is needed to cover roughly $40 per person per year.
For example, the US could give $25 billion in development aid each year and another $25 billion for global health, and still save $50 billion each year to reduce the US budget deficit.
Yet other billionaires have yet to make comparable donations.
The US should divert its wasteful military spending to new health financing.
दाता देशों द्वारा आधिकारिक सहायता के फलस्वरूप चरम गरीबी और बाल मृत्यु दर को आधा करने में मदद मिली है, और इसके कारण कई अन्य मोर्चों पर भी प्रगति के लिए प्रोत्साहन मिला है। लेकिन यह स्पष्ट होता जा रहा है कि विकास सहायता के सतत प्रवाह 2030 तक चरम गरीबी का उन्मूलन करने और संयुक्त राष्ट्र के नए सतत विकास लक्ष्यों को लागू करने के लिए पर्याप्त नहीं होंगे, जिन पर इस वर्ष बाद में सहमति होनी है।
विकास सहायता को सही दिशा में लगाए जाने पर उससे निजी निवेश को जुटाने की भी संभावना होती है बशर्ते इसे जोखिम को कम करने के लिए खर्च किया जाए। विकास सहायता के द्वारा समर्थित गारंटियों, सुलभ ऋणों, और ईक्विटी निवेशों से निवेशकों को आकर्षित करने में मदद मिल सकती है, जैसा कि माली में सौर ऊर्जा परियोजनाओं और इथियोपिया में विनिर्माण संयंत्रों के मामले में हुआ है। 2014 में, यूरोपीय संघ के तत्कालीन विकास आयुक्त एंड्रीस पीबैलग्स ने सूचित किया था कि €2.1 बिलियन ($2.2 बिलियन) के अनुदान की राशि से "2007 से अब तक 226 परियोजनाओं में €40.7 बिलियन का अनुमानित लाभ प्राप्त हुआ" है।
ओईसीडी की विकास सहायता समिति के 29 सदस्य देशों ने दुनिया के सबसे गरीब देशों में सहायता में कमी होने की प्रवृत्तियों को बदलने के लिए प्रतिबद्धता दर्शाई है। इन दाता देशों ने अपनी सकल राष्ट्रीय आय में से कम-से-कम 0.15% राशि को सबसे कम विकसित देशों के लिए विकास सहायता पर खर्च करने के संयुक्त राष्ट्र के लक्ष्य को पूरा करने का भी वादा किया है। इसके अलावा, वे नए नियमों पर सहमत हो गए हैं जिनके अनुसार सबसे गरीब देशों को सुलभ शर्तों पर और अधिक संसाधन प्रदान किए जाने चाहिए, और यह कि ऋण की सततता को सुनिश्चित करने के लिए नए सुरक्षा उपायों को लागू किया जाना चाहिए।
For example, the effects of climate change can pose critical risks to infrastructure – agricultural irrigation, public transportation, or nearly anything else.
But in the past two years, other players have entered the market, and volumes have skyrocketed.
In this context, the recent decision by a coalition of institutional investors to measure and disclose the carbon footprint of at least $500 billion in investments is a step forward.
Sadly, we know that most countries will not meet the objectives by 2015.
The pace of sustainable development is necessarily slow.
As most of today’s financial, environmental, or sanitary crises are unpredictable and ignore borders, it is in everyone’s interest to create a global “social safety net” that will span an indefinite period of time.
In the modern, more productive parts of the economy, productivity (while typically still low) is much closer to what we observe in the advanced countries.
The dualistic nature of developing societies has become more accentuated as a result of globalization.
This difference in patterns of structural change accounts for the bulk of the difference in recent growth rates between Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, on the one hand, and Asia, on the other.
Asian countries, for instance, have typically liberalized at the margin (through export subsidies or special economic zones), spurring new export industries without pulling the rug from under the rest.
MOSCOW – In 2006, when Russia’s government hosted a G-8 meeting on cooperation with emerging development donors, it planted a seed that had great growth potential.
The World Bank wants to learn from these donors, catalyze deeper cooperation, and build a stronger and deeper multilateral system.
Since the full fury of the economic crisis hit in mid-2008, the World Bank has delivered a record $88 billion of assistance for infrastructure, targeted safety nets, and private-sector investment to cushion the most vulnerable and to spur job creation. The Bank created special facilities to assist with food security, rapid crisis response, trade finance, micro-finance, public-private infrastructure, bank capitalization, and restructuring business loans.
The great waves of decolonization were just stirring; the few developing countries were seen as marginal players in the global system – not as central actors or agents of history.
And efforts in the US have implications for other countries as well.
In such cases, the physician must determine how close his or her patient’s situation matches that in the relevant studies. If the disease is not as advanced as in the trials, the doctor will have to decide whether to embark on the recommended protocol.
Moreover, important sources of EBM have themselves proved to be misleading. The Framingham Heart Study, considered the gold standard in its field, was shown to be flawed, owing to its focus on white males.
But the formal classification of diseases has another aspect, one that concerns a variety of important social functions.
Public policy is defined by the public’s interest in the policy, not who made it.
On the other hand, psychiatric public policy must also take into consideration the feeble social and political status of the severely mentally ill.
Classifying disease should reflect the best collaborations between science and politics.
The simple fact is that even if US trade negotiator Susan Schwab had refused to make a single “concession,” and if Europe, Japan, and the big emerging markets had kept their best offers on the table, the US would still remain more open than all but a few small countries.
So, unfortunately, even if Europe came to its senses and emerging markets showed greater enthusiasm for liberal trade, we may not see a big global deal until the next decade.
Absent further trade agreements, there is a big risk that the pace of globalization will slow, with profound consequences for global poverty and welfare.
This year’s campaign was exceptionally peaceful, and millions of citizens voted on December 27 – at times walking and queuing for hours to cast their ballot.
Some tensions are deeply ingrained in societies, and peace requires more than any development agency can deliver.
Ultimately, the enhanced economic activity that development generates is the only way to reduce inequalities, particularly in a context of rapid demographic growth: it is easier to work on a fairer distribution of a growing pie than of a shrinking one.
In Israel, there was harsh criticism of political and military chiefs alike, who were blamed for the loss of 3,000 soldiers in a war that ended without a clear victory.
The war ended with Israeli forces 70 miles from Cairo, and less than 20 miles from Damascus, their success obscured by the shock of the surprise attack, emotional over-reactions, and the difficulty of seeing clearly through the fog of war.
The contingency plan remained on the shelf because of the lack of casualties among Israeli civilians.
Having implicitly accepted responsibility for starting the war, Nasrallah has directed Hezbollah to focus on rapid reconstruction in villages and towns, right up to the Israeli border.
Not according to Daron Acemoglu of MIT (and a co-author of mine on other topics), who presented his findings at the American Finance Association’s annual meeting in early January.  (The slides are on his MIT Web site.)
Acemoglu’s assessment of recent research on lobbying is that parts of the private sector wanted financial rules to be relaxed – and worked hard and spent heavily to get this outcome.
To be sure, the US has long provided subsidies to owner-occupied housing – mostly through the tax deduction for mortgage interest.
The downside was shoved onto the rest of society, particularly the relatively uneducated and underpaid, who now have lost their houses, their jobs, their hopes for their children, or all of the above.
For many years, Japanese governments have taken a “let-sleeping-dogs-lie” approach to territorial disputes over the islands, ignoring repeated provocations by China (and Taiwan).
China appears to have seen the standoff over the Senkaku Islands as a test of wills – a test Kan’s government failed abysmally.
The “rare-earth threat” is not confined to Japan, as China accounts for over 90% of the world’s production, roughly 120,000 tons.
Chinese officials say that concern over the overexploitation and illicit export of rare earths prompted them to regulate the industry more closely.
India is larger, so Rousseff won.
It was precisely that middle class, fed up with allegations of corruption and a sluggish economy, that turned against the ruling Workers’ Party (PT) and voted for change.
Now that the commodity boom is ending, all of these countries face the challenge of building a new economic engine to sustain growth and create jobs.
On the macro side, too little public savings means insufficient savings at the national level.
Rousseff has little time to waste.
Both US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the British Tories’ leader, David Cameron, have spoken recently of a new synthesis of defense, diplomacy, and development, noting that recent American and British foreign policy has placed too much emphasis on the first element at the expense of the latter two.
Neither individuals nor nations have identical interests, however.
If such “global summits” are going to be the principal means of governing in the twenty-first century, we have real cause for concern.
Indeed, diplomats have long been some of the most proficient social networkers and connectors.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be the diplomatic charade that it has been for many years now.
Martti Ahtisaari fully deserved his Nobel Peace Prize for articulating a diplomatic solution to Kosovo’s drive for independence.
“Peace” came about only with the total and unconditional defeat of the Tamil Tiger rebels.
His was a truly revolutionary shift from the politics of saber-rattling to the hard work of establishing regional peace.
With the United Nations sanctions regime now having proven to be utterly ineffective, and with international diplomacy apparently futile in preventing the Iranians from mastering the technology for enriching uranium, Israel is being boxed into a corner.
In October 2007, Vladimir Putin became the first Russian leader since Leonid Brezhnev to visit Iran, bringing along five leaders of the Caspian Sea states.
Any regional security architecture will have to be premised on the Middle East becoming a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.
Dispersing the Terrorist Storm
The institutions and policies established by the European Union are a vivid example of the unobtrusive benefits of modern cross-border integration.
Yet the terrorist blows inflicted on New York, London, and Madrid over the past decade have not shaken Western democracies.
And the focus this year has shifted decisively away from it.
This is exemplified in very different ways by the murderous killing spree in Norway in July, and now by WikiLeaks’ disgraceful release of huge numbers of unredacted diplomatic cables.
IBM’s president, Thomas J. Watson, declared in 1943 that there was “a world market for perhaps five computers.”
The second great disruption is the acceleration of technological change.
Thirty years ago, only a few countries, home to a small share of the global population, had fertility rates substantially below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.
Firms that succumb to such inertia will probably sink, rather than swim, in the new global economy.
Keynes, unlike many of his contemporaries, recognized the forces at work in the economy, adjusted his thinking, and, crucially, was not afraid to be optimistic.
Only central banks – typically lenders of last resort – lean against the hurricane-strength winds.
Historically, the post-crisis consolidation phase has been one in which banks are inclined to be cautious and hesitant.
Now, too, as borrowers find credit increasingly difficult to obtain, and as resentment toward banks – and those responsible for regulating them – grows accordingly, we can expect demands for political intervention to alter the distribution of credit.
They will include prestige projects, high-employment companies, and politically well-connected businesses.
As the drive to divest from fossil fuels picks up speed, such panicky responses are becoming increasingly common.
As Mayor of Seattle, I supported the creation of energy-efficient buildings, the development of solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, and a shift toward walking, biking, and public transit as alternatives to driving – strategies that can help to build a more resilient economy and provide viable alternatives to fossil fuels.
The prudent investor, and the wise business leader, will look where the economy is headed, not where it has been.
Europe’s leaders were also paralyzed – ruling out defaults and devaluations, as well as deficits and stimulus.
The first, preventing a global depression, was achieved. The other two – a growth pact, underpinned by a reformed global financial system – should now be the main items on the G-20’s agenda when it meets.
But, for now, America and Europe cannot expand their consumer spending without increasing exports, while China and the emerging markets cannot easily expand their production or consumption without the guarantee of strong Western markets.
The G-20 will not achieve growth and stability without a renewed focus on long-term debt reduction.
Predictably, going it alone has proven futile in ensuring economic recovery.
Since then, repeated attempts at relaunching the peace process have ended in failure.
Over the last few months, the two leaders have agreed on a package of confidence-building measures, including two new crossing points along the Green Line that divides the island; improved mobile, radio, and electricity connections; and mechanisms for business and cultural cooperation.
The EU’s commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, Christos Stylianides, a Greek Cypriot, staunchly backs reconciliation.
But eventually central banks must pull the plug.  Otherwise they will end up in intensive care themselves as credit losses overwhelm their balance sheets.
It has happened before – for example, during the 1990’s financial crises.
And, while calculating the size of the financial sector is extremely difficult due to its opaqueness and complexity, official US statistics indicate that financial firms accounted for roughly one-third of American corporate profits in 2006.
Central banks have to start fostering consolidation, rather than indiscriminately extending credit.
If economic sanctions are to play an increasingly important role in twenty-first-century statecraft, it might be worth reflecting on how they have worked in the past.
Certainly, severe US sanctions on Cuba failed to bring the Castro regime to heel; indeed, President Barack Obama’s move to reestablish full diplomatic relations may have more effect.
Indeed, significant differences of domestic opinion in the imposing country often undermine sanctions as well.
In a world where nuclear proliferation has rendered global conventional war unthinkable, economic sanctions and sabotage are likely to play a large role in twenty-first-century geopolitics.
It is, of course, true that real long-term interest rates have declined quite markedly – not suddenly and not only recently, but at a fairly steady pace for more than twenty years.
We have to look at the reasons that real interest rates were so much higher 10 or 20 years ago, and think about what that means, and we also have to look at the broader history of asset prices and their relation to real interest rates.
But we do know that in 1984 the best-developed such market (in the United Kingdom) was quoting long-term real interest rates of only around 3% – far below the IMF’s figure.
Derivatives are contracts that derive their value from changes in a market, such as interest rates, foreign-exchange rates, or commodity prices.
If a bank fails, the government stands behind most deposits.
That creates a vicious cycle: the bailout option for too-big-to-fail banks concentrates the derivatives market among a few major institutions, increasing further their systemic importance.
If Citigroup – a poorly managed operation that had to be bailed out in the last crisis – could compel Congress to abandon such a rule, it is reasonable to ask whether the political tides have shifted, and financial regulation will not be tightened further.
But controlling the disease may prove to be a better strategy than striving to cure it. 
In the late 1980’s, biologists found strains that were resistant to all known insecticides.
Recent research suggests that efforts to eliminate cancers may actually hasten the emergence of resistance and tumor recurrence, thus reducing a patient’s chances of survival.
Although resistant forms are commonly found in tumors that haven’t yet been exposed to treatment, they generally occur in small numbers.
Researchers will need to establish the mechanisms by which cancer cells achieve resistance and what it costs them.
Such arguments have limited appeal in the largely secular world of Western philosophy.
One major argument against objectivism in ethics is that people disagree deeply about right and wrong, and this disagreement extends to philosophers who cannot be accused of being ignorant or confused.
He tells us, for example, that what matters most now is that “we rich people give up some of our luxuries, ceasing to overheat the Earth’s atmosphere, and taking care of this planet in other ways, so that it continues to support intelligent life.”

The austerity plans being adopted by governments in much of Europe and elsewhere around the world, and the curtailment of consumption expenditure by individuals as well, threaten to produce a global recession.
Once again, we would see what might appear, from looking at the government deficit, to be an austerity-to-prosperity scenario.
That may seem unlikely – one would think that a bad economic outlook would incline governments to postpone, rather than accelerate, austerity measures.
And the evidence of Guajardo and his co-authors does show that deliberate government decisions to adopt austerity programs have tended to be followed by hard times.
To see this, it is useful to recall how Karl Marx imagined the future.
After all, as the physicist Niels Bohr wryly noted, “Prediction is difficult, especially about the future.”
More surprisingly, the capitalist reorganization of production petered out in the developing world, leaving the vast majority of the labor force outside its control.
In poverty-stricken Bolivia, Francis criticized “the mentality of profit at any price, with no concern for social exclusion or the destruction of nature,” along with “a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system.”
NEW YORK – As Egypt’s revolution hangs in the balance, what factors are most likely to determine the outcome? While all eyes seem to be focused on the army, watching to see which way it will jump, other key questions are being overlooked.
But, in order to choose a leader, these groups must coalesce into a coherent force.
That was a wise decision.
At that point, the constituent assembly and government could decide whether to switch to a presidential form of government or establish a parliamentary system on a permanent basis.
The crisis was always about much more than Greece: a disorderly insolvency there would threaten to pull other economies on the EU’s southern periphery, including some very big ones, into the fiscal abyss, along with major European banks and insurers.
But they need to develop (and fund) an appropriate strategy for economic reconstruction, in order to make clear to the Greeks – and to skittish financial markets – that there is light at the end of the tunnel.
But it makes little sense to insist on it as long as losses by banks that remain “too big to fail” could trigger a renewed financial crisis.
And yes: the rich economies – first and foremost Germany – will have to pay for the way out.
It seems most likely, but no one really knows.
Isolating and further constraining a portion of the banking system, so that the channels of credit intermediation are less prone to complete and simultaneous breakdown, also seems likely.
Responsibility for overseeing the global economy is passing rapidly from the G-7/8 to the G-20, as it should.
Thus, there remains the central question of trust and confidence in the system, which have been badly damaged and will take time to rebuild.
The legalization of prostitution in October 2000 merely codified a long-standing Dutch tradition of tolerance towards buying and selling sex.
Only this year, the city administration has started to close down some brothels because of their ties to criminal organizations.
The success of the Swedish approach is not so surprising.
But, for some men, part of the pleasure of buying sex may be the humiliation conferred on the woman involved.
Sometimes likened to a “secular Pope,” the UN Secretary General can wield the soft power of persuasion but little hard economic or military power.
Another $7 billion supports UN peacekeeping forces in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Lebanon, Haiti, and the Balkans.
Yet in 2006, when Israel and Hezbollah fought to a stalemate in Lebanon, states were only too happy to turn to a UN peacekeeping force.
In East Timor, for example, the UN proved vital in the transition to independence, and it is now working out plans for the governments of Burundi and Sierra Leone.
Counting capital gains, Americans have profited to the tune of $300 billion to $400 billion annually in many recent years – an amount roughly equivalent to the entire US military budget.
Even without any portfolio shift, Americans shouldn’t expect their recent luck to hold up in the future. If there is a global downturn, any region that is long stocks and short bonds is going to get burned.
It took many decades and two world wars before the British pound lost its super-currency status.
An army of pundits tells us that we need to cut emissions, and cut them immediately and drastically.
And this is manifestly not the best of times.
Kyoto-style policies can only ever be an expensive distraction from the real business of weaning us off fossil fuels.
And deeper emissions cuts like those proposed by the European Union – 20% below 1990 levels within 12 years – would reduce global temperatures by only one-sixtieth of one degree Celsius (one-thirtieth of one degree Fahrenheit) by 2100, at a cost of $10 trillion.
It focuses directly on the poor, and on delivering services – for example, education, health care, and microcredit – to their communities.
The dramatic reductions in poverty achieved by China over the span of a few decades, as well as by other East Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan, resulted largely from improved economic management (as much as earlier investments in education and health may have played a role).
Moreover, as with macro-level economic reforms, there are limits to what can be learned from individual projects.
They acknowledge that we do not know what works, and that the binding constraints to development tend to be context-specific.
COPENHAGEN – Policymakers can concoct many excuses not to invest in global aid and development projects.
It makes little sense for the world to impoverish itself by embracing a poor solution to one problem when there are more pressing challenges that can be resolved at smaller expense.
The cost is tiny: reaching 80% of the world’s 140 million or so undernourished children would require a commitment of around $60 million annually, while the economic gains would eventually clear $1 billion a year.
While our bottom-ranked solutions remained more or less the same as four years ago, the top-ranked item in 2004, prevention of HIV/AIDS, was rated lower this time because of subsequent progress. 
7. Lowering the price of schooling
17. Conditional cash transfers to increase the number of children receiving education
27. Diesel vehicle particulate control technology to reduce outdoor air pollution
After all, who could be against an activity that produces uplifting stories like the cell phone ladies of Bangladesh, who lift themselves out of poverty by obtaining loans to buy phones and then selling minutes to others in the village.
That way, they do not have to cut spending substantially in the months before the fee is due, but can instead smooth spending over the year.
Suspicions are further reinforced by politicians’ underlying paternalism – the poor do not know what is good for them and are easily fooled.
The widespread belief among micro-financiers is that the curbs were imposed not because the industry was exploitative, but because it offered an alternative to political patronage.
That dispute ended only when Japan’s economy entered its “lost decades,” which has made the Chinese determined not to repeat the experience.
And for China now, as for Japan then, the undercurrent for these discussions is US frustration with bilateral current-account deficits.
Whereas the peg to the dollar was resumed during the global financial crisis, in June China announced a return to flexibility.
Japan responded by intervening in the opposite direction – dropping interest rates, selling yen, and buying dollars.
Since the beginning of the year, more than 20 central banks around the world have eased monetary policy, following the lead of the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan.
Even China briefly allowed its currency to weaken against the dollar last year, and slowing output growth may tempt the government to let the renminbi weaken even more.
Moreover, verbal intervention will be followed by policy action, because slower growth and low inflation – partly triggered by a strong dollar – will induce the Fed to exit zero policy rates later and more slowly than expected.
That is why America’s entry into the fray was only a matter of time.
A world in which everybody expects a falling dollar is a world in economic crisis.
Thus, the world economy may dodge yet another potential catastrophe.
Unfortunately, mass killings in Africa continue.
And, in the second half of the twentieth century, after a brutal anti-colonial struggle, Africa’s newly independent countries became proxy battlegrounds in the Cold War.
China is the best illustration of this phenomenon.
The problem is that others are abysmally ignorant about the continent’s pre-colonial past.
Faced with the spectacular rise of anti-immigrant populism in France, and now with anti-Zionist demonstrations (which often coincide with an updated version of anti-Semitism), the French Jewish community is anguished and puzzled.
In 2014, by contrast, the French state defends the synagogues and denounces any form of anti-Semitism.
If the images from Gaza seem to resonate so much in France, it is partly a matter of sheer numbers: the largest Muslim community in Europe faces the largest Jewish community in Europe.
Europe’s Anti-Europeans
With her semblance of moderation, she is far more appealing than her father and former party leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen.
But the vicious racist attacks on the justice minister, Christiane Taubira, who is black, would have been unthinkable in past decades.
The Containment Debate, Round Two
Confronting this dual challenge presupposes a combination of long-term, coordinated strategic thinking and pedagogical skill.
If they were, the West would need only to wait for its adversaries to collapse under the weight of their own contradictions: Russia’s overestimation of its means, and, in the case of the Islamic State, the consequences of its appallingly cruel behavior.
Today, Liddell Hart would probably encourage the West to concentrate its efforts on helping the Kurdish fighters in the Middle East and aiding Ukraine’s government in Eastern Europe.
When it comes to politicians’ liaisons, continuity may prevail in France; but on the issue of reform, change may be around the corner.
Public-opinion surveys reveal an interesting dualism: the French want maximum freedom in the private sphere and maximum protection in the public sphere.
But, if he is, it could not have been revealed at a worse moment, precisely when he was intent on steering the country onto a new, courageous, and badly needed course.
The Congress of Vienna Revisited
By contrast, the Treaty of Versailles, too harsh to be honored and too weak to be enforced, paved the way for World War II.
Or perhaps something like the “bipolar hegemony” of Great Britain and Russia after 1815 (though other players like Austria, Prussia, and France mattered) could be reconstituted, with the US and China substituting for Great Britain and Russia.
PARIS – “Day by day, Europe is moving further away from Turkey,” Egemen Bağış, Turkey’s Minister for European Union Affairs, declared last week. But the reverse is equally true: With a mixture of disillusion and defiance, Turkey has been distancing itself from Europe in recent years.
Unfortunately, Turkish elites’ hopes (if not expectations) were not realized. The Arab revolutions ended up exposing Turkey’s own weaknesses and contradictions, further aggravated by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s repressive policies and overweening political style.
Turkey’s current challenge is to overcome lost illusions.
Even the history of the circus is focused on such a pairing: the vain, dignified White Clown and Augustus the Fool, the humble loser who is kicked in the pants by his stiff, pompous partner.
Its incomparable vitality and language, for example, find their way into the work of the Soviet writer Andrei Platonov.
In Washington, accusing fingers point to China, blaming its currency policy for causing large trade imbalances and “destroying jobs” in the United States.
And now, go-it alone fiscal, monetary, and exchange-rate policies are spilling across national borders, threatening currency wars and protectionism.
This had some fatuous implications in the case of China.
Worse still, they have had to adopt strategies – such as currency intervention and accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves – that export financial instability to others.
Don’t Cripple the Tigers
He recently told an Indian audience, “of course, the developing countries will be exempted from any such restrictions, but the developed countries will certainly have to cut down on emissions.”
And Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao recently said, “it’s difficult for China to take quantified emission reduction quotas at the Copenhagen conference, because this country is still at an early stage of development.
In the midst of a financial crisis, it seems unbelievable that European citizens will bear the financial burden of paying off China and India.
Yet, at the same time, the Chinese and Indian challenge could be the impetus we need to change direction, end our obsession with reducing emissions, and focus instead on research and development, which would be smarter and cheaper – and would actually make a difference.
But for most farm products, the phasing out of these subsidies is likely to have only modest effects on world prices – at most a few percentage points.
But should it have become the primary preoccupation of the World Trade Organization?
It provided rich-country governments and then-WTO Director General Mike Moore with an opportunity to gain the moral high ground over anti-globalization protesters.
In the end, it may well be the atmospherics – psychology and expectations – rather than the actual economic results on the ground that will determine the outcomes.
Indeed, China stood with Russia, Belarus, and a few other despotic regimes in prematurely recognizing the thuggish, ballot-stuffing Viktor Yanukovych as President of Ukraine.
Indeed, China has a track record as a serial proliferator, having helped Pakistan build its atomic bomb.
This is why the European Parliament voted across party and national lines in November against lifting the ban until the EU Code of Conduct is made binding.
Something similar is urgently needed now.
First, free-market health care is usually inequitable and inefficient.
For example, each year, 37 million uninsured Indians fall below the poverty line because of catastrophic health expenditures (generally defined as costs exceeding 10% of a household’s total expenditures).
Taiwan initiated a single-payer system in 1995, significantly curbing health-care costs and improving the population’s quality of life.
Which country achieves this goal first will depend not only on revenue, but also on the political will to overcome vested interests.
Money-supply growth has been well above target levels for some time now, indicating excess liquidity.
Judging from the outcome of last month’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council, that “ounce of prevention” appears to be right around the corner for the euro-zone economy.
Politicians – like Jacques Chirac in France, Silvio Berlusconi in Italy, and ECOFIN (the finance ministers of the European Union’s member states) – continue to press for fixed, even lower, interest rates.
The most surprising and controversial thing about last December’s rate hike by the European Central Bank was that, after two and a half years of keeping interest rates at exceptionally low levels, the bank ventured an increase of only 25 basis points with no promise of more to come.
Duisenberg recognized this linkage and held firm.
In an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, for example, Bundesbank president Axel Weber made it clear that future rate hikes were very much on the table.
WASHINGTON, DC – United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s visit to Ukraine on July 4-5 provides an important opportunity to reassure Ukrainians that the US remains committed to Ukraine’s sovereignty and democratic evolution.
In exchange for extending the base agreement, Russia agreed to cut by 30% the price of gas that it sells to Ukraine, throwing out the January 2009 contract signed by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, which ended a 17-day gas crisis.
But there is a critical difference between balancing and subservience.
LJUBLJANA - Throughout history, political leaders have supported existing communication technologies in order to defend the system in which they rule.
Political rulers, too, have never liked new communication technology, because the political system in which they rule is adapted to the existing technology.
In stories about politics, these big actors were political parties.
So it probably would not take much for politicians to be persuaded that the press is essential to democracy, and that its survival – like that of public television in many countries – depends on government support.
Experts are unanimous: the financial, food and energy crisis will hammer the “bottom billion” – the poorest in some 60 countries that survive on around a dollar a day – the hardest.
Foreign companies are pulling back capital, drying import and export financing. Trade is declining.
Africa needs to do its share.
·        there is good governance of natural resources to fuel broader and inclusive development
This will set policy priorities straight, put strategies in place to avert a human catastrophe, and help Africa secure its rightful place at the global economic table.
No region of the world is immune to the impact of CO2 emissions.
This is particularly true in Africa, where some countries, are on an alarming trajectory toward becoming major greenhouse-gas emitters, despite having abundant natural resources that can be developed sustainably and with a minimal carbon footprint.
Africa must make such opportunities easier to find, by consistently implementing good environmental policies; establishing national “green growth” road maps; devising innovative financing vehicles to minimize risk; and lowering transaction costs.
Now Rumsfeld finally realizes the importance of winning hearts and minds, but, as The Economist put it, “a good part of his speech was focused on how with slicker PR America could win the propaganda war.”
A high price was paid for that ignorance.
This does not mean that Rumsfeld’s Pentagon is irrelevant to American soft power. Military force is sometimes treated as synonymous with hard power, but the same resource can sometimes contribute to soft power.
We need hard power to deal with such cases.
Revulsion at government and traditional politicians hit the presidential contest like a tornado in the summer, flattening the campaigns of some who were once seen as serious contenders.
Around mid-August, as Trump’s poll numbers rose even after public statements that would have brought down mere mortal candidates, it dawned on the pundits that he was no summer infatuation.
Moreover, her campaign is struggling to escape the quagmire produced by revelations that she conducted official business on a private email server during her tenure as Obama’s Secretary of State.
But there’s only one Trump, and his candidacy is causing conniptions on the part of Republican Party officials, particularly given his campaign’s open hostility toward Latinos.
Even ardent Republicans have dismissed him as a “rodeo clown,” and his campaign as a “circus.”
But they are not only turning away from mainstream political parties and following populists who promise to clean out the corrupt elites from the centers of power; they also share a taste for political entertainers, or clowns if you like.
Apart from peculiar hairstyles (the balding Berlusconi has his head painted), the new populists have several things in common.
In the past, politicians of the left often came from the trade unions, while conservatives were rich businessmen or landowners.
Trumpism, then, or Grilloism, is a revolt against the professional politicians.
LONDON – As the Ebola virus grips an unprecedentedly wide swath of Africa, many are asking whether it is time to begin administering untested drugs and vaccines.
Similarly, a 2004 New York Academy of Medicine survey indicated that twice as many people were worried about the side effects of the well-established smallpox vaccine as were concerned about the disease itself.
University College London pharmacologist Trevor Smart believes that they may never fully recover.
But this argument largely fell apart with the selection of the 75-year-old Pajares.
One need only recall Seattle’s notorious “God” committee, which in the early 1960s allocated then-scarce kidney dialysis on the basis of criteria like earnings, church involvement, and even Scout membership.
23andMe is also coming under fire from its users.
In providing this information, 23andMe’s customers are building a valuable “biobank” for the company.
The massive corporate data store that Google has accumulated through all of our individual searches has become its most valuable asset.
We believe this same phenomenon can revolutionize health care.”
So when will this promised dollar collapse and crisis come? Bergsten says, "Soon."
Louis Uchitelle of The New York Times quotes the highly intelligent Catherine Mann commenting on the "co-dependent relationship…between the US and its trading partners," which might "last for quite some time," because "the US and its main trading partners have a vested interest in the status quo."
NEW YORK – The global economy, artificially boosted since the recession of 2008-2009 by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus and financial bailouts, is headed towards a sharp slowdown this year as the effect of these measures wanes.
The effects of tax policies that stole demand from the future – such as incentives for buyers of cars and homes – will diminish as programs expire.
The weakening of the euro will help Europe’s external balance, but the benefits will be more than offset by the damage to export and growth prospects in the US, China, and emerging Asia.
A vicious cycle of asset-price correction and weaker growth, together with downside surprises that are not currently priced by markets, could lead to further asset-price declines and even weaker growth – a dynamic that drove the global economy into recession in the first place.
Down with Debt Weight
As a result, the slide was halted, and the rebound was faster than forecasters expected.
However, there is something missing in the story.
With fiscal austerity all the rage, they have given up ensuring that “people can buy” and “industries can produce.”
Junk public bonds are no safer for them than junk private bonds.
These include, as “first among equals,” the UN’s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The modern human-rights movement was born out of the UN, and in many ways it has never entirely left home.
In March, he wrote that “the Organization [must] take the cause of human rights as seriously as those of security and development.”
In a sense, the UN, Annan, and the human-rights activists who have been perhaps his biggest backers, are caught in the crossfire.
Economic growth in the United States has remained anemic, at 1.5-2% for most of the year, and Japan is lapsing into a new recession.
The US Federal Reserve has embraced aggressive, open-ended quantitative easing (QE).
In the US, the fiscal worries are threefold: the risk of a “cliff” in 2013, as tax increases and massive spending cuts kick in automatically if no political agreement is reached; renewed partisan combat over the debt ceiling; and a new fight over medium-term fiscal austerity.
But it is all too easy to forget that the development of this market was initially welcomed, because it enabled even people who would not normally qualify for a mortgage loan to aspire to homeownership.
The dream of homeownership is thus very much alive – and is a powerful economic force – in the emerging world.
On the contrary, a crash makes the dream of ownership more affordable, which benefits first-time buyers – typically the young and less well-off.
In extreme cases, as in Ireland (one hopes not in Spain), the need to save the banking system can bankrupt an entire country.
SEOUL – In mid-November, all eyes will shift to Seoul, when G-20 leaders convene for the first time in the South Korean capital.
The Japanese knew how to coordinate state and private-sector goals in the 1970’s, but then lost their way.
Japanese companies abroad remain profitable and Japan is still the global leader in high-tech niches like electronics or carbon fibers.
When Japan was threatened by Western imperialism, he says, the country had to open up (in 1868) and modernize.
Will this be debated at the G-20? Not openly, but certainly in the corridors.
Well, first and foremost, today’s problems are the result of past success.
But China has re-emerged a big hitter, along with India – whose population will soon be bigger and younger than China’s – and Brazil. How do we cope with this growth of economic and political clout?
And what of the emerging powers? China has taken huge advantage of the global marketplace created above all by the US.
Meanwhile, we drift downstream seemingly oblivious to the looming peril of the rapids ahead.


Though Ebola was known to be both contagious and often fatal, it was thought that only Africa’s impoverished rural population was at risk.
I am not criticizing pharmaceutical companies for not producing an Ebola vaccine when there was no market for it.
One promising attempt to correct this imbalance is the proposal for a Health Impact Fund that Thomas Pogge, director of the Global Justice Program at Yale, and Aidan Hollis, an economist at the University of Calgary, launched seven years ago.
Dry China
To try to compensate for these perturbed weather patterns, Chinese officialdom has launched an unprecedented array of costly projects.
As a result, the Party leadership became steeped in suspicion and distrust toward the outside world, especially toward the so-called “great powers.”
But they remain neuralgic about any hint of outside interference, including even the suggestion that their nation’s business might also be the business of other peoples, and vice versa.
First, farming is geographically concentrated and farmers vote on agricultural policy above everything else, greatly enhancing the power of their votes – something that few, if any, urban consumers do.
Ironically, Japan now offers a seed of hope for agricultural liberalization.
Now the Japanese government, supporting the reformers at the MAFF, is using free-trade deals and negotiations with competitive exporters like Thailand and Australia to pursue agricultural consolidation.
UTRECHT – Gloria Taylor, a Canadian, has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.
Along with Taylor’s right to die, decades of debate about assistance in dying came under scrutiny.
He gave evidence at the trial.
Early Retirement for the Eurozone?
Thus, Germany and the eurozone core have increasingly outsourced official financing of the eurozone’s distressed members to the ECB.
Of course, a breakup now would be very costly, requiring an international debt conference to restructure the periphery’s debts and the core’s claims.
Kita belum pernah menemui tantangan yang sedemikian besarnya atau lebih mendesak dibandingkan dengan kondisi terkini.
Kita perlu mengubah kecenderungan ini.
Sama halnya dengan kita menuntut pemerintah untuk menangani risiko-risiko terkait dengan terorisme atau epidemi, kita pun harus memberikan tekanan besar pada pemerintah supaya bertindak sekarang demi menjaga lingkungan hidup dan mengendalikan perubahan iklim.
·       Kedelapan, guna membantu negara-negara berkembang melawan perubahan iklim, donor harus menyediakan dukungan tambahan pada tingkat yang setidaknya sebanding dengan bantuan pembangunan global yang sekarang.
NEW YORK – On the evening of March 23, 1.3 billion people will go without light at 8:30, and at 9:30, and at 10:30, and for the rest of the night – just like every other night of the year.
Hypothetically, switching off the lights for an hour would cut CO2 emissions from power plants around the world.
In the developed world today, electric stoves and heaters have banished indoor air pollution.
Because of rising energy prices from green subsidies, 800,000 German households can no longer pay their electricity bills.
Earth is Enough
Their numbers show that each American uses 9.4 hectares of the globe, each European 4.7 hectares, and those in low-income countries just one hectare.
How can we do that? How can we actually use more area than there is on earth?
This now makes up more than 50% of the ecological footprint, and will grow to three-quarters before mid-century.
When we really examine the “ecological footprint” calculations, we discover that the only thing the world is running out of is space to plant a colossal amount of imaginary forest that we wouldn’t have planted anyway, to avoid CO2 emissions that we can prevent through much smarter and cheaper means.
And nobody plays the history card with quite as much relish as China, where President Xi Jinping is also relying on nationalism to legitimize his rule.
But Japan and South Korea refuse to let go of history.
Japan responded by blasting China for glorifying a terrorist and propagating a “one-sided” view of history – a move that, Japan asserted, was “not conducive to building peace and stability.”
The Asian Sleepwalkers
Rising powers tend to demand a greater role in international politics, declining powers tend to be reluctant to adjust, and key policymakers are likely to misunderstand the intentions of other countries’ leaders and overreact to their actions.
If the US pursues a predominantly confrontational approach, East Asian politics will inevitably become polarized, just as multipolar nineteenth-century Europe gave way to an increasingly bipolar order in lockstep with rising tensions between Germany and Britain.
So US diplomacy will need to be dexterous.
TOKYO – They don’t look like much, those few uninhabited rocks in the East China Sea between Okinawa and Taiwan, and a couple of tiny islets in the Sea of Japan, inhabited by a few token fishermen and some South Korean Coast Guard officials.
Things became more complicated after World War II.
Since the press in all three countries is almost autistic in its refusal to reflect anything but the “national” point of view, these politics are never properly explained.
He cannot afford to be tainted with collaboration.
The last thing that interests any of them is the truth.
At first, the UN, like many Timorese, including José Ramos-Horta, the country’s Nobel Laureate president who won election last May, had hoped that a national unity government could be formed.
Groups of angry marauding young men armed with stones and slingshots ran amok, setting up roadblocks and torching buildings.
Indeed, the Timorese people have consistently shown that what they want from their government is openness, dialogue, and majority voting under the rule of law.
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán sees no reason to behave otherwise: the refugees are not a European problem, he insists; they are a German problem.
Now Muslim refugees and survivors of other wars, having found no refuge in Eastern Europe, also are fleeing to safety among the Germans.
All occupied European societies were complicit to some degree in the Nazi effort to destroy the Jews.
First Georgia, then Ukraine, and most recently Moldova have all been big EU hopes.
Corruption is rife, state capture by powerful vested interests is the norm, and institutional effectiveness and capacity for reform are weak.
Playing a game of balance between Russia and the West allows the elite to remain in power, and to preserve the oligarchical economy in an otherwise harmful equilibrium of semi-reform.
Or it can work harder to turn balancers into joiners.
But the Belarusian economic model cannot survive, with the trade deficit forecast to exceed $7 billion (14% of GDP) this year.
बड़े शहरों के बाहर, अधिकतर स्वास्थ्य देखभाल सुविधाएँ प्राथमिक स्वास्थ्य देखभाल से ज्यादा कुछ नहीं दे पाती हैं। विश्व बैंक डेटा से यह पता चलता है कि भारत में इस समय प्रति 10,000 व्यक्तियों पर 6.5 डॉक्टर, 13 नर्सें, और नौ अस्पताल बिस्तर उपलब्ध हैं - ये स्तर वैश्विक औसत की तुलना में आधे से भी कम हैं और ये विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन की सिफारिश से बहुत ही कम हैं।

हालाँकि मरियम्मा के रिश्तेदार उसकी बीमारी से बिल्कुल नहीं पसीजे थे, परंतु वे उसकी मौत पर पसीज कर हरकत में आ गए थे। पश्चिम अफ्रीका में इबोला की महामारी के दौरान भी यही चीज़ बहुत बड़े पैमाने पर हुई थी।
लोगों का सामाजिक जीवन भी ठप हो गया था। कई जिलों में कर्फ्यू लगा दिया गया था, और लंबी दूरी की यात्रा को हतोत्साहित किया गया था। कई शहरों में, अपने घर में किसी आगंतुक को स्वीकार करने का मतलब भारी जुर्माने का जोखिम उठाना हो गया था।

BOSTON – Lives are not all that have been lost in the ongoing Ebola crisis.
The public and non-profit sectors should support innovations that are not only focused on solving immediate problems, but that also address potential future challenges.
There is no telling how many lives may depend on the steps we take now.
Moreover, where the private sector does play an essential role – vaccine development – it has little incentive to devote resources to diseases that afflict the poor or poor countries.
Other health metrics are equally disappointing, with data indicating poorer health outcomes for Americans throughout their lives.
Perhaps this, too, is related to higher inequality than in other advanced countries.
And its transmission to two nurses responsible for Duncan’s care – likely resulting from several breaches of medical protocol – has focused intense scrutiny on US preparedness for a possible outbreak. President Barack Obama even announced last week the appointment of an “Ebola Czar” to manage the detection, isolation, and control of the virus in the US.
These reductions have already left their mark.
Though we may not lean too heavily on our health infrastructure typically, its importance becomes all too apparent when disease and death come knocking at our door.
The guiding principle of public health is to prevent disease before it strikes, and this requires long-term investment in institutions that can protect us.
मैंने हाल ही में फ्रांस के राष्ट्रपति फ्रेंकोइस हॉलैंडे के साथ, गिनी की राजधानी कोनाक्री की यात्रा की, और फिर इस देश के वन क्षेत्र के एक ग्रामीण जिले मसेंटा का दौरा किया जो उस स्थान के नजदीक है जहाँ से महामारी शुरू हुई थी। दोनों ही स्थानों पर, मैंने अपनी आँखों से वायरस के विनाशकारी प्रभाव: दुख, भय, निराशा, और, अंतत: मौत को देखा। यहाँ तक कि मामूली लक्षण भी भारी हो गए हैं और इसका परिणाम यह हुआ: किसी ने भी हाथ नहीं मिलाए।


इबोला के प्रसार को रोकने के अतिरिक्त, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समुदाय को मौजूदा संकट के सबक को भविष्य के स्वास्थ्य के संभावित ख़तरों के बारे में शीघ्र, सुदृढ़, और साक्ष्य-आधारित कार्रवाई पर बल देने वाली विश्वसनीय प्रतिक्रिया के विकास पर लागू करना चाहिए। इस लक्ष्य के लिए, तीन महत्वपूर्ण पहल शुरू की जानी चाहिए।
स्वास्थ्य-देखभाल के मज़बूत बुनियादी ढाँचे की स्थापना करने के अतिरिक्त, राष्ट्रीय सरकारों को अपनी आबादी को स्वास्थ्य सेवाएँ प्रदान करने के लिए जवाबदेही वाली प्रणालियाँ विकसित करने की ज़रूरत होगी। इसमें संसाधनों का निष्पक्ष और पारदर्शी नेतृत्व, भ्रष्टाचार-रोधी सुरक्षा उपायों, प्रगति की निगरानी के लिए साधन, सभ्य-समाज की भागीदारी, और विफलताओं के लिए जवाबदेही शामिल हैं।
इन देशों के कमजोर होने का एक महत्वपूर्ण कारण उनकी आबादियों में निवेश का लगातार न होना है, जिसके फलस्वरूप आम नागरिक आर्थिक विकास के लाभों का फायदा नहीं उठा पाए हैं। दरअसल, हालाँकि गिनी, लाइबेरिया, और सिएरा लियोन की अर्थव्यवस्थाओं का इबोला के फैलने से दस साल पहले - क्रमशः 2.8%, 10%, और 8% की औसत वार्षिक दरों पर - तेजी से विकास हुआ था - परंतु उनकी आबादियों को अपने दैनिक जीवन में कोई सुधार दिखाई नहीं दिया। विदेशी प्रत्यक्ष निवेश का 65% से अधिक अंश खनन और वन-कटाई में लगाया गया है जो कम रोजगार पैदा करने और धन को चंद लोगों के हाथ में केंद्रित करने के लिए बदनाम हैं।
संयुक्त राष्ट्र विकास कार्यक्रम सहित, जो संस्थाएँ इबोला के खिलाफ लड़ाई में सबसे आगे हैं, वे समुदायों को इस रोग के खिलाफ एकजुट कर रही हैं, चिकित्सा टीमों का समर्थन कर रही हैं, और जीवित बचे लोगों और संक्रमित लोगों के परिवारों को त्रासदी से निपटने के लिए सहायता प्रदान कर रही हैं। हालाँकि ये प्रयास अधिक महत्वपूर्ण नहीं हो सकते, इन कमजोर देशों के रक्षा तंत्रों को मजबूत करने के लिए उन्हें अधिक दीर्घकालीन रणनीति के द्वारा समर्थित किया जाना चाहिए।
Drawing on the perspectives of roughly 900 experts and decision-makers from around the world who participate in the WEF’s global risks-perception survey, this year’s report found that, for the first time in its ten-year history, economic risks are taking a backseat to environmental and geopolitical concerns.
A rapid and determined response could have done much to contain the virus.
It could even provide a market signal for producers of vaccines and drugs.

बेशक, जब लोगों के स्वास्थ्य की सुरक्षा की बात आती है, तो जनता की रक्षा करने और व्यक्तिगत अधिकारों के अतिक्रमण के बीच महीन अंतर होता है। यही कारण है कि जन-स्वास्थ्य के सभी उपायों को सर्वप्रमुख रूप से वैज्ञानिक तथ्यों पर फ़ोकस करना चाहिए, और भाव���ात्मक या घबराहट की प्रतिक्रियाओं से बचना चाहिए।

After all, clinical research to assess the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and vaccines can happen only during an epidemic.
At the same time, more scientific expertise must be devoted to analyzing the shared data and providing new ideas about prevention and treatment.
Of course, transparent clinical trials and open-data platforms raise legitimate ethical and intellectual-property concerns.
With strong public-health leadership and effective coordination in the fight against infectious disease, people in West Africa – indeed, the entire world – would be able to rest assured that another resurgence of Ebola was not just around the corner.
If, over the past decade or two, affluent countries had done more to assist Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, the current Ebola outbreak could have been minimized, if not prevented.
This can happen when doctors do not know whether a proposed treatment will do more harm than good, or when they are in doubt about which of two treatments is more likely to cure the patient.


On the face of it, the ECB has many reasons to launch QE.
Jens Weidmann, the president of the German Bundesbank, remains openly skeptical.
Unlike in 2012, when the OMT was announced, the objective of QE is not to help governments keep market access.
In fact, the BOJ sets the price.
This is a deeply unfavorable situation, which explains why the ECB, once obsessed with the risk that governments would coalesce to assail its independence, has turned into the staunchest advocate of fiscal-policy coordination.
But major international crises, such as the current global financial crisis, remain with us – which might not be an entirely bad thing.
What remains is the rejection of Eurobonds, but that, too, will ultimately disappear.
The Bundesbank did not fall victim to a sinister southern European conspiracy; rather, it rendered itself irrelevant.
European federalists should welcome this, because the more these heads of state and government turn into a government of the eurozone as a whole, the faster their current dual role as the EU’s executive and legislative branch will become obsolete.
Europeans have reason to be optimistic if they recognize the opportunity that their crisis has created – and act boldly and decisively to seize it.
But what does it mean to “complete” a monetary union? Most important, it means having conditions in place that make countries more stable and prosperous than they would be if they were not members.
Until now, whether or not to carry out such reforms has largely been a national prerogative.
Risk-sharing is thus essential to prevent recessions from leaving permanent scars and reinforcing economic divergence.
But the crisis experience suggests that, in times of extreme market tensions, even a sound initial fiscal position may not offer absolute protection from spillovers.
The EFSI will be equipped with €5 billion in start-up capital, produced through the revaluation of existing EIB assets, and will be backed by €16 billion in guarantees from the European Commission.
The private projects will include the provision of infrastructure, the cost of which is to be repaid through tolls or user fees collected by a private operator.
It is worrisome, to say the least, that the EU is now resorting to similar tricks.
When testifying before the EU Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Luxembourg prime minister and Euro-group chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said there should be “open and frank” talks between the euro-group ministers and the ECB—and French finance minister Dominique de Villepin said the same thing.
Don’t be fooled by such feints. The ECB is holding fast and, in doing so, demonstrates to Europe’s peoples that there is at least one EU institution they can trust.
It was obvious that the lending channels in the banking system had become dysfunctional; excessively restrictive borrowing conditions were suppressing demand.
And, indeed, the ECB’s latest staff projections entail a notable downgrading of the macroeconomic outlook.
But it is important to remember that asset purchases are not an end in themselves.
In particular, increased clarity and transparency about banks’ balance sheets, together with a better-capitalized banking sector, will create a more supportive lending environment.
And ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure, together with his former colleague Jörg Asmussen, currently Germany’s deputy labor minister, recently suggested that Germany should “use its available room for maneuver to promote investments and reduce the tax burden of workers.”
As the historian Robert Kagan argued in 2002, Americans and Europeans do not only have different worldviews; they occupy entirely different worlds.
Of course, resolving a philosophical debate is not impossible.
But central banks’ new role as supreme arbiters of policy truth is fraught with hazard.
The discussion has so far followed easily predictable national patterns: Creditor countries do not object to deflation, because it increases the real value of their investment, whereas debtor countries’ repayment burdens would grow heavier.
QE is a special instrument used when a central bank’s short- and medium-term policy rates are already at zero and it wants to lower long-term interest rates.
Moreover, mortgages are usually securitized.
Though QE might work in a debtor economy with a flexible financial system like the US, it could backfire in a creditor economy with a conservative financial system.
Augmenting the supply of such securities will take time, which is not something European policymakers possess.
Deflationary expectations can be transformed into inflationary expectations – thereby encouraging more spending – only by policies that induce shock and awe.
If the ECB purchases their bonds, governments will be able to ignore market pressure.
Indeed, Europe does stand to reap significant benefits from fiscal consolidation and structural reform – but in the long run, not in the short run, when the problem is deflation.
The theory behind this strategy is simple: Unable to cut the price of credit further, central banks shift their focus to expanding its quantity.
The BOJ has used a similar justification for its own policy of quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE).
Japan has lapsed back into recession, and the BOJ has just cut the inflation target for this year from 1.7% to 1%.
Like lemmings at the cliff’s edge, central banks seem steeped in denial of the risks they face.
First, it erodes the effectiveness of standard monetary policy (because if interest rates went much below zero, depositors would withdraw cash from banks and put it in safes).
Inflation is irrelevant in this respect.
But the ECB’s primary responsibility is to achieve and maintain price stability.
But the ECB’s monetary initiative will also help reignite growth and create jobs, thereby benefiting the poor.
Northern European opposition to Eurobonds reflects moral-hazard concerns that monetary activism will discourage structural reforms.
The ECB is responsible for the eurozone as a whole.
As Krugman recently put it, a “deflationary vortex” is dragging down much of the world economy, with falling prices causing an inescapable downward spiral in demand.
Most notably, they failed to predict the rebound in both the US and the UK, with growth rising and unemployment falling even as deficits were cut.
The panic was sharp and severe, requiring central banks to play their fundamental role as lenders of last resort.
He argued at that time, and rightly in my view, that short-term tax reductions and transfers would be partly saved, not spent, and that public debt would multiply and create a long-term shadow over the fiscal balance and the economy.
RENNES – Michael Russell and Murray Jarvik, two pioneers of smoking-cessation research in the 1970s, would probably have welcomed the development of the electronic cigarette or “personal nicotine vaporizer” (PNV).
In fact, nicotine has been the primary target of anti-tobacco campaigns for more than three decades.
But, even on this front, the devices have had considerable success, with PNV use increasing exponentially in the last few years.
In January, a group of scientists (including me) sent a letter to the European Commission imploring it to implement evidence-based, proportionate regulation that allows users of PNVs to identify the product and dosage that suits them.
International organizations and non-governmental agencies such as the UNHCR and the International Rescue Committee, and religious leaders such as Pope Francis and the Archbishop of Canterbury, have weighed in as well. But one group’s voice has been conspicuous by its absence: business.
Becoming involved early in the process of assessment, education, and integration planning would allow the private sector to help shape policy from the outset, rather than complaining about the government’s failures after the fact.
But Europe’s refugee crisis is also a business problem. By addressing it now, business can turn that problem into an opportunity for all.
Dalam lima tahun ke depan, ketiga negara ini akan diikuti oleh Bulgaria, Finlandia, Yunani dan Portugal.
Tetapi jika perkiraan ini terbukti benar, beberapa negara akan mengalami transformasi yang serupa bahkan dalam waktu satu dekade lebih cepat.
Negara-negara seperti Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Republik Afrika Tengah dan Zimbabwe memiliki angka harapan hidup terendah di dunia.
The dismal failure of Middle Eastern and North African economies to deliver the prosperity that their people desperately want is a constant factor pushing people into the streets.
Without high-speed Internet, foreign investment and indigenous entrepreneurship are almost impossible.
Bernard Avishai, a distinguished Israeli professor of business and government who divides his time between Israel and the US, notes that whatever Israel’s young people may think of the Palestinians, they “expect to fly off from Ben-Gurion Airport and land, accepted, in the Western world.”
PRINCETON – Everyone now knows that we are in the worst economic crisis since the 1930’s.
Suddenly, in the face of the economic crisis, these problems have become major sources of political instability.
So only the EU’s strongest countries can really do anything against the sharply worsening recession.
The most obvious way is to use existing mechanisms and institutions, in particular the ECB or the European Commission.
One of the most pervasive and apparently self-evident assumptions of development economics is that sustainable investment and growth requires the rule of law.
In these societies, the social order is predominantly shaped by informal agreements rather than formal laws and regulations.
In these cases, women are often the victims.
For example, trying to eliminate corruption in environments with strong patronage-based power and redistribution mechanisms while failing to address the root problems can do more harm than good, and might lead to violent conflicts over new resources.
कैंब्रिज - आर्थिक विकास ने पिछली आधी सदी में करोड़ों लोगों को ग़रीबी से बाहर निकाला है तथा और बहुत-से लोगों के जीवन में सुधार लाया है। फिर भी यह अधिकाधिक स्पष्ट होता जा रहा है कि मात्र आर्थिक प्रगति के आधार पर मानव विकास का मॉडल अधूरा है। ऐसा समाज सफल नहीं हो सकता जो बुनियादी मानवीय ज़रूरतों पर कार्रवाई करने, लोगों को अपने जीवन की गुणवत्ता में सुधार लाने में सक्षम बनाने, पर्यावरण की रक्षा करने, और अपने अनेक नागरिकों को अवसर प्रदान करने में विफल रहता है। समावेशी विकास के लिए आर्थिक और सामाजिक प्रगति दोनों की ज़रूरत होती है।


In parts of the world where the rule of law is weak, criminal networks and corruption displace democratic processes.
The pursuit of individual attainment is the hallmark of our time, eclipsing the collective dimension of human destiny.
These movements’ amorphous nature – often channeled through charismatic leaders – allows each individual to project onto them his or her dreams, making them difficult to counter within the framework of traditional politics.
Politics begins where contemporary economics ends – with ethics and the attempt to create a justly ordered society.
This divergence is as much a political phenomenon as it is an economic and financial one.
Too many political leaders around the world remain unable – or unwilling – to fulfill their economic-governance responsibilities.
As policy inertia prolongs sluggish growth and impairs job creation, it becomes even more difficult to abandon.
LONDON – The king of Bhutan wants to make us all happier. Governments, he says, should aim to maximize their people’s Gross National Happiness rather than their Gross National Product.
Curiously, the one taboo area in this discussion is population.
More recent metrics have tried to incorporate a wider range of “quality of life” indicators.
More equality would not only produce the contentment that flows from more security and better health, but also the satisfaction that flows from having more leisure, more time with family and friends, more respect from one's fellows, and more lifestyle choices.
That lesson has been lost on most economists today, but not on the king of Bhutan – or on the many people who have come to recognize the limits of quantifiable wealth.
But when its score is adjusted for inequality, it drops 23 spots – among the largest such declines for any highly developed country.
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (or “Obamacare”) was intended to ameliorate these threats – and there are strong indications that it is on its way to significantly reducing the number of uninsured Americans.
These insecurities are in addition to those that have long confronted Americans.
And policies, like austerity, that increase insecurity and lead to lower incomes and standards of living for large proportions of the population are, in a fundamental sense, flawed policies.
Dwelling on performance anxiety may cause hesitation or a loss of inspiration.
In fact, real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are hovering around zero throughout much of the world, and have been for more than five years.
People’s weak appetite for economic risk may not be the result of pure fear, at least not in the sense of an anxiety like stage fright.
Likewise, much of the rapid advance in communications in recent years reflects innovations – smartphone and tablet hardware and software, for example – that has been indigenous to the US.
BEIJING – Throughout the just concluded 18th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party ubiquitous television screens in trains and metro stations broadcast a live feed of the Chinese assembly.
But the authorities remain cautious, given that China’s economic outlook depends heavily on external conditions, which is the source of most current uncertainty.
As some Chinese colleagues told me, the success of reforms in the next decade will depend more than ever on good design.
As the economic pie grows less rapidly, greater fairness will be crucial to social stability.
But the report’s fundamental legacy remains: we have inherited a tendency to obsess over misguided remedies for largely trivial problems, while often ignoring big problems and sensible remedies.
Technological innovations have replaced mercury in batteries, dental fillings, and thermometers: mercury consumption is down 98% and, by 2000, the price was down 90%.
Whereas the Club of Rome imagined an idyllic past with no particulate air pollution and happy farmers, and a future strangled by belching smokestacks, reality is entirely the reverse.
Indeed, reliance solely on organic farming – a movement inspired by the pesticide fear – would cost more than $100 billion annually in the US.
An expansion of trade, with estimated benefits exceeding $100 trillion annually toward the end of the century, would do thousands of times more good than timid feel-good policies that result from fear-mongering.
Hirschman’s interests shifted away from economic development over the course of his illustrious career.
They need to identify priorities and opportunities, and work on them.
What matters at any point in time is to alleviate a society’s immediate binding constraints – another reason why different policies are needed for different places.
This line of thinking has vast implications for the design of appropriate global economic arrangements.
Half-a-Loaf Growth
Economic growth surged ahead, and returns on public investment soared, reaching an annual growth rate above 9% of GDP, shortly after the reforms were implemented.
Nor is the difference greater political effectiveness; few would say that the US government is functioning well nowadays, given rising partisanship and sharp disagreement about its proper role.
Moreover, in order to ensure that such reforms ultimately benefit everyone, there must be a strong culture of trust and a determination to prevent more flexible arrangements from leading to abuses.
Given the risk inherent in betting on policy convergence, labor mobility – which enables highly valuable human capital, especially well-educated young people, to leave lagging regions for those that offer more and better employment opportunities – could prove to be a critical tool for adjustment.
The unprecedented growth of per capita income during the last 20 years has lifted more than one billion people out of extreme poverty.
Nonetheless this rate of long-term growth would constitute a sharp break with the six-fold GDP expansion and nearly three-fold increase in per capita income of the last 50 years.
They earn about three-quarters as much as men in the same occupations, and are over-represented in informal, temporary, and low-productivity jobs.
Even if gains in female labor-force participation and resource-efficient productivity growth sustain high rates of economic growth, one key challenge remains: income inequality.
In a recent critique of what he calls the “mathiness” of modern economics, Paul M. Romer of New York University argues that economists should take measures to exclude academic factionalism and politics from the dismal science.
In addition to criticizing those that draw general conclusions from specific cases, Romer takes aim at those who claim that economic models permit only one mode of interaction and only one mode of individual decision-making.
After all, that is what a model with a very restricted class of rational expectations would predict.
The multi-speed global economy will be dominated by four groups of countries.
The final group comprises the “wild card” countries, whose size and connectivity have important systemic implications.
By contrast, the European Central Bank will pursue its own version of quantitative easing, introducing in the first quarter of the year a set of new measures to expand its balance sheet.
Avoiding the disruptive potential of divergence is not a question of policy design; there is already broad, albeit not universal, agreement among economists about the measures that are needed at the national, regional, and global levels.
Economic advisers assured their bosses that recovery would be rapid.
It is now pretty much agreed that fiscal tightening has cost developed economies 5-10 percentage points of GDP growth since 2010.
And here was the clincher: By committing themselves to fiscal tightening, finance ministers gave themselves scope for some fiscal loosening.
The right policy’s success may depend on the public’s expectations of its effects.
Governments, it is true, could get their money cheaper as yields fell.
But Keynesians have to face the uncomfortable truth that the success of stabilization policies may depend on the business community having Keynesian expectations.
At this point, policy becomes expansionary again, and the cycle begins anew: led by investment growth, the economy rebounds.
According to preliminary reports, annual investment growth in 2012 reached roughly 14% – significantly higher than the GDP growth rate, which accelerated in the fourth quarter as a result of a strong rebound in investment in real estate and infrastructure.
If the government’s contingent liabilities are included, China’s debt/GDP ratio may be closer to 50%.
For now, the Chinese economy, having received its cyclical dose of stimulus, should be okay.
First, countries did not view their sovereign debt as a binding constraint, and instead pursued investment and potential growth.
Recent IMF research suggests that, given excess capacity, governments would probably benefit from substantial short-run multipliers.
And, though unconventional measures have reduced financial instability, their effectiveness in countering widespread deflationary pressures or restoring growth remains dubious.
This is especially evident in Europe, where it is argued, with some justification, that, without such reforms, growth will remain anemic, sustaining or even exacerbating fiscal constraints.
The list of potential policy actions that could benefit the United States – trade liberalization, comprehensive regulatory reform, and immigration and education reform, among others – is long.
But the concerns of serious people, whether on the left or the right, are not so different.
Corporate-tax reform also offers a good opportunity for bipartisan agreement, especially given that Obama and congressional leaders of both parties have expressed interest.
For example, future growth in Social Security benefits or the home-mortgage-interest tax deduction could be scaled back for more affluent individuals, as progressive indexation, proposed by conservatives in the US, and the adjustment of mortgage-interest tax deductions in the United Kingdom, started during the Thatcher administration, attest.
But in a world of low inflation and zero nominal interest rates, getting to the required negative real rate may be a challenge.
This assessment bothers optimists like Joel Mokyr or Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, who do not believe that technological progress has slowed.
Broadcast radio and television were the first to confront this problem, because they could not prevent those with a receiver from getting the signal.
But the Center for Economic Policy Research, which published the e-book, and Project Syndicate, which distributes this column, are both (at least to some extent) donor-funded.
But I think that much of economics has been discredited by the manifest failure of many economists to be as smart as McCulloch’s parrots were.
Or consider the claims – also rampant these days – that further government attempts to increase demand, whether through monetary policy to alleviate a liquidity squeeze, banking policy to increase risk tolerance, or fiscal policy to provide a much-needed savings vehicle, will similarly fail.
They will agree with the parrots that falling inflation showed that the macroeconomic problem was insufficient demand for currently produced goods and services, and that the low level of interest rates on safe, high-quality government liabilities showed that the supply of safe assets – whether money provided by the central bank, guarantees provided by banking policy, or government debt provided through deficit spending – was too low.
Asked to name where to turn to understand what was going on in 2008, Summers cited three dead men, a book written 33 years ago, and another written the century before last.
But what astonishes me even more is the apparent failure of academic economics to take steps to prepare itself for the future.
Perhaps academic economics departments will lose mindshare and influence to others – from business schools and public-policy programs to political science, psychology, and sociology departments.
Robert May, an eminent climate change expert, has argued that techniques from his discipline may help explain financial-market developments.
Many conference participants agreed that the study of economics should be set in a broader political context, with greater emphasis on the role of institutions.
Indeed, according to King, “Young economists arrive in the financial world with little or no knowledge of how the financial system operates.”
This amounts to what we might call an “irrelevance” defense: Finance theorists cannot be held responsible, since no one in the real world pays attention to them!
MUNICH – There is much to criticize in economics nowadays.
Markets are generally efficient if companies’ revenues correctly reflect all the benefits that their output bestows on third parties, while their costs reflect all the harms.
Trying Keynesian therapy to resolve, say, the structural problems currently affecting the countries of southern Europe would be like trying to cure a broken leg with heart medicine.
Competition, contrary to what many on the right believe, is not always good.
Banks that grant risky loans on too little equity illustrate the analytical value of homo economicus particularly clearly.
A technological leap that raises the wages of the skilled and educated will induce others to become skilled and educated, restoring balance so that inequality does not grow too much.
Today, if we divided up equally what we produce worldwide, would it give us a standard of living ten times that of our pre-industrial ancestors? Twenty times?
Not in Marshall. And why is today’s world so unequal that it is hard to find any measures of global distribution that do not show divergence at least up until the 1980’s?
Clearly, economics – if it is to succeed and progress – must be very different in a generation from what it is today.
Remove constraints on what politicians can do, he implied, and all you will get are silly interventions that throttle markets and stall the engine of economic growth.
Well-functioning markets are always embedded within broader mechanisms of collective governance.
True, the quality of democratic governance can sometimes be augmented by reducing the discretion of elected representatives.
For instance, we know that the global capital-adequacy requirements produced by the Basel Committee reflect overwhelmingly the influence of large banks.
Ultimately, the question concerns whom we empower to make the rules that markets require.
Paul Romer, one of the originators of new growth theory, has accused some leading names, including the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas, of what he calls “mathiness” – using math to obfuscate rather than clarify.
So, unlike the natural sciences, economics advances scientifically not by replacing old models with better ones, but by expanding its library of models, with each shedding light on a different social contingency.
A map of a province was so detailed that it was the size of an entire city.
Practitioners use a variety of formal and informal empirical methods with varying skill.
We say that Mary died in a car accident, not that she was a casualty of the Road Traffic Act.
Full anonymity explains why efficiency rules – say, leaving the most “expensive” patients untreated when resources are scarce – meet with no protest.
Dying is hard. But it is our fate as humans, and it is usually accepted with dignity when the hour comes.
The higher the technical capabilities, and the costs, of modern medicine become, the more contested this particular value judgment will be.
Japan needed real financial risk sharing: charity rarely amounts to much.
Of course, compared to Japan’s two “lost decades” since 1990, even this year’s triple disaster pales in significance.
Investors around the world would take on Japanese GDP risk in return for an expected yield, just as with catastrophe bonds.
An Even More Dismal Science
Krugman made the case that central banks had already succeeded in anchoring inflation expectations to low levels, but had nonetheless failed to put the economy back on track.
Disagreement among economists nowadays reflects different positions not so much on the state of the economy, but on whether macroeconomic policy can provide an effective cure.
Teaching Economic Dynamism
But, again, this contradicts traditional trade dynamics, in which one country’s success does not imply hardship for another.
In these economies, innovation was powered not by global scientific progress, but by the population’s dynamism – their desire, capacity, and latitude to create – and willingness to allow the financial sector to steer them away from unpromising pursuits.
Specifically, students must be exposed to – and learn to appreciate – the modern values associated with individualism, which emerged toward the end of the Renaissance and continued to gain traction through the early twentieth century.
But, just over the horizon, there looms another social catastrophe that they have yet to acknowledge.
The McKinsey Global Institute has identified 12 potentially disruptive innovations – including 3-D printing, advanced robotics, and autonomous vehicles – that will revolutionize the business landscape, creating new opportunities for young minds, while driving older workers from the job market.
Likewise, European countries’ massive public debt is limiting policymakers’ ability to protect vulnerable sectors.
In order to ensure life-long learning programs for all workers, without putting excessive strain on public budgets, they should promote public-private partnerships.
A majority of public opinion polls taken in the last four years show that the views of Americans about Islam continue to be a casualty of the attacks of September 11, 2001.
A companion policy conference has attracted scholars and artists from around the world exploring the relationship between cultural practice and public policy and suggesting new directions for cultural diplomacy.
The US must focus once again on the arts as a meaningful way to promote stronger cultural engagement and, ultimately, to find new channels of communication with the Muslim world.
Some values, long espoused by the Union, should be relatively easy to convey.
A thirst for knowledge, a delight in engaging with the world, and empathy with people from different cultures are qualities that can ensure diversity in unity, and unity in diversity.
To acquire an insight into how people from other cultures perceive the world, what is required is knowledge of how they live and experience life.
Liberal democracy, in its search for civic-mindedness, depends on people and institutions that can guide the way by their example, beliefs, or worldview.
It is sheer desperation that is forcing them to embark on life-threatening voyages.
Only 2% of humanitarian aid currently goes to schools, and aid agencies struggle to cope with emergencies.
The sums are not large relative to the scale of the problem. For just over $500 a year, or $10 per child per week, we can provide school places that would allow parents and children to do what they would prefer to do – be educated in the region.
Yet rich countries also fail.
The US now imprisons around 2.3 million people at any time, a substantial number of whom are poor people who are arrested for selling drugs to support their own addiction.
To break the cycle of poverty, a country needs to invest in its children’s future, not in the imprisonment of 2.3 million people a year, many for non-violent crimes that are symptoms of poverty.
A poor child in Sweden has benefits from the start.
Children born poor are likely to remain poor; children born into affluence are likely to be affluent adults.
We also know that better educated people tend to earn more.
And yet, in terms of economic growth, China blew all of them out of the water.
Whatever is preventing these countries from becoming richer, it is not lack of education.
ADDIS ABABA – In 2000, when the world adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a promise was made: education is a right, and every child must be educated.
Today, we need to unlock the same doors to ensure that governments, philanthropists, the private sector, and others step up to meet the world’s education needs.
As world leaders head to Addis Ababa this week for the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, they will be guided not only by what happened in Oslo, but also by other important recent markers of global sentiment.
Much can be done to create global goods platforms for educational inputs like books, technology, professional support materials for teachers, and student learning assessment mechanisms.
Even though she is now fluent, her goal of attending school remains elusive; she has no money with which to pay the necessary fees. All she wants, she says, is to train to be a teacher – “to help remove the sadness from children’s hearts.”
Education Minister Elias Bou Saab has cut through red tape and sectarian disputes to introduce a double-shift system in the country’s schools, beginning in September. In the morning, Lebanese children will be educated in French and English.
Education in an Uncertain World
Much work remains to be done – even in high-income countries.
In the past, education was about imparting knowledge.
But as technology progresses and once separate economies become interdependent, working with others is becoming increasingly important.
Employers will have to invest in their workforces.
China soon surpassed the US in other important measures.
Indeed, despite territorial disputes and other divisive issues, the commissioners of the patent offices of Japan, South Korea, China, and, to a lesser extent, Singapore and Taiwan meet often to define and coordinate their intellectual-property (IP) policies.
And Chinese and Western companies should be encouraged to invest in one another’s IP.
Instead of shaking its fist, the West could provide incentives that encourage China to become a responsible actor in the existing IP regime.
The West should pay attention to these efforts, because they could offer alternatives to traditional avenues for sourcing and financing invention, such as venture capital, that are producing lackluster results.
On October 16, 1973, ten days after Egypt’s army surprised the Israelis by crossing the Suez Canal, Sharon turned defeat into victory by leading his own troops across the canal through a narrow gap in the Egyptian front.
That is exactly what happened.
The main assault force advanced toward the target in the darkness until detected, then rushed forward, firing every weapon, while mortar and machine-gun emplacements remained in the rear, firing just ahead of the advancing troops.
But paratroopers, flown in by helicopters, suddenly jumped the Egyptian gun crews, who never had a chance in hand-to-hand combat.
There could be no repeat of the Great Depression, not only because monetary policy was much better (it was), but also because international cooperation was better institutionalized.
But every major international crisis since then has chipped away at its authority. The 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis undermined its legitimacy in Asia, as many governments in the region believed that the crisis was being exploited by the United States and US financial institutions.
The G-20, by contrast, brought in the big emerging markets, and its initial promise was to provide a way to control and direct the IMF.
And, with the espionage apparently directed mostly at representatives of emerging economies, the gulf between the advanced countries and those on the rise has widened further.
MADRID – The continued leaking of classified information by the former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has provoked heated debate about privacy and international law, which, unfortunately, has overshadowed the geostrategic dimension of his actions.
Following the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011, which the Kremlin regarded as another example of Western overreach, Russia has been more aggressive in asserting itself internationally, mainly in opposition to the US.
Unfortunately, the chickens of Obama’s first term have already come home to roost.
By dismissing European concerns about how such surveillance is carried out, Obama has demonstrated one of America’s worst habits – that of patronizing Europe.
No one should deny that what happened in Egypt was a military coup, or that forces from former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime have returned to power.
We should not forget that Morsi’s opponent in the presidential election in 2012 was Ahmed Shafik, a former general and the last Mubarak-era prime minister – certainly no liberal.
Underlying the contradiction between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood is not only the question of religion, but also all of the social problems, including inequality, that riddle Arab societies.
More broadly, with Syria’s civil war destabilizing Lebanon and threatening to do the same in Jordan, and with Iraq plagued by similar sectarian violence, the military coup in Egypt appears to herald the end of the Arab revolutions, at least for the time being.
It is the type of battle between Caesar and God that took Europe centuries to resolve.
Indeed, Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s deposed president, has only himself to blame for his political demise.
The Islamist Ennahda party leads the government, but it faces a serious challenge from the ultra-conservative Salafists of Hizb Ut-Tahrir.
The Rebirth of Egypt
With unemployment running at 30-40%, the government faces a disenfranchised and increasingly bitter population.
But, because the relevant changes are not captured or adequately reflected in national-accounts data, perceptions are at odds with the activity that is unfolding beneath the macroeconomic level.
The reality, however, is that the country is marching, slowly but surely, away from the omnipresent and omnipotent state that has dominated Egyptian economic life for many decades.

His challenger, former President Hosni Mubarak’s last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq, had no chance of winning a clean vote, despite the support of a huge state-controlled propaganda machine and various tycoons.
Now the hard part begins for Morsi, who confronts an intense power struggle between the beneficiaries of Mubarak’s status quo – generals, business tycoons, National Democratic Party bosses, senior judges, media personnel, and senior state employees – and pro-change forces, whose largest organized entity is the Brotherhood.
After the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) won parliamentary elections and formed a government in October of that year, the right-wing military establishment accepted the new democratic rules of the game and foiled a coup attempt that sought to block the advance of the left.
Egypt’s Dead Men Walking
Overall, civilian courts have handed down more than 1,000 death sentences since Egypt’s military overthrew Morsi in July 2013.
The “hawks” who control the security and military establishments seem intent on restoring a Mubarak-style regime, but with one key difference: they believe that Mubarak did too little to repress the opposition.
The organization has also adopted a harsher line, having publicly stated that the “reformist” approach that its government took after winning parliamentary and presidential elections in 2011 and 2012 was “wrong”, and that excluding non-Islamist revolutionary youth groups was a “major mistake.”
Mubarak's ill health, widely rumored for years, was never officially acknowledged until November 2003, when it could no longer be covered up.
Mubarak has been re-elected four times, and rumors have persisted that he will either seek a fifth six-year term or establish a "hereditary republic" and groom his 41-year old son, Gamal, to succeed him, like Syria's Hafez al-Assad and son, Bashar.
There are no checks and balances on these powers.
It is no less important to reduce the presidency's sweeping powers and formulate viable mechanisms for enforcing the accountability of all public officials without exception.
People to whom I spoke in Jordan’s government and palace say that they were led to believe that the post would go to Mubarak’s last prime minister, Ahmed Shafiq.
With the announcement of Morsi’s victory in Egypt, spring seems to have returned to Jordan more quickly than even Khasawneh had expected.
And better relations with Egypt presuppose closer ties with Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood.
His successor, Ehud Olmert, began negotiating a final-status agreement with the Palestinian Authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas.
Major Israeli cities were hit several times.
Its hegemony is challenged by the more radical Islamic Jihad (which remains allied with Iran) and a host of Salafi and jihadi groups, some connected to radical elements in Sinai, which complicates Hamas’s relations with Egypt.
Israel’s assault scored impressive initial successes, while Hamas can take pride in having reached Tel Aviv with its missiles, an achievement that eluded Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War.
If the US and Europe choose to remain inactive, they must at least encourage Egypt to play its role.
A spontaneous cry was heard from the lawyers and the families of victims when they were announced: “The people want to cleanse the judiciary.”
Unlawful detentions, kidnappings, disappearances, systematic torture, rape, and inhuman prison conditions have all been documented since the 1980’s by human-rights organizations and a few Egyptian courts.
“He was advocating dialogue with protesters, whereas al-Adly’s men wanted a harsh crackdown. They got their way in the end,” says Major Ahmad Ragab, the spokesperson of the reformist General Coalition of Police Officers (GCPO), which seeks to establish an official police syndicate and reform the security services along apolitical, professional lines.
The majority of these voters will probably now support Morsi, as opposed to staying home (the general drift before the verdicts).
Five ministries – information, higher education, youth, labor, and housing – were given to the Muslim Brothers’ Freedom and Justice Party (FJP).
But others, like the members of the more revolutionary Officers but Honorable Coalition, accuse Gamal al-Din of being a member of a powerful anti-reform faction in the ministry, dubbed “al-Adly’s men” (after former Interior Minister Habib al-Adly).
Hatem Saleh, the deputy chairman of the Civilization Party, which joined the Muslim Brotherhood’s electoral coalition in the last parliamentary election, was named Minister of Industry and Foreign Trade.
The struggle for Egypt thus continues.
As the day ended, Morsi’s office declared that it had not been consulted prior to the army’s statement, and tens of thousands of the president’s supporters demonstrated in several cities simultaneously at midnight.
On the economic front, the Egyptian Central Bank’s report for the period of July 2012 to March 2013 indicates that the balance-of-payments deficit fell from $11.2 billion to $2.1 billion, owing to rising tourism revenues and debt forgiveness.
Indeed, the revolutionary step of steering once-armed Islamists toward electoral and constitutional politics could be reversed in ongoing power struggle.
Moreover, a possible replacement for Morsi is not very clear.
It took decades to develop techniques to classify and derive new solutions.
Finding a description of gravity that is compatible with our understanding of quantum physics would revolutionize cosmology, yield new insights into the first moments of our universe, and provide a deeper understanding of the theories on which all of modern physics is based.
Rather than seeking to detect a quantum of the gravitational field, researchers are looking for other effects that would imply that gravity is quantized.
None of these advances would have been possible had researchers been operating according to the three-year plans that characterize much of current academia.
First, a POC test must meet the particular environmental and operating constraints of where it will be used.
For example, a new class of device, about the size of a postage stamp, that splits a sample into multiple zones with different detection chemistries has been used to test multiple conditions associated with liver failure in HIV and tuberculosis patients.
Finally, the successful deployment of non-dedicated phone-based testing would require acceptance from the medical establishment.
They must be embedded in a much more complex institutional framework, which I would describe as the liberal order.
This is where the second pillar of a liberal order comes into play: the rule of law.
This is where the third element of a liberal order comes into play: civil society.
The shoot-out’s individual competition for heroism or misery is really alien to such a team game as football, but it is accepted as a necessary way to resolve the stalemate. But when it comes to elections – which ideally should always produce a winner – there is no such device.
On the contrary, electorates everywhere seem more volatile than anything else, with voters prepared to change their preferences from one poll to the next.
One may doubt whether this will increase popular confidence in the political class, but for now, at least, the arrangement is working.
There is currently no such risk in Europe.
There are enough good options available to suggest that the world can accomplish the goal of controlling climate change at a reasonable cost (perhaps 1% of global income per year) while enabling the world economy to continue to grow and raise living standards.
While the Prius is a normal ICE automobile with a small motor, the Volt will be an electric vehicle with an engine alongside.
Not only will battery-powered vehicles draw power from the electricity grid during recharging, but, when parked, they can also feed additional power back into the grid during periods of peak demand.
Our climate negotiators today bicker with each other because they view the climate challenge only in negative terms: who will pay to reduce fossil-fuel use?
This outcry should mark the start of a global movement to lift the veil of silence that shrouds violence against women – which often begins at home – and protects the perpetrators.
This potential was evident during the Arab Spring uprisings, when women, empowered by recent advances in literacy and education, organized and led demonstrations that toppled decades-old regimes. In Egypt, even as female political activists and reporters were being sexually harassed in Tahrir Square, they continued to contribute to the revolution.
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ratify and enforce all relevant regional and international treaties, and implement laws that prohibit violence against women and ensure effective punishment of offenses.&#160;
The problems that brought us the terrible crisis of 2007-08 have not been fixed.
Warren has worked hard on financial-sector issues over many years.
After the video of Warren’s statement went viral, more than 13,000 people signed a petition demanding real accountability.
Sensible officials resist this, but they need political cover – elected representatives who will support them on Capitol Hill.
The scientific revolution was made possible by the printing press, the industrial revolution by the steam engine, and India’s escape from famine by increased farm yields – the so-called “Green Revolution.”
So the challenges of survival are enormous.
In future years, China and India also will make massive contributions to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
On a recent visit to Africa, a senior agricultural scientist said that in today’s world, the scientist is closer than ever before to the farmer, but farther away than ever from the policymakers.
As a co-founder of Doctors Without Borders, he stated that “we were establishing the moral right to interfere inside someone else’s country.”
It invites us to see a big part of the Islamic world as a natural extension of Nazism.
To certain evangelical Christians, it is the holy site of the Second Coming of the Messiah.
So perhaps the existential fear of some Western intellectuals is easier to explain than their remarkable, sometimes fawning trust in the US government to save the world by force.
But a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) shows that shifting demographics pose an even greater threat to the growth prospects of many emerging economies.
Nigeria's labor force is expected to triple from 2014 to 2064, and many other economies in Sub-Saharan Africa will experience similar levels of growth.
Mexico and Saudi Arabia improved their productivity by less than 1% per year over this period; Argentina, Brazil, Russia, and South Africa managed productivity growth of 1.2-1.5%.
There is also enormous scope for productivity-enhancing innovation, particularly in health care, a sector that is just evolving in most emerging countries.
Recognizing this imperative is the first step.
Whether measured by flows (loan disbursements) or stock (loans outstanding), the World Bank is massively over-staffed, with a much higher administrative budget than the EIB.
Meanwhile, the Bank’s extreme risk-averse culture reflects a rational response to critics who make a huge fuss about every project or program failure.
The World Bank will not disappear: there are too many vested interests (including academics and NGOs) eager for a share of other people’s money.
These three trends overlap in a group of about 15 African countries that are strongly committed to accountable governance and sensible economic policies.
Second, it can focus new resources in critical areas such as education, malaria, agriculture, and infrastructure, and ensure that most funding goes to well-governed countries.
As has been the case in some other countries, a return to conflict remains a threat if a clear peace dividend does not quickly materialize throughout the country.
Emerging Infectious Diseases
If doctors were around back then, they would have called all these occurrences EID’s.
But some of the ticks are closely related to known carriers, and thus are potential carriers themselves.
Rapid identification using genetic “bar codes” can increase the rate of discovering species and determining the transmission dynamics of potential EID’s.
All that has kept the much-vaunted font of global capitalism from sliding into cataclysm is the US government, which has effectively become the guarantor and lender of last resort.
Financial development, moreover, is ultimately going to be important for these economies to sustain high growth rates and allow a broader swath of their populations to participate in and benefit from the development process.
It is impractical to devise a regulatory framework that accounts for every specific financial instrument and institution.
Suddenly, something (an increase in United States interest rates, a drop in commodity prices, a domestic political conflict) causes the local currency to drop in value against the dollar.
The bulk of that debt is in Asia, with China alone accounting for approximately $1 trillion.
Conventional wisdom also once held that dollar borrowing binges occur only in countries with fixed exchange rates, with the central bank de facto insuring borrowers against currency risk.
The data are not fully reliable or comparable across countries, but quick calculations reveal that there are many emerging markets where such short-term debt is 50% or more of the stock of international reserves.
For the many emerging-market firms that borrowed in dollars to generate local-currency revenue, the recent depreciation is triggering plenty of financial trouble.
Investors have sat on the sidelines, and the MSCI index that tracks returns on emerging-market equities has stagnated.
Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s vice chairman, said recently that he expects the anticipated increase in the Fed’s policy interest rate later this year to “prove manageable” for emerging-market economies.
Over the last year, the MSCI index for Asia increased by 10%, even as it fell by roughly 14% for emerging and frontier markets and by 21% for emerging markets in Latin America.
But inflation is down; the fiscal situation has improved; and the economy has benefitted from the drop in oil and commodity prices.
Scratch the surface, and you found high growth rates driven not by productive transformation but by domestic demand, in turn fueled by temporary commodity booms and unsustainable levels of public or, more often, private borrowing.
But emerging markets do not deserve the doom-and-gloom treatment they are getting these days.
India’s comparative advantage lies in relatively skill-intensive services – such as information technology – which can absorb no more than a tiny slice of the country’s largely unskilled labor force.
Or compare Brazil with other emerging markets.
As the world economy generates stronger headwinds in the years ahead, it will become easier to distinguish countries that have truly strengthened their economic and political fundamentals from those that have coasted on false narratives and the tenuous strength of fickle investor sentiment.
If the crisis in Europe were to cause annual GDP growth to fall below 7% in China, 5% in India, and 3% in Brazil, these countries’ most vulnerable citizens would be hardest hit.
Whatever the limits or contradictions of shared values, it would be naive to dismiss their importance.
To be sure, this runs counter to the triumphalism emanating from Asia, in particular.
The Europeans are pushing for reform of compensation practices in the financial sector.
Until now, the international regime, led by the IMF and OECD, has pushed countries to allow foreign banks to enter their markets.
The second priority should be defining a strict emerging-market standard for regulating foreign banks after they are allowed in.
Encouraging participation by foreign investors is a quick way to jump-start local bond market activity.
Now consider an alternative method.
And the potential for volatility is particularly great if domestic corporations have large foreign-currency debts, which is true in all of the emerging economies under stress today.
If there are large dollar debts outstanding, and many firms find themselves in the same position, the additional demand for dollars will cause the exchange rate to depreciate even further.
Some of the debt does not even appear in the official statistics of borrowing countries, because it was often taken on not by domestically-based firms, but by their offshore subsidiaries.
The fastest way to adjust is via reduced demand and imports, and that is what almost always ends up happening.
Or look at Indonesia. That economy is still expanding, but at a rate – 4.7% annually in the latest quarter – that is disappointing in terms both of previous expectations and of population growth.
It is that the main determinants of an emerging-economy’s ability actually to emerge, sustainably, are politics, policy and all that is meant by the institutions of governance.
The bottom line is that unless emerging economies can ensure that they remain flexible and adaptable, they will not continue to “emerge.”
Nearly 400 million people have posted their resumes on LinkedIn, and in 2014 the site facilitated more than one million new hires worldwide.
This is because most individuals who find work through digital job platforms operate as independent contractors, leaving them without the benefits and protections provided in standard employment contracts for full-time and part-time workers.
And they should be pro-rated, linking employer benefit contributions to time worked, jobs completed, or income earned.
JOHANNESBURG – Africa is again high on the global agenda, and this time for all the right reasons. As the kickoff to the World Cup in South Africa approaches, people are seeing not just South Africa but our entire continent as equal partners in this extraordinary global celebration.
Africa still lags behind many parts of the world in educating its girls from primary school through to university.
Look in our markets. It is women who you will see buying and selling the goods on offer.
But this ambition will be met only through policies that recognize the central role of women in agriculture and enable them to drive a green revolution on the continent.
For Africa to reach the growth rates needed to meet the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals, women must be brought fully into the formal economy and the financial sector.
The crisis revealed major enforcement problems with this framework, but also major design problems: no light ever flashed red to indicate that Ireland or Spain was in danger.
Crisis management and resolution, meanwhile, could not be reformed, because nothing existed.
Third, just as a new version of existing software often creates compatibility problems with files created with older versions, for EMU, too, transition to the new regime may prove difficult.
So the outcome of months of discussion might be better characterized as “EMU 1.7.3” than “EMU 2.0.”
To see this, consider what a market economy is all about.
But the town’s people would also want access to things that nobody in the city even knows how to make.
Another is to lower wages.
A similar transformation can be seen in every successful non-OPEC developing country.
To survive and thrive, societies need to pay special attention to those activities that produce goods and services they can sell to non-residents.
Ketika pemimpin politik bertemu di Konferensi Tingkat Menteri WTO ke-10 di Nairobi pada bulan Desember, mereka memiliki kesempatan menuju pemenuhan salah satu target tujuan yang terpenting, yakni pelarangan subsidi yang berkontribusi terhadap penangkapan ikan yang berlebihan dan tidak sah, tidak dilaporkan, dan tidak sesuai aturan (overfishing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing) selambatnya pada tahun 2020.
Seiring dengan merosotnya cadangan ikan pada tahun 2005, 5.000 orang memutuskan untuk menggunakan kapal-kapal nelayan mereka yang sudah mubazir untuk kegunaan lain, dengan melarikan diri ke Kepulauan Canary di Spanyol.
Yang dibutuhkan disini adalah pemerintah sepakat untuk mengakhiri ketidakadilan dan limbah yang dihasilkan.
Of course, one explanation for the prolonged bilateral freeze is the warped discourse of what George W. Bush foolishly called the “global war on terror,” in which Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, was cast as part of an international “axis of evil.”
When Khatami’s reform program was ineffective, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an obscure officer of the Basij militia, was elected Mayor of Tehran in 2003 (after just 12% of the city’s voters turned out), and then defeated Rafsanjani in 2005 to become President.
Sadly, Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, forced his president and foreign minister to avoid the planned handshakes with their American counterparts.
For Iran, what counts now is no longer ideology but national interest and realpolitik.
It has not been under Chinese central government rule for more than 100 years – indeed, since it was conquered by Japan at the end of the nineteenth century – and it has never been part of the People’s Republic of China.
To all intents and purposes, Taiwan is independent already, though without formal recognition.
Ultimately, is for Taiwan and China to regulate and resolve their relations.
Such inhumanity cannot plausibly be described as “anti-terrorism,” as Russian President Vladimir Putin insists.
International agreements and the United Nations Charter are as binding in Chechnya as anywhere else.
It would be tragic if, during the G8 summit scheduled for St. Petersburg, Russia, in June 2006, the Chechen issue were pushed to the side.
Following NATO’s intervention, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1244, placing Kosovo under UN administration.
Reintegrating Kosovo into Serbia is not tenable.
What is now required is the will to adopt and implement Ahtisaari’s plan.
Today, as yesterday, the first step towards Serbia’s European integration is full cooperation with the ICTY.
It is shameful that a country known for its democratic values and its unparalleled commitment to human freedom should stoop so low as to kill innocent men, women, and children.
President Asif Ali Zardari went even further, saying that he did not care about the “collateral damage.”
Peace will come when the tribal people, in their hundreds and thousands, no longer see a reason to fight.
There has been much discussion about rich countries’ commitments to increase funds, and whether governments in the developing world have used resources effectively.
In societies where girls are normally married off young, there can seem little point to investing in their education.
But the discrepancy between the scale and seriousness of the problem and the attention it has received is striking.
No religions that we know of explicitly promote child marriage.
This requires sensitive debate, thoughtful leadership, and financial assistance to keep girls in school.
Stern’s sentiment was echoed by Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, who pleaded in favor of stronger climate action to prevent future generations being “roasted, toasted, fried, and grilled.”
This must change.
Supported by a stable, long-term climate-policy framework, public financing can drive the decarbonization of our energy system and our economies.
Kerja sama antara AS, Uni Eropa, dan Jepang berpotensi mendukung langkah besar dalam penyelesaian masalah.
Untungnya penangkapan ikan yang nakal di beberapa negara tidak lagi dipandang sebagai persoalan kebijakan yang terpisah. Pada bulan Maret, Satuan Tugas Presiden Amerika Serikat untuk Pemberantasan Penangkapan Ikan yang Tidak Sah, Tidak Dilaporkan, dan Tidak Sesuai Aturan dan Penipuan Makanan Laut mengeluarkan rencana aksi “semua instansi pemerintah”.
Penangkapan ikan yang tidak sah, tidak dilaporkan, dan tidak sesuai aturan adalah masalah yang dapat diselesaikan melalui kepemimpinan, tindakan, dan kerja sama internasional.
After a policeman died, live ammunition was fired into the crowds – killing a journalist, Bwizamani Singh, and provoking a rebuke from Reporters without Borders.
Instead, women who go to the police are urged not to file a complaint.
You don’t dress in a particular way. Do not live by your freedom….
In the developing world, women are in special jeopardy.
The rate of institutionalization of children with disabilities has remained stable, but is set to be reversed.

In 2005, the last year for which we have statistics, UNICEF estimated that “at least 317,000 children with disabilities in the region live in residential institutions, often for life.”
Lack of resources is no excuse, either.
Ending Nuclear Evil
If they are serious about preventing the spread of these monstrous weapons – and averting their use – they will work energetically and expeditiously to eliminate them completely.
Furthermore, these and other countries’ modernization activities cannot be reconciled with their professed support for a world free of nuclear weapons.
Such a treaty is feasible and must be urgently pursued.
CAMBRIDGE – People often ask if regulators and legislators have fixed the flaws in the financial system that took the world to the brink of a second Great Depression.
In the United States, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was just 37 pages and helped to produce financial stability for the greater part of seven decades.
Let banks design their own risk management systems, audit them to the limited extent possible, and then severely punish them if they produce a loss outside agreed parameters.
The financial industry complains that efforts to force greater equity funding would curtail lending, but this is just nonsense in a general equilibrium setting.
Though the origin of this myth is cloudy, science has proven its falsity, and a globalized world has rendered it anachronistic.
Most agree that it offered a way to consolidate and legitimize a state’s rule over a group of people, whether defined by a common language, culture, or ethnicity.
China is often thought to be governed by the Han majority.
Like religion, the nation-state myth requires a leap of faith. Japanese scholar Yoshihisa Hagiwara argues that since it is not grounded in fact, the nation-state myth is bound to dissolve, giving way to an understanding that we are merely individuals who are part of a global community.
Beyond the core Realist theories of balance of power, an introduction to ethics in international affairs – moral philosophy, human rights, and the role of non-state actors – should be mainstreamed in international relations curricula. 

Over time, economic cooperation between the two sides has grown more complex, and a new legal framework is needed.
In September 2007, a move by the European Commission to prevent foreign companies from controlling European energy transport networks was an example of a skirmish in this “silent war.”
The legitimacy of European laws limiting the scope of Russian business activity in Europe and contradicting WTO regulations would immediately be questioned.
The countries and institutions that have committed additional funds in order to help secure the success of this mission – notably France, Spain, and the European Commission – should all be applauded.
Now that there are signs of possible stabilization in the months to come, it is time to start preparing for increased volumes of international reconstruction and development assistance, in addition to humanitarian aid.
Where such damage looms as a threat, early prevention is required.
But what is needed is an institutional framework that would establish greater political responsibility concerning the primary economic objectives that Europe should pursue – full employment and growth – and that would at least partly close the democratic deficit implied by the ECB’s takeover of monetary policy from euro-zone states.
Yet, fortunately, there is no need for resignation.
BRUSSELS – Has the “energy weapon” of the 1970’s – the withholding of energy supplies for political ends – returned? Using oil or gas as a political weapon is easier said than done, of course, but this year’s renewal of the Russia-Ukraine gas dispute, and the resulting cut-off of supplies to much of the European Union, should concentrate minds on the EU’s need to disarm those who would use the energy weapon.
Only by tying the fates of these projects to each other will Russia’s potential to disrupt them be dissipated.
The EU Commission does seem to be getting this message.  It recently authorized spending 5 billion euros for priority energy projects, including1.75 billion euros for gas and electricity interconnectors, 1.25 billion euros for carbon capture and gas storage, and 250 million euros for Nabucco.  Not enough, of course, but it is a good start.
Energy Independence in an Interdependent World
What happened? The technology of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, by which shale and other tight rock formations at great depths are bombarded with water and chemicals, has released major new supplies of both natural gas and oil.
With respect to climate change, however, the effects of greater reliance on shale gas are mixed.
So, even if America had no other interests in the Middle East, such as Israel or nuclear non-proliferation, a balance of energy imports and exports would be unlikely to free the US from military expenditures – which some experts estimate run to $50 billion per year – to protect oil routes in the region.
A balance of energy imports and exports does not produce pure independence, but it does alter the power relations involved in energy interdependence.
Pada awal pemilihan presiden di Nigeria belakangan ini, seorang wanita ditanya harapannya atas apa yang harus dipenuhi calon presiden. Satu kata jawabnya: “Penerangan”.
Kondisi seperti ini akan terus menjadi persoalan, kecuali dan hanya jika kita mampu menyimpan energi dari sumber-sumber terbarukan secara efisien.
The massive victory of Hamas in the Palestinian parliamentary elections stunned much of the world, but the outcome should not have been so surprising.
We urged the Bush administration to formulate a consistent policy that engages the region’s Islamists who are willing to rule by democratic principles.
In an earlier step toward recognition by the world community, the PLO had to revamp the Palestinian Covenant, which called for the destruction of Israel.
If those leaders could disavow their own violent pasts and take practical steps toward peace in the region, why can’t Hamas?
And, when cancer treatment is needed, its toxic punch hits cancer cells selectively, with far fewer damaging side effects.
In much of the world, we now take these conveniences for granted; indeed, we regard them as necessities.
The industries and economic drivers of the twenty-first century will arise from the increasingly combined efforts of biology and engineering.
The proposal by the Squam Lake Working Group – named for the scenic site in New Hampshire where a group of finance professors first met to devise ideas for responding to the current economic crisis – seems particularly appealing.
The theory of “debt overhang” – the intellectual origin of the proposal – explains why troubled banks are reluctant to issue new equity: the benefits accrue mostly to the bank’s bondholders and dilute existing shareholders.
As a result, the FSB is in a unique position to make innovation happen.
To be sure, this eventuality is being hotly debated.
And yet, as unfair as this may be, the rich are not waiting for the playing field to be leveled; they are making wide use of elite private education.
As justifiable as some of the ethical concerns may be, there are simply too many benefits to be gained from preventing hereditary diseases.
Since the 1980’s, “shareholder value” has increasingly become the focus of corporate governance.
Furthermore, many bank shareholders have suffered from the disruption in lending, either directly or via their businesses or employers.
But their arguments are flawed and misleading.
And such requirements would reduce the likelihood that strong banks would be called upon to finance the resolution of failed institutions. (Of course, these considerations are less relevant if bankers expect to succeed in blocking all regulation aimed at reducing excessive risk-taking, and to be bailed out in a crisis.)
The citizens of today’s free societies are (almost always) democrats out of conviction, custom, and habit.
But what they see is small-mindedness and the pursuit of narrow self-interest.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as one of his first initiatives, proposed a ban on “golden parachutes” for departing managers of firms traded on the stock exchange, in order to halt the practice of taking huge severance payments without the consent of shareholders.
Preserving the democratic life of the EU and its member states implies a duty – which should be enshrined in the treaty – to uphold standards of official behavior that today’s citizens demand.
Given that the HPA calls for helium sales to cease once the debt is paid – that is, this October – the scientific, medical, and technology communities have become increasingly concerned about a massive helium shortage and ballooning costs.
Moreover, the rapid expansion in the US of shale gas, which contains no economically recoverable helium, has squeezed marginal conventional-gas supplies.
Given that the CO2 is not yet being produced and will not be vented, the field’s helium remains inaccessible.
Together, they should produce 25% of the world’s helium during 2014.
But it is not a model for job creation and inclusive growth that policymakers and entrepreneurs elsewhere can emulate – at least not without making some fundamental adjustments.
The key question, then, is how to harness Silicon Valley’s entrepreneurial and innovative prowess to the goal of inclusive economic growth in America’s heartland.
Since 2008, however, few aspiring entrepreneurs have been able to borrow significant amounts of money from banks.
But a growing number of foundations – such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Kresge Foundation – are increasing the share of assets they direct toward investments that further their philanthropy.
Planetary Boundaries and Human Prosperity
Global temperatures rose and fell by no more than one degree Celsius (compared with swings of more than eight degrees Celsius during the last ice age), and resilient ecosystems met humanity’s needs.
As we overdraw on our planet’s accounts, it is starting to levy penalties on the global economy, in the form of extreme weather events, accelerated melting of ice sheets, rapid biodiversity loss, and the vast bleaching of coral reefs.
If we are to ensure that our planet remains one on which all of humanity can thrive, we will have to pursue a new paradigm of prosperity.
In less than 35 years, some 66% of the global population will live in cities. Much of this urban growth will occur in developing countries, especially in Africa.
As we develop a better understanding of ordinary people’s needs and priorities, those negotiating a global agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year would be wise to take note. Opaque decisions and unexplained priorities are unlikely to receive public support.
The belief that boosting equality requires sacrificing economic efficiency is grounded in one of the most cherished ideas in economics: incentives.
Moreover, redistributive policies did not appear to have any detrimental effects on economic performance.
In China, for example, rapid economic growth after the late 1970s was associated with a significant rise in inequality.
If pay differentials have narrowed because of an increase in the relative supply of skilled workers, we can be hopeful that declining inequality in Latin America will not stand in the way of faster growth (and may even be an early indicator of it).
CAMBRIDGE – How should one understand the disconnect between the new highs reached by global equity indices and the new depths plumbed by real interest rates worldwide? Several competing explanations attempt to reconcile these trends, and getting it right is essential for calibrating monetary and fiscal policy appropriately.
Another possible explanation of low interest rates is financial repression.
Adverse demographics and declining labor-supply growth in most advanced economies are undeniably important.
The problem is that the government likely faces high costs if a disaster strikes, which implies a high option value to preserving fiscal space for when it is most needed.
Despite recent challenges, Pakistan put vaccinators back on the job in 28 districts, where 12 million children needed to be reached.
The simultaneous scaling back of the local-government system, along with the divisive politics of coalition governments in Pakistan’s fragile democracy, continues to undermine implementation of the polio eradication program.
As in Nigeria, vaccination delays will be highly detrimental for neighboring countries.
Polio today has become an example of the complex problems plaguing Pakistan’s state and its society.
Government prosecutors have mounted a series of sham trials, charging hundreds of military officers, academics, and journalists with membership in an armed terrorist organization aiming to topple the Erdoğan government.
For example, the alleged 2003 coup plot was supposedly discovered when CDs containing detailed preparations (including assassination teams and plans to bomb two mosques) were delivered to a virulently anti-military newspaper.
No friend of the army, he pursued rogue elements within the military in a famous investigation several years ago.
The amended constitution expands the constitutional court and the supreme council of judges and prosecutors.
That year marked the last gasp of the authoritarian/bureaucratic regime that emerged in the early 1920’s, and that had become so isolated from the public that its legitimacy had evaporated.
That decade was characterized by low and unstable growth; low per capita GDP, at around $3,400 dollars; dramatically low productivity; an unsustainable fiscal and financial position in both the public and private sectors; average annual inflation of 70% for more than two decades; a lack of competitiveness, reflected in 10% unemployment; and widespread corruption.
Indeed, annual real GDP rose by 9% in 2010.
The question now is how Turkey will use its rapidly growing economic power.
Much has changed in the Middle East during the past two years, and not to Turkey’s advantage. As a result, Turkey is now seeking to contain a rapidly deteriorating regional security situation.
Having had direct meetings with both Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Erdoğan was in a unique position, as a prime minister of a NATO country, to convey these critical messages to a regime whose top-level decision-making processes remain as opaque as ever to the West.
ISTANBUL – In very few democracies could such a small shift in votes lead to outcomes as different as the ones that could result from Turkey’s general election on June 7.
This year, however, the Kurdish political movement has decided to field its candidates as members of a single party.
Far from securing a dominant position, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu would be forced to choose between aligning his party with the HDP or the conservative Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).
Erdoğan’s Second Chance
The political instability following June’s inconclusive election had been compounded by a sharp decline in domestic and regional security.
In the end, HDP ended with 10.75% of the vote, down from 13% in the June elections, preventing Erdoğan from securing the compliant parliament he would need to establish an executive presidency.
The AKP should take comfort in its large majority and start to view minority views and even peaceful dissent more benignly, in a way that befits a country negotiating accession to the European Union.
It is said to be an excellent chronicle of the court’s day-to-day goings-on, revealing, for example, that the emperor celebrated Christmas as a boy, that he had nose surgery in his youth, and how often he met with whom.
On September 6, an imperial conference was convened to approve a timetable for war mobilization in the event of a breakdown in US-Japanese diplomatic talks.
For months, he told himself and others that first “Japan must have another brilliant military gain” over the US, so that it would have a modicum of diplomatic clout in negotiating a postwar settlement.
But, for now, Hirohito remains a singularly unfathomable and isolated character who defies common understandings – alas, to the detriment of a better understanding of “what actually happened.”
However, they do not reach all places.
Moreover, TAP membership would be voluntary, an important advantage over the FTAA.
But, as the boom recedes, a deep, debilitating weakness is becoming increasingly apparent: the region’s inadequate education systems.
Once foreign investment and higher commodity export prices are excluded from the growth calculations, Latin America’s recent economic performance barely exceeds its unexceptional historical average.
Workers are either forced into the informal sector, where basic workplace protections are absent, or they become reliant on state handouts, creating fertile ground for populist politicians and criminals.
What is at issue is the law-enforcement authorities’ independence and impartiality.
When Turkey became a democracy in 1950, the previous system’s secular Kemalist elites attempted to harness the power of the military and the bureaucracy to control the elected government.
Although Gülen followers have disagreed with several of the government’s policies, they largely backed the AKP in the last three elections.
But all of the signs point to a coordinated political crusade by Gülen followers, including the chief prosecutors involved in the recent corruption cases and the pro-Gülen media that have steadfastly defended the prosecutors’ impartiality (despite the many irregularities – such as extensive unauthorized wiretaps – that have come to light).
Moldova and Georgia were in the last category until recently.
Estonia’s experience suggests how Georgia and Moldova should shape their policies vis-à-vis Russia.
True, Georgia seemed a less appealing partner than the Baltic states.
Russia, and to some extent the United States, are the powers that matter in Georgia.
Moldova is deeply in debt, unemployment is high, and its once well-regarded wine industry is in decline.
It always comes back to oil.
The overthrow of Saddam was the longstanding pet idea of the neoconservative Project for a New American Century, which was already arguing in the 1990’s that Saddam was likely to achieve a stranglehold over “a significant proportion of the world’s oil supplies.”
Important energy technologies will include conversion of coal to liquids (such as gasoline), use of tar sands and oil shale, and growth in non-fossil-fuel energy sources.
Of course, there are also major political, regulatory, and security considerations, all of which need to be addressed properly.
This is the central problem confronting the world as it seeks to forge a framework to combat climate change.
Just waiting for the high-growth developing countries to catch up with the advanced countries is even less of a solution.
The ingredients for such a grand bargain are fairly clear.
Conflict between advanced and developing countries over responsibility for mitigating carbon emissions should not be allowed to undermine prospects for a global agreement.
The high level of income inequality requires specific poverty reduction efforts.
Conditional cash transfers are another option for Latin American policy makers to consider.
Early childhood development projects – designed to improve children’s physical, intellectual, and social development – form a third effective set of redistributive policies.
The Anti-Fragility of Health
Most dictionaries define health as the “absence of disease.” But, in those terms, it is not a compelling proposition for people to “invest in health.”
Like education, health ultimately demands the active participation of the individuals involved.
When it comes to producing health, virtually everyone is a volunteer.
The argument that “the other guys do it” is lame, but it is also true.
But what of the assumptions that we rarely question? Yes, our government’s primary job is to protect us; but people die all the time, often unfairly, and there are limits on how much protection we seek or even allow.
That is crazy.
But just having the truth does not create accountability by itself.
Badly behaved movie stars and politicians skew ideas of the norm – or of what should be acceptable.
The problem is not that Watsi is a bad service.
It is like looking through a telescope: a lot of detail, no perspective.
Let’s help people build their own societies.
A speaker may want to promote his or her employer, or find a new one.
Of course, many conferences combine the two models.
Oh, they're evil, was the reply.
Much of today’s time-based pricing can be traced back to the topics that were explained and explored at that event.
What has people outraged is the notion that Facebook is manipulating its unwitting users to advance its own agenda, with many citing the secrecy surrounding the research to illustrate the company’s misconduct (though the company published the results with no apparent sense of unease).
When forces beyond our control make us unhappy, at least we do not feel angry with ourselves for putting ourselves in that position.
But marketers also regularly test users’ emotional reactions to less explicit aspects of their products, from the color of their packaging or their placement in the store to their celebrity spokesperson.
NEW YORK – Why is privacy such a challenge for private companies? (Governments have their own problems, but that is another story.)
There are many such “customer relationship” services, which rely on data sources that match usernames and email addresses using unspecified means.
The question is how to distinguish between the two groups.
The film’s protagonist soon falls in love with one of these operating systems.
The concreteness of the data scares them.
Academic studies have found that locally cultivated vertical farms – stacked greenhouses that use artificial light to grow crops – can provide considerable savings, which could then be passed along to consumers.
PlantLab’s pitch is that a PPU the size of a city block and just a few stories high could produce the same volume of high-quality crops as a large farm, while consuming fewer resources.
And it would supply 50,000 people with a consistently high-quality seven-ounce (198.4 grams) daily requirement of fresh herbs, vegetables, and ground fruits like berries for at least ten years – all in less space that the average multi-story parking lot.
If the company’s processes offer all of the benefits that it claims, I hope that its founders license their patents broadly over time.
The Great Global Bazaar
Late communism was a strange time indeed.
That is precisely the attitude that I hope to bring to my travels within the United States for The Way to Wellville contest, in which five communities will compete to improve their health.
But earlier this month I attended School Food FOCUS’s “National Gathering.” I found it both heartwarming and thought-provoking.
Indeed, FOCUS turns the vendors into allies – and sponsors.
Restaurant chains such as McDonald’s, for example, have transformed agriculture around the world with their homogenizing requirements for meat, bread, potatoes, and the like. Under the assumption that consistency equals quality, variation in the size or color of, say, tomatoes has come to be considered bad (unless one calls them “heirloom” tomatoes and emphasizes their uniqueness).
Now I worry that they are terribly inefficient.
Management makes a difference, one that ultimately boils down to good leadership and best practices.
In the case of for-profit goods and services, customers and payers are the same people; they monitor the quality themselves.
The BCHD has 70 staff and about 700 volunteers.
While I expect to learn much more as I work on HICCup, I am already sure that the biggest problem will be finding people to take on the challenges in each community.  What’s the optimal balance between replicability and the human touch?
This is a well-known phenomenon known as loss aversion: the risk of a one outweighs the hope of a five.
If you are a customer buying a product that should work, you want the nine out of ten; if you are a venture capitalist who thinks she can add value, you want the eight out of 20.
It would be nice to understand those numbers better.
At the bottom were 25% who had a police record for some kind of bad behavior.
Now that the taper has been postponed, capital is flowing back in some cases.
Second, there are policy failures, which occur when undisciplined macroeconomic policies and inconsistent or ineffective financial regulatory policies heighten the risks associated with volatile capital flows.
So how can policymakers address these failures? There has been some progress at the international level on regulatory reforms aimed at addressing market failures, though such efforts have been limited by strident resistance from financial institutions.
In India, for example, increasing productivity and long-term growth require fiscal discipline and a raft of financial- and labor-market reforms.
To be sure, China already plays a significant role in international trade and finance, with major financial centers like London and Frankfurt eagerly lining up for renminbi business.
Foreign investors now hold more than $5.7 trillion of these low-yielding securities, not to mention large quantities of other dollar assets.
This contrasts sharply with China’s single-party system, in which the level of government accountability is much lower.
"Everything . . . everything changes."
They believe we will be condemned to the abyss unless we accept rules created by the world's powerful.
Indeed, Argentina's case is pathetic.
The more we pay, the more we seem to owe and the less we have.
Eternal Hong Kong
In short, ours is a system of government like many others.
Inevitably, this will often involve compromise.
This is an all-encompassing brief, covering everything we do as a community and an economy in areas ranging from international trade to art, culture, and tourism.
But, above all, it is an honor and a privilege to play such a role in our society, and I know that the vast majority of officials, legislators, judges, and civil servants with whom I’ve worked would agree.
In contrast to 1929, credits are not now being throttled; on the contrary, public money is being pumped into banks and the economy.
The fatal human instincts of greed and hubris can be tamed only with some elementary ethical norms.
• We must value a sense of moderation and modesty instead of an unquenchable greed for money, prestige, and consumption.
Vienna – The European Union, the United States, and other major donors will pump about $2.5 billion into Ethiopia this year, a sum that does not even begin to include the cost of medicines, famine relief, and countless other services provided by non-profit groups in one of the world’s most impoverished countries.
Some journalists and politicians sought asylum in other countries.
Yet badgering or jailing journalists is no way to resolve what could be handled through a voluntary media council or independent ombudsman.
·        Donors should deny Ethiopian ministers a seat at diplomatic tables, such as the coveted spot Zenawi got at the G-20 summit in London as head of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development;
LONDON – There is something rotten about the European Union’s debate on migration.
Given its close proximity to a deadly conflict in Syria and countries marked by extreme poverty, human-rights abuses, and weak or collapsed states and economies, the EU is inevitably a magnet for migrants and asylum-seekers.
According to Frontex, roughly a quarter of the migrants who crossed the Mediterranean in 2014 were Syrian families escaping the civil war there.
Europe’s institutional response is to view all migration as a border-management issue.
Instead, acting on the EU’s founding values, member states should co-finance a search and rescue operation along the lines of Mare Nostrum; strengthen their efforts to protect the rights of refugees; and share the burden of granting asylum.
LONDON – Is £1.7 billion ($2.7 billion) a lot of money for the British government to fork out?
UKIP could conceivably hold the balance of power following next May’s general election, and force the government to hold its promised “in-out” referendum on EU membership.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi duly joined the chorus of outrage, calling the recalculation a “lethal weapon.”
Taken to its logical extreme, member countries would demand recalculations to reflect the different ways they measure income and wealth, thereby pitting potential beneficiary countries against contributors.
In June, the EU’s home and justice ministers voted to retain significant national powers over the protection of digital privacy, rather than creating a single set of rules that would apply in all 28 EU countries.
It aimed to harmonize Europe’s fragmented legal framework, provide businesses with a helpful “one-stop shop,” and reassure consumers that their data were being used properly.
But Europe’s online sector is dominated by business-to-business companies with little-known brands that process consumer data but lack direct contact with users.
BRUSSELS – The fiscal rules of the European Union have undergone some much-needed improvements in recent years, but much more needs to be done.
But it would require a more sophisticated analytical framework than the current one, which merely distinguishes between countries on the basis of whether they meet the EU’s 60%-of-GDP ceiling on public debt.
One possible vehicle for accomplishing this is the independent councils that the EU’s so-called fiscal compact has now made mandatory for every country in the eurozone.
The EFC would be authorized to request an amended assessment of a country’s fiscal trajectory and requirements.
Continued technological progress suggests that renewable energies – from wind and solar to, perhaps, planetary winds – may ultimately supplant fossil fuels, anyway.
European leaders are well aware of the risks their economies face.
“Astana,” he vowed, “will never be in an organization which represents a threat to the independence of Kazakhstan.”
For EU leaders, the time has come to think ahead.
Unfortunately, either outcome would merely delay a politics-induced crisis in the EU. After all, in Italy, too, the signs point to a coming storm – one bearing down not only on austerity, but also increasingly on the euro itself.
It is no exaggeration to say that the EU is currently both internally and externally threatened by reactionary nationalism, which is why the next euro crisis will come in the form of a political crisis. So why are the authorities in Berlin, Brussels, and the other EU capitals still not willing to change their policies, which quite obviously have made a bad situation worse?
Being left out of the labor market increases the risk of poverty and poor health, and the longer unemployment lasts, the more damaging the effects.
Germany ranks a distant second, with 21% of those surveyed saying they would prefer a permanent position.
In February 2013, EU leaders launched a Youth Employment Initiative, with a budget of €6 billion, to help alleviate the problem. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted in June 2014 that the initiative has so far been a failure.
But protracted economic crisis has changed their citizens' perspective, with a rising proportion viewing EU membership as more costly than beneficial.
But they are also interdependent, with each member's actions shaped by external factors.
When financially stable countries disregard the challenges facing their struggling counterparts, they are acting against their own interests.
It would also help if creditors understood that their contributions, like their decades of support to cohesion funds, will not impoverish them (by, say, depleting their public pensions).
BERLIN – For many centuries, Europe was a continent plagued by wars, famines, and poverty.
Throughout Europe, xenophobia and open racism are running rampant, and nationalist, even far-right parties are gaining ground.
Clearly, the EU must substantially strengthen its Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the European Neighborhood Policy, in order to address more effectively the causes of migration at the source.
The Roma suffered disproportionately after the collapse of communism in 1989, as they worked largely in unskilled industrial jobs that were the first to be cut.
From Ukraine to Greece, events have led the continent from the frying pan to the fire and back again, with all of the attendant summitry, declarations, and brinkmanship.
The port of Calais has become a chokepoint of the crisis, with migrants desperately trying to force their way onto trucks and trains bound for the United Kingdom.
After all, the factors driving hundreds of thousands of people to risk everything to get to Europe are nowhere near being resolved.
All of this will require an update of the legal categorizations of migrants, as well as burden-sharing within the EU, which is glaringly absent at the moment.
But none has raised such fundamental questions about the meaning of the EU as the current debate about migration.
At first glance, the relocation system – which would move 40,000 asylum-seekers from Italy and Greece to other EU members countries, with the allocation determined according to factors such as GDP, population, and the unemployment rate – may seem like a substantial step.
Instead of reinforcing its foundations with solidarity and compassion, the Union has fractured.
No response, it must be stressed, would be complete without a sustained commitment to addressing the drivers of mass immigration – and that means a complete overhaul of the EU’s Neighborhood Policy.
Yanukovych, failing to crush them with his security forces, simply fled.
His main geopolitical project was now the creation of the Eurasian Union, which he knew could not succeed without forcing Ukraine off of its EU path and into his embrace.
When I left the Vilnius meeting in 2013, I could certainly see storm clouds gathering, but I did not know that Putin was prepared to unleash so much aggression and turmoil.
By confirming the Eastern Partnership agreements, the EU’s leaders will demonstrate that they are not prepared to acquiesce in a new Yalta-style division of the continent that would deprive these countries of their right to choose their own destiny.
That the EU needs a new security strategy is clear.
The difficulty of integrating immigrant communities into European societies has sometimes led to radicalization, providing ammunition to nationalist politicians and further fracturing Europe.
Federica Mogherini, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, is correct when she urges the close involvement of member states in the discussions, in order to give them a sense of ownership over whatever strategy emerges.
ROME – Later this year, Turkey will host the 2015 G-20 Leaders' Summit, the tenth annual meeting of the G-20 heads of government.
The EU accounts for almost 40% of Turkish trade, 70% of its foreign direct investment, and more than 50% of its tourism industry.
The country risks being sucked into the region's sectarian conflicts – and being tempted by the authoritarian sirens of Vladimir Putin's Russia.
This would enable the EU to open chapters 23 and 24 of the accession talks – those that deal with rights, fundamental freedoms, and the judiciary – as the European Parliament and the European Commission advocate.
MUNICH – The euro has brought a balance-of-payments crisis to Europe, just as the gold standard did in the 1920s.
Ireland was on its own, so it had no option but to implement massive austerity measures, reducing its product prices relative to other eurozone countries by 13% from peak to trough.
Each path is associated with serious complications.
Of course, in that case the north needs to inflate faster than by just 2%.
Moreover, the southern EU countries, instead of leaving prices unchanged, could abandon austerity and issue an ever greater volume of new bonds to stimulate the economy.
A strong dollar and a weak euro is certainly the most popular bet of 2015.
On the side of a stronger dollar and weaker euro, there seem to be three possibilities.
Many countries have spent decades diversifying their wealth away from dollars, for both financial and geopolitical reasons.
As we know from decades of Japanese and Swiss experience, selling a low-interest-rate currency simply to chase higher US yields is often a costly mistake.
The five countries in trouble will need to place tens of billions of euros in new debt and roll over even larger amounts of old debt.
Nineteen years of experience with the Maastricht Treaty, which created both the EU and the euro, has shown convincingly that such limits are unenforceable.
Sweden and Chile are almost poles apart geographically, but both have used sophisticated fiscal rules successfully.
America’s capital is once again abuzz with talk of war, not only of the latest “strategy for victory” in Iraq, but now also of military action against Iran.
As with Iraq, America’s strength may be enough to start a war, but not to win it.
Germany now wants to send some Tornado jets for reconnaissance purposes – better than nothing, but not by much.
The Europeans – led by Merkel, Blair, and Chirac – should agree to assure the US that Europe is ready to pay a high, perhaps very high, economic price by taking decisive action to intensify the sanctions against Iran.
From that standpoint, in spite of a rapprochement between France and the United States, culminating in a joint UN resolution, the latest Middle East war is in reality widening and deepening the emotional gap that has existed between Europe and the US since the war in Iraq began.
With the passing of time and the transformation of Israel from a small pioneer state to a regional superpower, Israel’s image became blurred and progressively negative, while sympathy for the Palestinian cause spread, despite Palestinian terrorism.
By contrast, Spain and Italy are more critical and have moved closer to France.
Given that Europe’s legacies of anti-Semitism and colonialism stand at the origins of the Middle East’s core problems, the EU could have been at least part of the solution.
The conference also featured a panel on an unusual subject – “The American Oil and Gas Bonanza: The Changing Geopolitics of Energy.”
In a nutshell, if gas is exported in liquid form, it is fungible.
No one thought that the European Union’s troubles were resolved, but no one thought that the eurozone was coming apart, either.
As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared in one of her last foreign-policy speeches, the US is not planning to pivot away from Europe to Asia, but rather with Europe to Asia.
In order to do so, the People’s Republic needs much more sophisticated arms than those it possesses today.
How did China and France manage to fool the EU into thinking that it should ever take part in this? When Jacques Chirac’s government decided to expound its economic co-operation with China, arms became an important component in the strategy.
Typically enough, no EU-country has mentioned Taiwan as a reason not to resume arms exports.
Lantos knows about moral compasses: as a boy, he was rescued by Raoul Wallenberg from being deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis in Budapest.
Europe and the Arab Spring
In Tunisia and Egypt, they have demonstrated their resolve by overturning regimes which many in the West saw as guarantors of stability.
These countries must invest more and educate better, which will inevitably be costly.
Today, migration is extremely circumscribed.
PRINCETON – Fiscal unification is often an effective way to enhance creditworthiness, and it may also create a new sense of solidarity among diverse peoples living within a large geographic area.
France latched onto the idea, because its borrowing capacity was also weaker than Britain’s.
Post-1945 West Germany was vulnerable for a long time, because it sat on the Cold War’s fault line.
Because Europe is at peace, with no singular, overriding security threat, it is likely that when the extent of the bargain becomes clear, voters and politicians in the rich creditor countries will reject it.
First of all, it should be recalled that the European idea began as a project for ensuring peace and democracy among Europe’s peoples.
Just how cohesive Europe can be is something that we know from the experience of the past few months.
Following the European Council meeting in June, France and Germany jointly outlined a number of possible reforms.
Indeed, according to Eurostat (the EU’s statistical office), by the second quarter of 2010, the eurozone was growing faster than the US, while the euro remains the second most widely used trading currency.
The Davos World Economic Forum ranks food insecurity as a major risk to humanity.
But Europe cannot build up its own agriculture to the detriment of the less fortunate.
It will also make it possible to ensure that today’s high prices for agricultural products are transformed into opportunity for poor farmers.
Instead, bringing together outside expertise and local knowledge of the geography and environmental and economic constraints in order to spread risks and share the management of resources and projects is far more likely to help poor countries achieve food independence.
To our north, Europe is at a crossroads, undergoing a process of creative destruction, with potentially far-reaching ramifications well beyond the confines of the European Union.
Of course, it is still too early to predict the outcome of the Arab Awakening, and the countries in transition still face daunting challenges.
Instead, they have gotten an inhuman campaign of violence – including attacks by warplanes, helicopters, and tanks – by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.
On the contrary, this aggression, clearly staged for domestic political consumption, will harm Israel’s long-term security.
Europe and the New World Order
The US has responded to the decline of its global strength in an impressive manner, with the election of its first African-American president, Barack Obama.
For the foreseeable future, the greatest opportunities for growth lie in this region, and for both economic and geopolitical reasons America will increasingly turn toward the Pacific region, thus downgrading its transatlantic orientation.
Europe and the Rising Powers
Defending the national interest still rallies their publics; the exercise of power remains at the heart of their diplomatic calculations.
Indeed, China has been pouring billions of dollars into developing the oil and gas fields of Iraq and Iran.
Moreover, Ukraine’s politics is fracturing.
This requires better relations with all of the world’s rising powers.
The Reform Treaty’s shortcomings are obvious.
The list could continue, but we already have reason enough to conclude that getting the best out of the new Treaty will be the best that the EU and its member states can do.
Europe’s Two Futures
With Russian-backed separatists – and maybe even Russian troops – battling government forces in Ukraine, the specter of war is once again stalking the continent.
Though tensions between China and its neighbors over territorial claims in the East and South China Seas have receded somewhat in recent months, the prospect of worsening Sino-Japanese relations, in particular, remains worrisome.
The so-called “European Neighborhood Policy” has, so far, been a curious thing.
The threats concentrated in the Middle East are diverse: regional conflicts, totalitarian religious ideologies, terrorism, nuclear armament programs, blockades to modernization, unstable regimes and hegemonic ambitions.
The war did not bring forth a real decision.
With its decision in favor of the mission in Lebanon, the EU crossed a military Rubicon.
Why Deflation is Good News for Europe
This deflation is bad, it is argued, because it makes it harder for debtors, especially in the troubled economies of the eurozone's periphery (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain), to pay what they owe.
Because wages can increase to a greater extent without fueling inflation, the US Federal Reserve Board might be inclined to delay hiking interest rates, which it is now widely expected to do this summer.
In reality, lower oil prices represent a boon for Europe – especially for its most beleaguered nations.
Today it crawls forward at about 0.5% a year.
Another factor that may be contributing to flat productivity is that many corporations run traditional physical business models parallel to new digital ones.
Fortunately, there is much that can be done.
The question today is whether the EU can respond effectively to major external shocks.
Yet three internal fault lines are making it difficult for the EU to achieve these ends.
But it would be both a blunder and a tragedy were Britons to vote for “Brexit” as a form of protection against tumult on the continent.
His Slovak counterpart, Robert Fico, announced in July that his country would accept only Christian refugees.
Since the November 13 attacks in Paris, security has become the overriding French objective.
Sigmar Gabriel and Emmanuel Macron, the German and French economy ministers, recently called for a common fund to address Europe’s refugee and security challenges and to finance joint policies.
Call it Putinomics in Russia, Órbanomics in Hungary, Erdoğanomics in Turkey, or a decade of Berlusconomics from which Italy is still recovering.
Most of these parties tend to be socially conservative.
Or a British exit from the EU may trigger European dis-integration, with the additional risks posed by the fact that some countries (the UK, Spain, and Belgium) are at risk of breaking up themselves.
Europe’s Poisoned Chalice of Growth
So other factors must be at work.
The ECB has also promised to support other countries’ bond markets in the event of a Greek accident.
Everyone understands that compromise is preferable to the collapse of negotiations, disorderly default, and Greece’s forced exit from the eurozone.
The problem, quite simply, is that many of the underlying conditions that produced the eurozone crisis remain unaddressed.
France does.
Former EU heads of state have also backed a proposal from European Jewish leaders to criminalize in every EU country not just anti-Semitism and genocide-denial, but also "xenophobia" in general.
But inciting violence is banned in the US as well.
It would be useful in the current climate of fear to recall a famous hate-speech case in the US.
Terrorist attacks are doing enough damage, in lives and property. There is no reason for governments to make things worse by tampering with their citizens' liberties.
Yet advanced countries still account for more than 40% of global consumption and resource depletion.
Capitalism has perhaps eroded rents that workers in advanced countries enjoy by virtue of where they were born.
That may be practical, but it certainly is not morally defensible.
The arrival of desperate boat people on Europe’s shores is a symptom of their failure to do so.
Any weakening of these two institutions would cause severe damage to common European interests.
Given the exposure of some euro-zone states such as Austria, this crisis will also affect the euro area directly.
The EU was and is institutionalized compromise, and must remain so now, in the midst of a global economic crisis.
The eurozone as such has no representation in the international financial institutions.
Contrast this current condition of extended misery with the only sensible long-term solution: a pooling of IMF quotas by all eurozone countries.
Until now, the rest of world could only grumble at Europe’s obstinate refusal to recognize its relative decline.
Funding the next intra-eurozone rescue will be rather cumbersome and costly, because financial markets distrust complicated structures like the one set up to finance the EFSF.
To be sure, the US is in an interregnum until the election of a new president.
True, everybody is complaining about America’s speculative bubble, and they are right to do so. But the whole world economy – from China to Germany – benefited for decades from Americans’ debt-driven over-consumption.
For many years, France has called for a European economic government for the euro zone, which Germany has so far rejected, for good reasons: France’s initiative was nothing but a hidden attack against EU members’ annual fiscal-deficit ceiling of 3% of GDP and worse, against the ECB’s independence.
This means not dividing Europe, but forming an active and inclusive avant garde.
Meanwhile, average public debt has soared to 87% of GDP, leaving little space for policy flexibility or innovation.
They warned that, “Absent profound change, in 20 or 30 years the share of Europe [in world output] will be significantly lower than it is today, and, perhaps more important, its political influence will be much trimmed.”
Most striking is European backwardness in high-tech development and innovation.
The rest of the EU should not only follow suit; they should also cut income and payroll taxes and liberalize their labor markets.
The French actions follow changes in Germany, where some recent wage settlements resulted in longer working times.
The next step for France could be unpaid increases in working times.
The lump-of-labor theory assumes that working longer and employing more people is the same thing.
Would there be enough demand to absorb the additional output resulting from increasing the workday? Advocates of the lump-of-labor view say no.
In any case, only the second interpretation is correct.
The report also details the destruction of schools, the post-conflict mental health problems faced by the young, and the imprisonment of children.
As a group of eminent European politicians recently noted, a two-state peace deal could be lost, leaving Israel to face a stark choice: become a non-Jewish democracy or a Jewish non-democracy.
First, Israeli spokesmen accuse Europeans of anti-Semitism – that hateful blot on Europe’s history.
Until that happens, the children – the overwhelming majority of them Palestinian –will continue to suffer.
Does it plan to swallow Ukraine, Belarus, and the Caucasus?
Even if the results on the ground in Africa don’t yet look spectacular to outsiders, the change in attitude is real.
Call this the “paradox of enlargement.”
A divisive transatlantic rivalry offers no ethical or political basis for an enlightened European approach.
At first glance, the results of recent elections in France and England might give the impression that European migration is on the wane as a hot-button issue.
Both Duda and Kukiz complained that too many young Poles were leaving the country, and that their country was becoming an empty land of the elderly – a fact that is obvious to anyone who walks down a Polish street.
इस पृष्ठभूमि में - और पेरिस एवं कोपेनहेगन में आतंकी हमलों से उत्प‍न्न भय को देखते हुए - यूरोपीय संघ, आप्रवास के मुद्दे पर एक नई और अत्यंत महत्वपूर्ण योजना तैयार करने के लिए कमर कस चुका है। इस मुद्दे पर आगे की कार्रवाई हेतु विचार-विमर्श करने के लिए जब यूरोपीय संघ के आयुक्तों की बैठक होगी, तो उन्हें तात्कालिक एवं भावनात्मक समाधानों के प्रलोभन से बचना होगा, और इसके बजाय अपने देश और विदेश दोनों के लिए सचमुच रचनात्मक और व्यापक योजना तैयार करनी होगी।
इसके लिए अधिक बेहतर और सक्रिय नज़रिए की जरूरत है।,इसका तात्कालिक आवश्यक उपाय तो संसाधनों में वृद्धि करना है लेकिन कार्रवाई की दृष्टि से व्यावहारिक यही होगा कि लोगों की जान बचाने के स्पष्ट दिशा-निर्देशों सहित यूरोपीय संघ की ओर से संयुक्त रूप से गहन समुद्री निगरानी प्रक्रिया शुरू की जाए।
New Europe’s Old Ghosts
The same month, up to two million pro-independence Catalans marched through Barcelona, in what may have been the largest demonstration ever seen in Europe.
For its part, Germany exacts austerity as the price of its participation in the single currency.
Now that Putin has made muscle-flexing his main form of diplomacy – not merely in Ukraine and the Baltic states, but also in the Balkans and the North Sea – it has fallen to Germany to shape Europe’s response.
This trend was starkly apparent last week during a visit to the Netherlands, one of the six original signatories of the Treaty of Rome.
But in the old Rijksmuseum, no room was required to celebrate that defeat.
But what if that national pride takes hold at a time of deep, even existential, doubt about the value of Europe? While most Europeans understand that their countries cannot address the challenges facing them alone, they are losing faith that Europe is the answer.
A group of farsighted statesmen, inspired by the vision of a United States of Europe, recognized that this ideal could be approached only gradually, by setting limited objectives, mobilizing the political will needed to achieve them, and concluding treaties that required states to surrender only as much sovereignty as they could bear politically.
And, even there, they relied too heavily on self-policing by sovereign states.
This created a two-speed Europe, with debtor countries sinking under the weight of their liabilities, and surplus countries forging ahead.
If this seemingly inexorable process is to be arrested and reversed, both Greece and the eurozone must urgently adopt a Plan B. A Greek default may be inevitable, but it need not be disorderly.
Germany is the new Promised Land for the desperate and downtrodden, the survivors of war and pillage.
The mood in contemporary Germany may be exceptional.
But most people crossing European borders to find work and build new lives are not refugees. When British officials said that it was “clearly disappointing” that about 300,000 more people came to Britain than left in 2014, they were not mainly talking about asylum-seekers.
It is, in any case, easier to appeal to compassion for refugees than to the acceptance of economic migrants. Even in Germany.
But economic migration from non-EU countries, under carefully managed conditions, is both legitimate and imperative.

Europe needs to make up its mind
Related to this is the idea that only a strong EU can save the “European social model.”
Elements of this vision sound attractive.
The demoi-crats win support because their vision tends to reinforce the status quo and leaves nearly all options open.
In just the first few months of 2015, more than 38,000 people have attempted to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa.
The International Organization for Migration, together with Italy’s navy, has determined that this year’s migrants hail mainly from Eritrea, Gambia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Syria ‒ countries where conditions entitle their citizens to request asylum.
Indeed, many European countries have accepted very few refugees so far, making their inaction even more difficult to comprehend.
To retain its moral and political authority, the European Union – perhaps the most compelling example of how cooperation can support peace and prosperity – must implicate itself beyond its frontiers in a sincere and determined way, reaching mutually beneficial agreements with its southern neighbors.
Although some Americans always like to boast about their superior work ethic, this disparity in working hours between the US and Europe has not always existed.
The importance of vacation time should come as no surprise to anyone who has experienced Europe's deserted cities in August, the three-week vacation "bridges" in April and May in France and Italy, the "rush hours" that take place every Friday at 2 PM in German cities, and crowded ski slopes in February due to winter school vacations.
For the age group over 50, the structure of pension systems is clearly a major factor. It was and remains much more profitable to retire earlier in Europe than in the US.
Europeans certainly need something to compensate for a short working life with many vacations.
The euro’s survival and, indeed, that of the European Union hang in the balance.
But Europe doesn’t have months, much less years, to resolve its crisis.
The second urgent task is to create breathing space for Greece.
Those who have spoken of a Marshall Plan for Greece can put their money where their mouths are.
If these three urgent tasks are completed, there will be plenty of time – and much time will be needed – to contemplate radical changes like new budgetary rules, harmonization of other national policies, and a move to full fiscal union.
American Express and Daimler are matching their employees’ donations, Western Union is offering ten cents per transaction made by consumers in the European Union, and Norwegian Air has raised money through inflight collections.
But the current crisis also has an economic component: in many cases, it represents a business opportunity, as new arrivals offer their talents and knowledge to forward-thinking firms.
Local spikes in unemployment, temporary pressure on education and health services, incidents of criminality, and hints of radicalization could spark a backlash in the media and among shareholders.
The real challenge in Europe is continued stagnation and rising public-sector fiscal pressures in bloated welfare states with rapidly aging populations.
High taxes and burdensome regulations stifle the labor market and potential new businesses.
Finally, Europe faces a severe governance deficit.
Meanwhile, Europe's zombie banks will have to be rapidly resolved by acquisition or temporary takeover, cleanup, and asset sale, as was done by the Resolution Trust Corporation during the US savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.
LONDON – In 2014, more than 190,000 people risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to Europe.
Efforts to discourage refugees from arriving have not diminished the number of people who are granted asylum in Europe; they have merely made the process of being granted refugee status more random and dangerous.
There is no reason that something similar cannot be done for those fleeing violence and persecution today.
LONDON – The death toll resulting from Europe’s paralysis in responding to the influx of refugees from the Middle East and Africa continues to rise.
So, regardless of what European leaders decide at their latest summit, it is past time for the international community to act in support of the world’s refugees and others who have been forcibly displaced.
Resettlement via “private sponsorship” – whereby individuals, communities, and NGOs take responsibility for families – is stymied only by governments’ failure to set up systems to vet and match refugees with sponsors.
Over time, countries could also establish procedures enabling asylum-seekers to apply more easily for labor, student, or family reunification visas.
And Turkish-American Hamdi Ulukaya, founder of Chobani yogurt, has pledged $700 million to support refugees.
In a speech in Königsberg that March, he jeered, “I can only hope and expect that the other world which has felt such deep sympathy for these criminals will be generous enough to transform this pity into practical aid. As far as I am concerned we are ready to place our luxury ships at the disposal of these countries for the transportation of these criminals.”
Many of the countries that refused to take in suffering refugees were themselves, in due course, occupied and brutalized by the Nazis – and desperate for the compassion that they denied the Jews in July 1938.
François Crépeau, the United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, observed in a recent interview that Europe, Australia, and Canada could easily resettle one million Syrian refugees over the next five years, and they could add Eritreans to that list and extend this policy to seven years.
Instead, Europe has preferred to search for scapegoats – and Greece is the latest to be targeted for blame.
That means operating beyond Europe’s borders, as, from the donors’ perspective, it is much less disruptive and expensive to maintain asylum-seekers close to their present locations.
Indeed, the EU should establish or expand programs that allow entry to non-asylum-seekers.
The EU should establish a single European Border Guard and a single Asylum and Migration Agency.
Depression’s Advocates
Instead, Greece’s creditors chose to tighten the screws.
In May 2010, Greece’s GDP had fallen by 4% year on year.
Such reforms are needed to boost long-term growth, the thinking goes, and if that growth does not rapidly emerge, it is because the need for them was even greater than originally thought.
Implementation of the proposed reforms is lagging; there may be legal challenges to the European Stability Mechanism in Germany; and the Netherlands and Finland seem to be backtracking on some parts of the agreement.
Broadly speaking, capital inflows led to real revaluation and a lower domestic savings rate relative to investment in the southern countries, resulting in structural current-account deficits.
The ECB’s provision of liquidity can buy time, but only real adjustment can cure the underlying problem.
High public-debt levels would still have to be reduced to create fiscal space and keep interest rates low enough to restore long-term confidence.
BRUSSELS – Following the escalation of the euro crisis and decisions taken at the European Union’s last summit, especially EU leaders’ commitment to embark on the road “Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union,” it is high time to ask what comes next.
The EU’s leaders have asked Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, to develop, in close collaboration with the presidents of the European Commission, the Eurogroup, and the European Central Bank, a road map to achieve a “Genuine Economic and Monetary Union.”
But it is a risk that must be taken.
But it is probably the only way to keep Europe moving forward.
Where the right is in opposition, such as in Spain and Portugal, it has improved its position.
But those worried about the rise of extremism in Europe should take some heart from the fact that there are many differences of views between these parties.
These new chasms might be the most important long term outcome of the European Parliament elections.
But a proactive, strong Europe capable of determining its own fate will not be in the cards for quite some time.
2) The EU will stagnate.
In the future, close cooperation between Germany and France will more than ever form the old and new center of gravity in a blocked EU.
This formula worked with the Monetary Union.
As the rescue is taking place, the vessel finds that it must also rescue two other, larger boats.
The ECB has already purchased almost a €100 billion of peripheral government bonds, and it is committed to buying a lot more.
Without these other agencies’ help, the ECB’s unprecedented actions will end up being a bridge to nowhere.
Although the endgame is close, it is impossible to predict which alternative will prevail.
This chart shows increasing divergences over the last ten years, with the countries now facing difficulties (Greece, Portugal, and Spain) having lost competitiveness by around 20% relative to Germany.
The adjustment might come about through wage increases in countries with lower labor costs, rather than cuts in countries where costs are too high.
Some of the countries that achieved the highest growth in labor productivity also lost the most competitiveness (e.g. Ireland).
The sharp fiscal retrenchment that has now started throughout southern Europe should contribute further to a sharp deceleration, if not outright fall, in domestic demand there.
Europe’s Conscience Police
Nor did I did introduce the issue of homosexuality into the debate over my appointment.
Indeed, the committee entered in the sphere of moral conscience by stating that anyone who does not adhere to a positive moral evaluation of homosexuality is unfit to serve as a European commissioner.
That implication is intolerable, and it will progressively weaken and divide the EU through a type of semi-official hostility to religious faith.
Russia today openly lays claim to a sphere of interest in its borderlands – in direct contradiction to commitments made under the Helsinki process.
There is no stable solution in sight for Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
Regardless of whether Georgians like or dislike Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvilli, they want to go West, too.
But we need to do so knowing what our strategy is on this key issue.
True, the French had neither the Olympic Games nor a royal celebration this year; but, when it comes to the state of their economies, the two countries are largely in the same boat.
It is perceived as a model of “civility.”
It also remains a model of reconciliation in which people can continue to dream, despite unacceptably high levels of unemployment, particularly among the young.
Critical negotiations between the NCP in the North and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in the South on issues that divide the North and South have stalled.
Commitments regarding increased debt relief, further normalization of relations, and additional aid and investment are possible incentives that European states could put on the table, particularly in the hard push before January 9.
CHISINAU – Three floors of Moldova’s parliament building are a charred ruin.
President Vladimir Voronin later granted the detainees amnesty.
The United States should do more to help bring stability to Moldova.
Moldova is more dependent on the EU than any other former Soviet republic.
At first it was the European Commission that drew criticism for its slowness in making proposals to rally national governments and their policymakers.
The challenge now is for the presidency and the Commission to give fresh political impetus to the EU’s stalled reform drive.
Europe’s increasingly gloomy prospects make these reforms more necessary than ever.
But the main driver is culture, not economics.
A language is not just a systematic means of communicating. It is a sign of identity, culture, and national pride.
But Europe is still far from that point: after more than 60 years of economic integration, a truly European people, with its own identity and language, has yet to emerge.
Europe’s Dangerous Banalities
But the price that was supposedly paid by the Palestinians touched another neuralgic lobe in the European mind.
Moreover, Israel is painfully aware of the many legitimate interests that Europe has in the region.
When the choice alighted on Barack Obama three years ago, the Norwegian Nobel Committee was criticized for honoring someone whose achievements were still to come.
Europe must break the vicious circle linking distressed sovereign borrowers with banks that are obliged, or at least encouraged, to buy their bonds, which in turn provide the funding for bank rescues.
There will also be potentially dangerous consequences for the ECB itself.
The Commission is trying to find ways to protect the rights of the non-eurozone countries.
SÃO PAULO – In a heroic case of finding a silver lining in the bleakest of all situations, the European Union climate commissioner has concluded that the global economic crisis and recession actually provided a lucky break for everyone.
Unfortunately, Europe has done no such thing; if anything, R&amp;D spending has actually declined slightly since then.
Nonetheless, Europe has continued to pursue its quixotic course, even without a global treaty on reducing carbon emissions.
In trying to decipher Asia’s diplomatic future, Europeans are confronted, so to speak, with an “embarrassment of riches.”
The only exception to this, of course, would be a declaration of independence from Taiwan, which the Chinese would consider a casus belli.
In reality, what may threaten the stability of the region, and above all that of China, is not an excess of Chinese ambitions or a failure to democratize, but the Chinese regime’s inability to establish the rule of law.
Without its gradual imposition, an Asian Union could at best remain only a pale and hollow copy of its European model.

It could, for example, provoke the Israelis to dig in their heels, on the grounds that it is part of an effort to delegitimize the Zionist cause.
But these sound reasons for supporting Palestine’s bid probably will not prevent the EU from delivering a split vote, the reverberations of which will not only echo throughout the Arab world, inviting accusations of hypocrisy, but will also hinder European efforts to reset relations with countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
Europe’s leaders now agree on a vision of what the EU should become: an economic and monetary union complemented by a banking union, a fiscal union, and a political union.
Vision aplenty.
The other view is that to proceed with the new policies before the new institutions are in place would be reckless.
At the slight risk of overgeneralization, one can say that the first camp was made up mainly of northern Europeans, while the second was dominated by the south.
Europe thus finds itself in a familiar bind.
And, after the recent EU summit agreed on an “ultima ratio” rescue plan for eurozone countries facing the danger of default, chances are high that it will not materialize.
Despite this bleak picture, Prime Minister George Papandreou’s Socialist government still enjoys support.
Others might follow the Greek example and go into the streets, not out of solidarity but out of frustration with conditions in their home country.
Distrust between EU countries seems widespread.
Of course, in 1950 the Cold War was raging and recovery from World War II concentrated European minds.
At least, this is the way things were and should be.
We embraced each other under the blue flag with its 12 yellow stars.
But they desperately need a new narrative.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel initially proposed the “transfer union,” in which Germany and other strong eurozone economies would transfer funds year after year to Greece and other needy countries, in exchange for the authority to regulate and supervise the recipient countries’ budgets and tax collections.
Although failure to comply would in principle lead to automatic financial penalties, it is difficult to imagine how such failure could be determined in a country like Spain.
During the single currency’s first decade, private investors’ belief in the equality of all eurozone sovereign bonds kept interest rates low in the peripheral countries, even as their governments ran up large deficits and accumulated massive debt.
And it is not an abstract, undefined fear: it is above all the fear of the non-European “other,” perceived by a growing numbers of “white” Europeans as a threat to our European identities and ways of life, if not our physical security and jobs.
Globalization, and the frustration accompanying it, is leading many to a jittery search for self-worth.
By launching a national debate on the issue of identity, Sarkozy risks creating unnecessary boundaries between French citizens – at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons.
BRUSSELS – It is an old debate, but tensions within the euro area have revived it: can a monetary union survive without some form of fiscal federalism?
This was clearly true in the case of the stimulus program launched in 2009, which included federal transfers to the states to sustain state-level fiscal spending. Similarly, when a state such as Michigan is hit by recession in its key economic sector (the auto industry), Washington collects less federal tax but maintains – if not increases – local spending, which partially offsets the shock to state income.
These transfers are significant for poor countries: about €300 per person for Greece and Portugal every year from 2000 to 2006.
But the uproar caused by these decisions reinforces, rather than dispels, doubts.
This may make skeptics the very people European policymakers wanted to convince.
Similarly, European security and intelligence services have pooled resources in a common center for threat analysis in Brussels.
Reducing the risk of terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction equally requires stronger international cooperation.
Javier Solana, the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, will continue to press for results.
Ultimately, the values of liberty and justice are our best defense.
If there is $120 of collateral guaranteeing a $100 bond, the bond is safer, no doubt.
The CDO market, however, was concentrated: six or seven issuers controlled most of the market, and this market ended up representing 50% of the entire revenues to be gained through ratings.
How can a bond guaranteed in large part by countries such as Italy and Spain (likely candidates for a fiscal crisis) provide AAA status to Irish bonds?
Independent of this test, however, Germany seems to have squared the circle: it helped the countries in trouble, without coughing up (for the moment) any euros.
In August 2007, the decision by BNP Paribas to close two of its hedge funds exposed to the subprime sector precipitated a liquidity crisis for all European banks during that summer.
Portugal made a sprint towards the front, but is now falling back a little, with Spain and Italy moving up.
Of course, the can is not in the road; it is in the banking parlors. EU banks are holding sovereign debt that clearly is not worth 100 cents on the euro.
Will it be possible for them to rollover their market funding in these circumstances? Already, the Greeks and the other countries subject to special measures have been shut out of the wholesale markets, and are reliant almost entirely on the European Central Bank.
Europe’s Free Riders
To head off this possibility, the EU created the Stability and Growth Pact: government deficits had to be less than 3% of GDP.
Willem Buiter of the University of Amsterdam and Anne Sibert of the University of London believe that it is the ECB’s willingness to, in effect, accept all euro-zone debt as collateral that has undermined the market’s willingness to be an enforcer of fiscal prudence.
And now, Buiter and Sibert argue convincingly, the ECB is giving the market less scope to reward the thrifty and penalize the profligate than it should.
Many Roma are sent to special schools even though they show no sign of mental disability.
The shooting, by automatic weapon fire, took place in broad daylight in a largely Roma neighborhood, where the grandmother of one of the victims lived.
In 2000, the EU’s executive arm – responding in part to the growing popularity of anti-immigrant and neo-Nazi political parties – enacted the most far-reaching anti-discrimination legislation in the world.
Europe’s High-Risk Gamble
That’s why the interest rate on Greek three-year government debt recently soared past 100% and the yield on ten-year bonds is 22%, implying that a €100 principal payable in ten years is worth less than €14 today.
That could cause their interest rates to spike upward and their national debts to rise rapidly, thus making them effectively insolvent.
Portugal might follow Greece in a sovereign default and in leaving the eurozone.
BERKELEY – The last few weeks have been the most amazing – and important – period of the euro’s 11-year existence.
Those forecasting the demise of the euro were wrong because they misunderstood the politics.
It has an excellent central bank. But it lacks the other elements of a proper monetary union.
Instead, Europe will have to rely on wage flexibility to enhance the competitiveness of its depressed regions.
Emergencies should not be dealt with on an ad hoc basis by 27 finance ministers frantic to reach a solution before the Asian markets open.
Europe\u0027s House Divided
Europe, once the continent of power clashes and balances, became a community of law where big and small follow common rules to reach common decisions.
To save it, the bigger ones will indeed have to take the lead.
Bringing in Britain is an admission of that fact.
The standard way to buffer the effects of austerity is to marry domestic cuts to devaluation of the currency.
So, if internal devaluation is to work, the value of debts, where they already represent a heavy burden, must be reduced.
But internal devaluation requires debt restructuring.
When Latin American debt was restructured in the 1980’s under the Brady Plan, these “sweeteners” were provided by the United States Treasury.
All of this requires leadership.
The Lisbon Agenda turned out to be a joke.
That doctrine of hard discipline was abolished in a coup in May 2010, when it was claimed that the world would collapse unless Germany opened its purse.
A year ago, it vowed to stop accepting BBB- rated government securities as collateral for its monetary operations.
But politicians are averse to academic advice. All too often, they prefer bad jokes – until the last laugh is on them.
That is why France recently received an Algerian ex-detainee.
Therefore, the review of detention, trial, transfer, and interrogation policies is of utmost importance.
In many EU member states, criminal law has been strengthened and is being used to prevent attacks.
Faced with a country whose leader is bent on acquiring nuclear weapons, the EU’s leaders are simply dithering, fearing that the fire next door in Iraq could somehow spread.
MAD simply won’t work for a mad man who is guided by quasi-messianic certitude.
As an organ of the EU, the EIB should be pursuing an ethical investment policy.
Despite repression, Iran’s civil society is well developed and sophisticated.
When the euro was created, its architects were well aware that no monetary union in history had succeeded without the backing of a political union.
Most, indeed, implicitly assume a massive transfer of almost all functions of government from member states to the federal center, and thus the creation of a “European superstate.”
It would be well worth it: a critical mass of €600-700 billion would make macroeconomic stabilization and re-distribution possible when necessary, without the establishment of ad hoc mechanisms or, worse, the publicity and attention surrounding summit after summit called to decide the next package of aid to financially distressed countries.
In this sense, the looming prospect of a full-blown Italian debt crisis could prove beneficial by focusing European minds.
The first step towards a narrative capable of replacing earlier rallying cries like “no more war” and “a single market and a single currency” is to set out Europe’s interests.
That is not good enough.
It may be that the coming years will somehow see solutions to the EU’s lost competitiveness, poor innovation, shrinking manufacturing, inadequate education, and growing labor shortages.
But there is little sign of governments taking advantage of this opportunity.
The introduction of the euro by a number of them – Estonia is likely to follow shortly – has also been a remarkable success story.
Economic success or failure in the decade up to 2020 will be another critical element in whether we are seen as a model or as a museum.
That is why it truly has the potential to be a model not only for its own region, but also globally.
And, with Israeli jet fighters still controlling the airspace, Egypt’s capital and its major population centers were greatly exposed.
European citizens – particularly in peripheral economies such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain – are anxious.
Europe’s economic peace remains elusive for a simple reason: governments have still not found a way to generate the trifecta of growth, employment, and financial stability.
Indeed, this is one of the factors that contributed to Moody’s decision – following Standard &amp; Poor’s – to strip France of its AAA credit rating.
Like Egypt’s war of attrition, the eurozone’s underlying economic, financial, and social ferment continues.
Under both systems, those who accept responsibility to take military action also take on the lion’s share of the financial burden.
For NATO to work properly, its members must be prepared not only to supply troops and equipment for NATO-led military operations, but also to fund and sustain these operations until missions are completed.
Yet fixing the problem is easier said than done.
But, apart from the common costs of an operation (usually less than 8% of the total), the ESDP uses the same funding method as NATO, which means that the bulk of the money for both ESDP and NATO-led military operations comes out of the same defense pot in each member state.
Europe’s Misguided “Growth Pessimists”
But European inflation is growing at approximately the same rate.
The German Chancellor has been lucky.
Premature inflationary pressures are a prime reason that both ECB presidents, the late Wim Duisenberg and now Jean-Claude Trichet, have consistently pressed for structural reform in their press conferences and speeches.
Today, however, the eurozone’s attention has shifted to growth.
But the real question is: what can Europe do to create growth? The honest answer is: rather little.
In fact, more infrastructure investment would actually make most sense in Germany, where infrastructure spending has been anemic (only 1.6 % of GDP, or half the rate of Spain) for almost a decade.
Deep service-sector reforms in Germany would also help to unlock the country’s productivity potential and open its market to services exports from southern Europe.
East Asia’s regional powers operate almost without any multilateral framework, a state of affairs comparable to that of Europe toward the end of the nineteenth century.
At the center of this policy is Ukraine, the linchpin of Europe’s post-Soviet order.
Otherwise, both sides will find themselves among the losers.
THE HAGUE – European heads of state, energy ministers, and the European Union are actively debating climate and energy policy at a series of summits in the coming weeks.
Creative destruction, the process of innovation described by the economist Joseph Schumpeter, will be at work.
Furthermore, a 30% reduction by 2020 is well within reach, as a 17.3% reduction against the 1990 baseline was already achieved by 2009;
But if it is so easy, why is it not getting done? A firmer commitment to energy efficiency, particularly the rollout of large-scale programs to retrofit the existing building stock, would create large numbers of jobs, expand the market for energy-efficiency products and technologies, and reduce energy demand;
But, beyond the celebrations of the most recent enlargement round and preparations for the next one, it is time to ask what effect the enlarged EU will have on world affairs?
In 1945, the Germans and the French liked each other about as much as Serbs and Bosnians do today.
The other element of historic significance is the unified internal market of the extended European Union.
The historical and strategic sensibilities of all the countries assembled in the new Europe are so different that they cannot have a common foreign policy.
The formal end of America's occupation of Iraq, with sovereignty transferred to an Iraqi government, provides Europe with a chance to play a serious role in determining the future of that vital nation.
Those who believe that "preventive" war is the worst possible medicine should show that there has always been an alternative based on the principles and regional options that led them to oppose the military intervention in Iraq. That intervention exemplifies the failure of the "wounded beast" theory of diplomacy, according to which the US could do anything after the terrorist attacks of 2001, with the ends justifying the means.
Only this will ensure the support of the main Iraqi political forces.
Finally, as stated repeatedly since the start of the war, there can be no success in Iraq without a strong Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative.
This form of political racketeering may win elections, but it sabotages any opportunity to experience, or to perceive, politics as a process that can contribute to global development.
Further EU enlargement is undoubtedly in Turkey’s interest, and in Europe’s, too.
Indeed, he may not even object to ruining the EU’s entire legislative engine by granting national parliaments a veto.
The costs of default depend on how messy things become when payments stop. What are the legal difficulties?
For example, Greece’s debt stock, including required bridge financing under the IMF program, should peak at around 150% of GNP in 2014; much of this debt is external. If a country can support debt totaling 80% of GNP (a rough but reasonable rule of thumb), then we need approximately 50% “haircuts” on this existing and forthcoming debt (reducing it to 75% of its nominal value).
Spain’s financial exposure to Portugal and its housing-led recession don’t help matters.
So the ECB should decide which countries are inherently solvent, and then protect them against a liquidity squeeze with new, scaled-up interventions that do target interest rates.
Defense cuts are also happening at a time when Europe, for the first time in modern history, has been overtaken by Asia in terms of total defense spending.
Greater “burden-sharing” was a rote American demand.
Still, French-British cooperation if it does take on real substance could be an inspiration to others, though the challenges to making the agreement viable are formidable.
Europeans may have to embrace new modes of cooperation among their national armed forces in order to put them to effective use.
These banks’ potentially troubled assets include, of course, bonds issued by Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and other eurozone countries whose fiscal prospects are now being marked down by financial markets – but that until recently were regarded as “zero risk” by the relevant authorities.
To be sure, the European Central Bank could cut interest rates further (widening the gap between banks’ borrowing costs and what they charge for loans is a classic way to help them earn profits and recapitalize themselves).
Equity capital will increase relative to assets – but, under current policies, it will increase because banks reduce their assets, not because they raise capital.
But after inflation succumbed, unemployment did not fall – or not by much.
Of course, these fears are accompanied by the hope that structural reforms and monetary expansion work in harmony, boosting employment and output without raising inflation by much.
I think that Germany would be better off in a decade under more neo-liberal policies.
The ECB should not try to balance inflation in the south and east with deflation in the north in order to hit artificial continent-wide targets.
This pattern began at the start of the 'European project' over half a century ago.
Indeed, even under the Constitutional Treaty, all states know that their partners have the express right to withdraw if they should ever become sufficiently disenchanted or come to look upon the EU as a bad bargain.
After the Treaty is signed, it will go before the national parliaments for approval.
The EU's objectives are precisely those that countries are unable to achieve on their own, for example, a stronger economy and greater security.
Many people despair of finding their way through the maze of current EU treaties and their numerous amendments.
The Treaty introduces major improvements here, enabling us to work together more effectively to achieve our aims.
Peace, security, and prosperity are as vulnerable as they are valuable. This Treaty makes them stronger.
Part of the confusion lies in Putin’s skillful political positioning.
In the Caucasus and Central Asia, the Kremlin has effectively shut the EU out of regions where it has an interest in promoting political reform, resolving conflicts, and forging energy partnerships.
The first approach risks giving Russia easy access to all the benefits of cooperation with the EU, without insisting that Russia abide by stable rules.
So long as the EU continues to sway between integration and containment, it will continue to appear to the Kremlin as weak and directionless.
The Treaties of Maastricht (1992) and Amsterdam (1997) created a new organizational structure for the EU and laid the foundations for political institutions equal to Europe’s economic power.
Europe is a peculiar combination of geography and history, but the EU’s boundaries – and thus the prospects for its further enlargement – are determined as much by its capacity to integrate candidate countries as by these countries’ own adaptive abilities.
Such questions could be the topic of a consultative referendum held simultaneously in all member states.
Europe’s Next Steps
But even if America has lost some of its attractive “soft power,” Europe’s post-industrial publics are not willing to pay the price – a doubling or tripling of defense spending as a share of GDP – to invest in the military power that would be required to balance its hard power.
This hardly fits the description of a uni-polar world.
The loss of soft power implied by rejection of further enlargement would be a setback for Europe, the Balkans, and international stability.
Such a practical, effective EU may not reach the lofty rhetorical aspirations beloved by politicians, but it will not be moribund.
But it is impossible to escape the feeling that Western Europeans and the Americans were eager to exchange their strategic Cold War perspective for one focused narrowly on trade and commerce.
However, this division was far from absolute, and in the nineteenth century, Western Europe, Central Europe, and Russia were closely linked as a united cultural and economic space, which grew and developed despite religious diversity and political upheavals.
Human rights, openness, and democratic values should be genuinely shared as a means to achieve a true partnership.
Scandinavian capitalism has been traditionally more humane, and social injustice, though it exists, is much less destructive than in southern Europe, for example.
Scandinavian countries have their share of problems, such as Denmark’s significant xenophobic extreme right and Norway’s occasional bouts of provincial puritanism.
In China, capitalism prospers without democracy.
There is more rigor and openness under the Northern Lights, and this is precisely the combination we need, with its mixture of modesty towards others and ambition towards ourselves.
Unless something very wrong happens, a new cold war is not about to start.
I thank you for it. But now I do not need your symbolic votes; I need your concrete support.
Paradoxically, too, the “greening” of America – an America that discovers late but with passion its responsibility for the planet’s survival – may lead to a competitive transatlantic race for first prize in ecological good behavior.
One country’s failures can threaten the entire European economy, and can call into question the fruits of 60 years of integration.
The growth pact can be properly financed by new sources of revenue, such as a financial-transaction tax and joint project bonds for infrastructure investment, or by curbing tax evasion and tax fraud and eliminating tax havens, as well as by more efficient and intelligent use of structural funds.
Our responsibility here is twofold: to put growth back on track, but also to respond immediately to the human tragedy that has hit our youth.
The EU budget is an investment vehicle that boosts economic growth and creates jobs.
Europe can still emerge stronger from its current economic woes.&nbsp;The EU is changing direction at last, and Europe’s leaders will find an energetic partner in the European Parliament.
The number of seats won by the socialists and centre-right parties is likely to influence the make-up of the next European Commission – and thus the EU’s political agenda until 2014.
Unfortunately, however, the European Parliament is fairly inept at selling itself to public opinion.
Europe’s Power to Lead
The picture for Europe, however, is not as bleak as pessimists assume.
On this board, power is chaotically distributed among non-state actors, and it makes no sense to call this world either uni-polar or multipolar.
Unlike India, China has not solved the problem of political participation.
More open trade, economic growth, education, development of civil society institutions, and gradual increases in political participation might help strengthen the mainstream over time, as could the way Muslims are treated in Europe and the US. Equally important will be whether Western policies toward the Middle East satisfy mainstream Muslims or reinforce the radicals’ narrative of a war against Islam.
The vast majority of us live in Third World conditions – denied access to adequate housing, health care, and education.
Education is the only way out of the ghetto for many Roma.
The government allowed employment discrimination to go unchecked, leaving the majority of Roma without jobs, and communities were plunged deeper into poverty.
This is not a unique situation.
The Court’s decision allows this brutal and systematic violation of fundamental rights to continue.
Europe has capitalized on globalization to consolidate its position as the world’s major economy and trader.
The economic crisis has made progress in the negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda in the World Trade Organization even more important.
The EU has multilateralism in its DNA.
The EU is facing up to its responsibilities as a major source of past emissions.
The Lisbon Treaty allows us to achieve a greater coherence and gives us a much greater capacity to act.
The most obvious and imminent flashpoint is Kosovo.
This owes much to the humiliations that Russia suffered when the end of communism forced its economy to its knees, and to Western short-sightedness about Russia’s fundamental strengths and resilience.
Russian leaders may have misinterpreted as a sign of weakness Europe’s representation at last month’s EU-Russia summit by two Portuguese politicians – European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and Prime Minister Jose Socrates, whose government currently holds the revolving EU presidency.
What the EU learned from the subsequent four years of Balkan disasters under its management is now being tested by another major turning point and potential crisis – when and how Kosovo is to become independent.
He has strengthened the position of many in Europe and elsewhere who are skeptical of challenging a country’s territorial integrity or who still claim to believe in a negotiated settlement.
Realizing Ahtisaari’s proposal will depend on EU solidarity and persistence, coupled with strong American support, to manage the vicissitudes of UN debate, lobby skeptical non-permanent Security Council members, such as Indonesia and South Africa, and persuade Russia to abstain rather than exercise its veto.
The Maastricht Treaty established a monetary union, but the political union that is an indispensable precondition for the common currency’s success remained a mere promise.
Today, Europe – or, more precisely, the eurozone – faces an almost identical situation, except that the historical conditions for further integration are much more complex and difficult than they were in post-independence America.
Indeed, the crisis is beginning to erode the very foundations – the Franco-German and transatlantic partnerships – of a post-war European order that has ensured a period of peace and prosperity without precedent in the history of the continent.
While this rivalry will have a military component, as evidenced by China’s enormous military buildup, it will manifest itself primarily in terms of economic, political, and normative spheres of influence.
Repairing them requires nothing less than pressing ahead, at long last, toward a strong, united Europe.
Indeed, the recession will worsen throughout this year, for many reasons.
Elections in Greece – where the recession is turning into a depression – may give 40-50% of the popular vote to parties that favor immediate default and exit from the eurozone.
That is why interest-rate spreads in the eurozone periphery are widening again now.
But those “no” votes have obscured the fact that 18 of the EU’s 27 member states have ratified the treaty.
It is also obvious that member states cannot solve these problems alone, but only through coordinated EU action and common policies. But to achieve these results, and thereby convince our citizens of the EU’s value, Europe’s decision-making capacity must be strengthened and democratized.
It is no exaggeration to say that a large majority of member states and their citizens has already expressed its wish for this vision of the EU by voting for the Constitutional Treaty.
By all means, let us try to preserve the solidarity of all 27 EU states.
The specter of a full-blown crisis was starting to haunt markets.
Issuing Eurobonds would mean replacing the current eurozone strategy of “every man for himself” with one based on the principle “all for one and one for all,” which would enable joint borrowing by euro countries.
In the short term, bolstering European governance by appointing EU President Hermann Van Rompuy as a permanent chairman of the eurozone conveys a signal about the zone’s cohesion that is designed to calm markets and support the strategy adopted on July 21.
What we can say with certainty is that Draghi’s remarks and the reaction they evoked demonstrate that the fundamental problems of the eurozone are not primarily financial or economic; they are political, psychological, and institutional.
The limitations of this approach have now been revealed.
My impression is that German public and political opinion is beginning to recognize the economic devastation for Europe and Germany implied by a euro breakup.
“Nein” merely brings calamity closer.
In June, a NATO summit will discuss prospects for Ukraine's entry into the alliance.
The parliamentary victory of the opposition also forced the reluctant authorities to declare Ukraine's readiness to enter NATO and the EU.
Since then, it has participated in UN and NATO peace missions, and it has settled its borders with all its neighbors.
But this should not make us lose sight of other challenges.
Europe is aging and will lose 20 million people by 2030, while the southern Mediterranean has a dynamic young population that desperately needs job opportunities.
At the same time, jobs mobility should replace unwanted migration.
Asia revolves around ASEAN, and the Americas around NAFTA and Mercosur. Europe, too, needs to help organize a large hemispheric region.
But the tough question that has to be asked is whether the crisis could lead to the unraveling of European integration.
On the contrary, it should finalize further enlargement: the economic crisis has clearly demonstrated that the EU cannot afford black holes on the map of Europe.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development therefore encourages all new EU member states that have not yet started doing so to draft credible and convincing plans for euro-zone admission.
This has created jobs in central and eastern Europe, while boosting prosperity in the older member states.
There is, of course, a little provocation and a lot of irony in these remarks.
This disinterest in Europe is not recent, but it has deepened over recent years.
From Libya to Mali, France and Britain are largely seen as the extended arm of an America that is increasingly reticent to commit its own troops – or even weapons. Similarly, for the US government, as for China’s leaders, Germany has become Europe’s key economic actor.
In the immediate aftermath of Snowden’s revelations, the French satirical newspaper Le Canard Enchaîné ran a headline that said: “For once, Obama is interested in what we are saying.”
Indeed, lending to governments and banks in the European periphery represents the European equivalent of subprime lending in the US (which was also concentrated in a few sunshine states).
This is equivalent to $700 billion, the same magnitude as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) instituted in late 2008 to keep US financial markets from collapsing.
By contrast, European authorities refuse to test the scenario that the market currently fears most: losses on loans to banks and governments on Europe’s periphery.
But this should compel a strong recapitalization program – not weak stress tests.
Friedman and Schwartz are generally seen as reproving the Fed for failing to react swiftly to successive waves of bank failures, first in late 1930 and then again in 1931 and 1933.
It could agree to swift bank recapitalization, a banking license for the European Stability Mechanism, and a more expansionary ECB policy.
Hamilton made the case that the federal government should assume responsibility for their liabilities stemming from the costs of financing the war.
Europe is dangerously close to its financial Sarajevo.
So far, nearly 400,000 people have filled refugee camps in Tunisia and Egypt, and an estimated 20,000 have reached Italy’s shores.
Policies that help train the next generation of North Africans, and allow them to circulate more freely between Europe and their home countries, are a much smarter solution than the current approach, which sustains illegal migration without meeting Europe's labor needs. This is an argument not for more migration, but for better migration – well thought out and planned.
Responding to the challenges and opportunities of this moment demands the creation of strong partnerships among states, international institutions, and non-governmental actors.
WASHINGTON, DC – Today, the European project is shaking.
The EU has created a channel of communication with Turkey on political matters.
I believe that Putin understands this, which is an important fact for future diplomacy.
I was involved in the negotiations that helped to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Orange Revolution of 2004-2005.
Today’s crisis started in rich industrial countries – not only with sub-prime mortgages in the United States, but also with mismanagement of banks and public debt in Europe.
In August 1982, Mexico shocked the world by declaring that it was unable to service its debt.
It involved a combination of three elements: immediate international assistance, through the International Monetary Fund; severe domestic retrenchment, enforced by the highly unpopular conditionality of IMF programs; and additional financing provided by the banks.
The Franco-German initiative unveiled at Deauville in early November, which would require some possible measure of restructuring for debt issued after 2013, tried to avoid the immediate shock of a haircut.
Severe economic distress and political pressure are buffeting relationships among citizens, sovereign states, and supranational institutions such as the European Central Bank.
Disagreement among and between heads of state and the ECB over the Bank’s purchases of distressed sovereign debt have only added to the uncertainty.
But the banks are profitable ongoing enterprises in the current low-interest-rate environment, because they typically engage in short-term borrowing and longer-term lending at higher rates, with leverage.
Scaled to today’s economy, assets worth $1.25 trillion were sold off, with 80% of the value recovered.
BERKELEY – Europe is now moving ineluctably toward a bailout for Greece. There will be emergency financing.
Portugal and Italy are little better.
This heightens uncertainty.
People would understand that he was acting in the interest of the state as well as the country.
They oppose anything that smacks of European political integration.
The Greek crisis could be the Trojan horse that leads Europe toward deeper political integration.
Despite the understandable concerns of Finns, Poles, and others in Central and Eastern Europe, the relationship with Russia should be the easier of the two to manage.
Second, whether one thinks of Al Qaeda’s terrorism or the presence of Western armies in Iraq and Afghanistan, Europe and the Islamic world have demonstrated a continuing willingness to deal violently with each other.
Unlike his two predecessors, Obama has had the courage to target the Israel-Palestine problem, the intractable seat of the infection, from the beginning of his presidency.
It has currently put on hold a deepened economic relationship with Israel: if Israel’s government continues to refuse to stop its colonization of the West Bank, Europeans should make clear that, as Israel’s most important export market, they have tougher options at hand.
We saw this most visibly in the person of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who fortunately has been kicked to the sidelines of the political scene. But even the most stalwart European leaders have lost their followers’ trust by baldly saying one thing today and the opposite tomorrow.
The Greek version of this dilemma, in which no one pays taxes because no one else pays taxes, is particularly stark.
EU member states need to rebuild their trust in one another. And European countries facing the need for wrenching structural reforms need to restore social trust at home.
At the time, Europe immediately understood the challenge and reacted effectively.
Europe and Russia meet in Ukraine, and its fate will not only be a crucial factor in defining European security, but will also play a substantial role in future European-Russian relations.
Only if Germany and Poland, together with the smaller eastern member states, jointly advocate such an “eastern” and neighborhood policy towards Ukraine, will EU policy as a whole receive the necessary power and perseverance.
Not only has German resurgence raised overall growth in Europe, but it has also made growth less evenly balanced throughout the euro zone.
The currencies of the reform laggards would have depreciated against that of Germany, and there might have been a supportive cut in interest rates as well.
Chronic stagnation is too high a price to pay for adopting the euro.
The ECB President made it clear he will do his duty whatever the political pressure.
Europe’s Vision Deficit
And right-wing populism has become an electoral force to be reckoned with in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
Consider the euro: no head of state or government has so far been able to present a coherent defense of the eurozone to counter the pervasive unease that now exists towards the common currency.
The truth that politicians (David Cameron’s UK government excluded, at least for now) are reluctant to admit is that Western Europe’s current morass is distinct from the global US-made downturn.
Europe’s Vision Free Leadership
But it is not yet clear, whatever the Lisbon Treaty says, that Ashton has full control of either the EU external budget or of appointments to the new diplomatic service.
The EU needs common defense procurement and harmonization to acquire the helicopters, transport aircraft, battlefield communications equipment, and surveillance drones that are necessary for twenty-first-century operations.
The greatest success of Europe’s external policy has been EU enlargement.
Unfortunately, van Rompuy, an author and poet, has spoken out against Turkish membership in far cruder terms than one would expect from a gentle haiku writer.
Europe’s Vital French Connection
An active France can play a bridging role, leveraging its strong relationship with Germany (a friendship that is a pillar of the EU) and its proximity and cultural affinities to the Mediterranean.
The reforms should also introduce much greater individual choice, permitting solutions to retirement, education, health, and lifestyle issues that can be more easily tailored to citizens’ specific circumstances and needs.
Europe needs a renewed vision and effective policies to realize that vision.
Indeed, she had no choice but to concede and agree to far-reaching changes to the EU’s new fiscal compact that will ease refinancing of the crisis countries and their banks.
Instead, it is a full-blown defeat for Germany, linked to its firm denial that German policy has sharply reduced the country’s influence in the EU.
And, while that would jeopardize Germany’s own interests, practical political action is not always rational, particularly in times of serious crisis.
He was wrong.
Since the eruption of the European crisis in 2009, the EU and the eurozone have experienced massive, unprecedented changes.
The depression will continue, dimming prospects for economic growth throughout the EU and the eurozone.
Given this, Europe’s condition is quite obviously far from being stabilized, despite some leading Europeans’ recent statements suggesting otherwise.
(The wealthy also remain largely in control of the media, the public discourse, and cross-border capital flows.)
This is clearly not sustainable – a point that former Director of the International Monetary Fund's Europe Department Reza Moghadam recognized when he recently called for writing off half of Greece's debt, provided an agreement can be reached on credible growth-enhancing structural reforms.
The persistent tendency to pay lip service to social sustainability, while implementing economic programs focused on unrelenting austerity, is a leading cause of political instability in Europe.
Policymakers must direct just as much effort and resources toward realizing social sustainability as they do toward getting the Basel III financial reforms right.
Worse, informed Americans see anti-Semitism running rampant in Europe and xenophobic political parties on the march in country after country.
"I asked French and German leaders, but never received any credible answer."
So American eyes are turning elsewhere: to China with its 1.3 billion people and an economy growing at 8-10%, year in and year out, and to India, with its 1.1 billion people and 6% annual growth.
It is, however, no more unfair than how America is regularly portrayed in Europe's media these days.
The psychology behind the Tea Party in the United States and the anti-immigrant parties in Europe is similar, even if their policies vary.
Nativism is on the rise all over the Western world, and Wilders, in particular, is a popular speaker at right-wing anti-Muslim gatherings in the US, Britain, and Germany.
As long as this is so, why not give them real political responsibility? They would then not only have to prove their competence, but also moderate their attitudes.
It will no longer do merely to warn against racism, or promote multiculturalism.
One lesson is that unity is not an option; it is a condition sine qua non of the EU’s economic prosperity and political relevance.
The Commission has been equally firm in demanding both.
That thinking – which needs to be reaffirmed and politically supported – underpinned our active trade agenda.
Credibly delivering on important EU-level reforms enabled Europe to put the most existential phase of the crisis behind it.
We must not relax these efforts.
But the main reason is surely that Turkey, a mostly Muslim country, governed by a Muslim party, is viewed as too foreign.
But more and more Europeans are disillusioned with the Union.
Minorities do well in empires, especially benevolent empires.
Turkey is in a good position to guide other Muslim countries in a more liberal-democratic direction.
Such a process cannot be forced on people.
After all, European voters are in no mood to transfer more powers to Brussels.
But before delving into institutional issues – a favorite topic of EU veterans – one should consider what problem the capital-markets union is supposed to solve.
Promoting a pan-European private placement market might help, as would aligning standards for covered bonds.
What began as a slogan may turn out to be helpful.
Perhaps that should come as no surprise, given that nearly 5% of US investment is spent on ICT, compared to 2% in Europe.
To benefit fully from the Internet, the EU should avoid favoring local businesses over global competitors, and all investment should be welcome, whether it comes from Stockholm, Seoul, or San Francisco.
Meanwhile, protesters across Europe have called for a clampdown on Uber’s ride-sharing service and restrictions on Airbnb’s apartment-sharing service, and the French Senate is considering “search neutrality” obligations.
BRUSSELS – The new European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker is off to a rocky start.
The Stability and Growth Pact prescribes an annual improvement of at least 0.5 % of GDP.
But the Commission, not fiscally louche member countries, should be the one to decide that.
It cannot avoid taking sides by insisting publicly on austerity rules but then acquiescing when member states break them.
Back in the 1990’s, EU officials, prompted by Spain, Italy, and France, began to shape a Mediterranean strategy to stimulate trade and investment in the Arab world.
Indeed, Europe has much to offer the Arab world as it emerges from its political and economic stagnation, but it needs to do so loudly and clearly under the banner of EU leadership.
But the EU can make a much more positive and important contribution to the Arab awakening by launching an economic strategy along the lines laid out by Italy’s foreign minister, Franco Frattini, and Britain’s deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg.
Nevertheless, the living conditions of many Roma remain appalling.
A difference in treatment is not discriminatory in itself.
The statistics showing the enormous proportion of Roma children in those schools are hard to ignore, and the suspicion of discrimination is difficult to avoid.
DUBLIN – One of the top priorities established by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker ahead of his election last summer was the creation of a European energy union.
Its implementation would allow Europe to introduce a free-trade zone for renewable energy, reducing the need for storage and excess capacity to back up variable power supplies.

The Baltic states are also planning their own offshore grid.
Europe’s Energy Essentials
Though the EU as a whole maintains a balanced energy mix, with supply divided relatively evenly among gas, coal, oil, renewables, and nuclear generation, individual countries are often excessively dependent on a single source and, more dangerously, a single supplier: Russia.
The problem is that EU leaders have yet to define a compelling and effective strategy for building it.
The EU cannot afford to isolate itself, or misunderstand the geopolitical forces at play, yet again.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent threat to aim missiles at Ukraine highlights what is at stake in that debate’s outcome.
But they were small and contiguous to the EU.
Ukraine needs the discipline of the accession process – and thus the promise of EU membership – if reforms are to be implemented effectively.
That would strengthen Russia’s position in Ukraine, where the Kremlin constantly encourages a return to Slavic roots and warns against flirting with a West that doesn’t want it.
At stake in the debate about EU enlargement into the post-Soviet east is whether Western values will take root in those countries or whether they will drift into a gray zone from which they will sooner or later challenge the values and democratic ways of “Europe.”
Getting agreement over anything is difficult for a European Union of 27 members.
Agreement from the Arab League was vital, as was securing a vote in the United Nations Security Council.
Europe is not a monolith, but in many areas it can still act coherently, even without complete agreement.
Europe at War
As a result, the mere threat of military action may be sufficient to bring about Ukraine’s economic collapse.
And about 30% of the recently elected European Parliament ran on anti-European platforms.
European economies, including Germany, are suffering, as the sanctions’ depressive impact aggravates the recessionary and deflationary forces that are already at work.
But its enemies – not only Putin’s Russia, but also its own bureaucracy and financial oligarchy – are formidable, and it cannot defeat them alone.
With the United States an increasingly reluctant world policeman as it reconsiders, reduces, and realigns its strategic commitments, European countries – especially the United Kingdom and France, given Germany’s retreat from military participation – will have to bear principal responsibility for dealing with African security issues.
Indeed, whatever the role of bilateral cooperation, the only supranational organization capable of sustained combat operations is NATO. That umbrella can provide a basis for US support behind European leadership, as it did in Libya.
Europe needs to take the lead, as it did in Mali and Libya.
Some, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, claim that the conflicts generating these refugees rage only in Arab countries that are being bombed by the West.
Second, the minority who do choose Germany, France, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, or Hungary are not enemies who have come to destroy us or even to sponge off of European taxpayers.
But, for most Europeans, these people are little more than statistics, just as the women and men who have survived the journey remain unidentified and indistinguishable, a threatening anonymous mass.
In Paris, he found a low-skill job and had children and grandchildren.
If anything, growing inequality – exacerbated by years of crisis – is making the problem worse.
More fundamentally, such solutions require abandoning the false dichotomy of liberty and security.
These groups take advantage of unruly environments and weak or collapsing institutions to gain a territorial foothold.
LONDON – As Europe’s financial crisis goes from acute to chronic, the dispute over who will bear the costs of resolving it is fueling the emergence of a new generation of political movements. In the so-called periphery, political upstarts promise citizens an alternative to austerity.
And, during its first decade, the euro ostensibly delivered. Just as cheap mortgage financing papered over the cracks of growing income inequality in the United States, cheap capital from the north accelerated Europe’s apparent economic convergence.
Political revolutions rarely arise out of brief periods of acute crisis. Rather, they follow one or more generations of chronic decline, when fear of economic loss gives way to targeted anger, and charismatic voices surface to orchestrate the response.
If they wait too long, the old walls will be restored and the euro’s guardians will be left out in the cold.

Immigrants from Algeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan, or Turkey will, in the course of a generation or two, become European in outlook and politics.
The essential elements of modern European political life – individual rights and duties, and the accountability of government to the governed – are lacking, particularly in the Arab Middle East.
Despite horrific twentieth-century backsliding in Europe, secularism has served to blunt the edge of bigotry, because secular reasoning, unlike divine revelation, is never conclusive.
European Social Democracy’s Powerless Power
But it is the economic slowdown that renders all developed countries less resistant to the financial shocks resulting from the sub-prime problem and from the mixed loan packages that are then used to dilute the risks attached to sub-prime debt.
Simply put, deregulation, privatization, reduced public services, and refocusing corporate management on earnings – all this suits too many people.
The case of Spain – where a competent and respected government is bearing the full brunt of a financial crisis that began elsewhere – is identical.
Hundreds of thousands were killed, and millions of Syrians have fled, with most living in camps in Jordan, Lebanon, or Turkey for years, in appalling conditions and with no hope of improvement.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s call for European solidarity went unheeded.
The EU will be able to address the challenge – and seize the opportunity – of integrating the newcomers only together and in the spirit of European solidarity.
To be sure, there is a risk that the refugee crisis will strengthen nationalist and populist parties in EU member states.
A lost half-decade is quickly turning into a whole one.
The current mess stems partly from adherence to a long-discredited belief in well-functioning markets without imperfections of information and competition.
But the critics have been right about one thing: unless the structure of the eurozone is reformed, and austerity reversed, Europe will not recover.
Youth unemployment is over 50%.
E Pluribus Europe?
Whereas Merkel declared forcefully that Islam was also a religion of Germany, some in Eastern Europe have declared that they will welcome only a small number of refugees – and only if they are Christian.
In fact, when it comes to EU cohesion, more cleavages are probably better than a single divide.
And Germany, the Scandinavian countries, and the UK may be at the forefront of the fight against climate change.
In Brussels, which was semi-deserted and in lockdown, owing to the risk of terrorist attacks, the European Union institutions have yet to devise a unified strategy to manage the influx of migrants and refugees, much less address the instability and violence in the EU’s immediate neighborhood.
But of all the problems Europe faces, it is the migration crisis that could become existential.
Even with an unlikely wall around Europe, many would find a way in – and some would terrorize Europe for decades to come.
A cyclical recovery is underway, supported by monetary easing for years to come and increasingly flexible fiscal rules.
Europe’s Last Straw?
But Russian attacks on groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime are exacerbating instability in large swaths of the country, driving even more desperate people to seek shelter in Europe.
Too large a crisis – or too many crises at once – threatens to overwhelm the EU’s capacity to respond, ultimately leading to breakdown.
Europe needs to recover the mentality of 1989, when the movement of large numbers of people across borders – initially, the Hungarian-Austrian frontier – prompted reform and openness, rather than a silo mentality.
Now, they are about to make the same mistake in Ukraine, with even more devastating potential consequences.
Ukrainians must perceive that the pain of adjustment is being shared fairly, which means that the country’s oligarchs must become subject, at long last, to the rule of law. But, given that a free, stable, and prosperous Ukraine is very much in Europe’s strategic interest, the EU’s member governments should also share the burden of financing reform.
Plan B in Ukraine is surely not more reform, but less of it – and probably the kind of reckless economic populism that Latin America has witnessed in recent years, from Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela to Néstor and Cristina Kirchner’s neo-Peronist Argentina.
Europe’s leaders cannot decide if the eurozone is a federation akin to the United States or a group of independent states.
Similarly, the IMF is not expected to help India – whose per capita GDP is less than a tenth of eurozone levels – to finance the poverty-stricken states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
Just as it is the responsibility of creditor regions in the world’s other currency unions to support the debtor regions (which they do through a variety of means), it is up to the eurozone’s creditor regions to underpin its debtor regions’ solvency.
The deal has caused a split in Syriza, Greece’s leftist governing party; opened a rift between Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and her uncompromisingly tough finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble; and spurred an effort by France to reassert itself within the Franco-German axis that has always been the “motor” of European integration.
Yet, however complicated the blame game, some lessons can be drawn to guide future policy.
The alternative is to embrace a “transfer union” that ensures a better balance between solidarity and responsibility.
A special Assembly of the European Parliament, comprising the eurozone members, should have powers – on the model of a national parliament – to legislate and control the executive.
The effective renunciation of the fiscal compact by Valls and Renzi suggests that these ratios will rise even further in the coming years.
The best example of the liability model is the United States.
For Europe’s leaders, the withdrawal by France and Italy from the fiscal compact should serve as a clear sign that the mutualization model is not working for the eurozone, either.
Perhaps capital expenditures were overly ambitious, but they triggered rapid export growth, and more than 2,000 jobs were created in the small town of Pirot to manufacture boots for European fishermen and New York City firemen, as well as technical rubber products.
After all, excessive and chaotic deleveraging by lenders to emerging Europe – and the ensuing credit crunch – would destabilize this economically and institutionally fragile region.
Furthermore, collateral – especially real-estate assets – will continue to be downgraded.
The European Investment Bank, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have agreed on a new Joint Action Plan, including investment totaling €30 billion ($39 billion) over the next two years, as well as policy advice, to support economic recovery and sustained growth in the region.
Ketika hari perhitungan datang di musim panas ini, para pemimpin di Tiongkok mengeluarkan $200 miliar yang merupakan cadangan devisa yang diperoleh dengan susah payah seolah-olah berperan sebagai Knut yang Agung berupaya mencegah pasang-surutnya kekalahan di pasar modal.
Pejabat di Tiongkok mungkin tidak wajib bertanggung jawab pada parlemen atau kongres yang terpilih secara demokratis – namun pejabat pemerintah memiliki satu badan – tujuh anggota komite Politbiro – dimana  mereka harus mempertanggungjawabkan kesalahannya.
Uni Eropa di sisi lain meminta – dan memberlakukan – kenaikan pada ketiga tarif pajak.
So long as they could finance deficits by printing a local currency and devaluing it from time to time, they would stick to their free-spending ways.
It promised peace, prosperity, and growing mutual respect, with political union as the ultimate goal.
Monetary union was always a risky bet, but it did not necessarily have to produce mass unemployment (more than half of all young people in Greece and Spain do not have a job).
This kind of problem already worried John Maynard Keynes at the time of the post-World War II Bretton Woods negotiations.
Independent central banks are a great thing, and ECB President Mario Draghi is a great central banker.
NEW YORK – In public policy, peace talks, election campaigns, or corporate strategy, laying out intentions, promises, and commitments is never enough.
Now consider free speech.
Everyone walks away knowing exactly what they are supposed to do, what to expect others to do, and what the consequences will be if they do not.
If they do not follow through on their intentions, promises, and commitments, access to information and instant communication is such that empty promises simply will no longer persuade most people.
But this process has not occurred, and, as the interminable Greek crisis has shown, the eurozone remains rife with structural weaknesses and extremely vulnerable to internal shocks.
The need to maintain this commitment to European unity, and overcome the economic difficulties that arise, is reinforced by new geopolitical challenges.
The problem is that Europeans have become so accustomed to muddling through that long-term solutions seem all but impossible.
Binding the union closer together could prove critical to building such trust.
Life is strewn with banana skins, and when you step on one you need to be able to adjust.
That is why economists of all stripes, whether or not they supported the introduction of the common currency, have spent the last five years developing and promoting a package of institutional reforms and policy changes that would make the eurozone less dysfunctional.
And no one is talking about real fiscal and political union, even though no one can imagine European Monetary Union surviving under the status quo.
If only anti-Europeans oppose EMU, the EU baby could end up being thrown out with the euro bathwater.
True, according to some estimates, the eurozone economy may now be growing at an annual rate of 1.6%, up from 0.9% in the year to the fourth quarter of 2014.
Given patchy global demand, rapid export growth will be difficult to achieve.
Nor can the small uptick in the eurozone’s growth, much less the relatively rapid expansion in Spain and Ireland, be attributed to the German recipe of fiscal consolidation and measures to increase export competitiveness.
Nor does Ireland – the fastest-growing EU economy last year – confirm the appropriateness of Germany’s policy prescriptions.
The immediate causes of recovery are not difficult to discern.
The weakening of the euro and the ECB’s aggressive measures may even stop the deflationary pressure later this year.
And austerity and reform fatigue in the eurozone periphery has been matched by bailout fatigue in the core, boosting support for a range of anti-euro parties in Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland.
Finally, Europe’s monetary union remains incomplete.
Small Steps to European Growth
Although growth may exceed the Commission’s forecast, there are reasons to be concerned about the eurozone’s growth potential.
Since 2010, the EU has been piling up coordination procedures in the hope of pushing governments into enacting politically difficult reforms.
There is broad agreement that streamlining is required; but that will not suffice.
Such institutions would be much better placed than the EU to formulate timely and granular reform recommendations.
This would be a good start.
The smoking gun is supposedly the €400 billion annual shortfall relative to 2007.
An ever-increasing capital stock relative to output, however, means ever-lower returns to capital and thus ever more non-performing loans in the banking sector over time.
Europe’s banking system already has more than €1 trillion in capital.
But there are fundamental reasons to believe that the eurozone’s investment rate will remain permanently depressed.
The weaker euro will stimulate eurozone countries’ exports – roughly half of which go to external markets – and thus will raise eurozone GDP.
At that time, the interest rate on ten-year Treasury bonds was close to 4%.
In contrast, long-term interest rates in the eurozone are already extremely low, with ten-year bond rates at about 50 basis points in Germany and France and only 150 basis points in Italy and Spain.
Here, the revenue loss could be offset by an increase in the personal tax rate.
The International Monetary Fund was established 70 years ago to manage an “adjustable peg” system – a hybrid system in which exchange rates were usually fixed to the US dollar, but could be adjusted occasionally to improve the country’s competitive position in export markets.
In 1991, the loss of monetary-policy independence seemed like a worthwhile trade-off for Europe’s economies; today, it seems that it may have been a mistake.
Unlike in Japan, eurozone countries’ failure to implement bold monetary-policy measures is not a choice.
Otherwise, they will continue to go from one crisis to the next, with countries that do fall within the optimal currency area – for example, Germany and France – facing the consequences.
A truly European currency built on German principles appeared to be the best way forward.
What really matters is whether a common European currency still makes sense for the future.
Third, it was (somewhat naively) believed that the institutions underpinning the euro would improve the overall quality of economic policy, as though Europe-wide policies would automatically be better than national ones.
Clarity is a prerequisite of serious discussion and ambitious reform.
The prescient calls from Joseph Stiglitz, Jeffrey Sachs, and many others for a different approach to sovereign debt in general need to be modified to fit the particular characteristics of the eurozone’s crisis.
The ECB will service (as opposed to purchase) a portion of every maturing government bond corresponding to the percentage of the member state’s public debt that is allowed by the Maastricht rules.
The Maastricht-compliant part of its members’ sovereign debt would be restructured with longer maturities (equal to the maturity of the ECB bonds) and at the ultra-low interest rates that only the ECB can fetch in international capital markets.
One such step is the debt-conversion program proposed here.
To be sure, the European Central Bank’s large-scale bond-buying program could be suppressing interest rates temporarily, and, once the purchases are halted next year, they will rise again.
When they are negligible, they flatter profit statements, while balance-sheet problems slowly accumulate.
But that debt costs only 1-2% of GDP to service, allowing Japan to remain solvent.
ALESSANDRIA, ITALY – Tax evasion is a global scourge.
To encourage customers to request official receipts as proof of payment, some local tax authorities issue a type of receipt that doubles as a lottery ticket.
Moreover, the method is vulnerable to illicit practices, such as collecting receipts issued to foreigners and students, who cannot claim their own refunds.
However, taxable income in the sector is still growing at a slower rate than gross income as measured by national accounts.
Evidence-Based Economics
Nevertheless, the radicals prevailed through what the economist Harry Johnson called “scorn and derision.”
When supply shocks hit the US economy, the neo-Keynesians’ response was to pour on more demand, believing it would revive employment.
In my view, this core tenet of supply-side economics rests on a simple blunder.
In that case, the tax cut, while gradually increasing private wealth, would decrease social wealth.
But the effectiveness of such tax cuts would be largely, if not wholly, transitory – especially if the welfare state was spared.
Chinese leaders blame Taiwanese leaders for cross-straits tensions, and blame the Dalai Lama for all that ails Tibet.
He even employed this phrase in his final State of the Union address in 2008, saying that “Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you….Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so negotiations can begin.”
Wilson could not implore his people to “kill the Krauts,” as British or French leaders frequently did, because so many of Wilson’s soldiers were, by ethnicity at least, Krauts themselves.
Again, imagine if recent history had gone differently, and Saddam had in fact taken the Bush administration’s eleventh-hour offer of exile rather than war. Or if the initial attempt made on Saddam’s life in the war’s first hours had been successful.
LA PAZ – Evo Morales succeeded in amending the Bolivia’s constitution and being re-elected President.
But the making of Morales as a leader able to combine these three dimensions reflects two institutional reforms in the 1990’s that expanded social participation and opened up opportunities for new leaders and political movements.
Soon gas was being exported – very profitably – to Brazil.
These not only increase household spending, but also offer opportunities for trade, in both the formal and informal sectors, making it the most successful policy in the fight against poverty.
Indeed, my field is now going through one of the most dynamic periods in its 150-year history.
One of the first attempts to square the theory with the evidence was proposed by my late colleague Motoo Kimura, who posited the existence of neutral mutations – gene variants that are neither advantageous nor harmful to an individual, and therefore not influenced by natural selection.
The field is in the process of gaining a better understanding of a host of complex systems within individual cells.
Evolutionary Theory’s Welcome Crisis
Other assumptions, however, are under threat.
For example, epigenetics – the study of heritable modifications of the genome that do not involve alterations to the genetic code – is on the rise.
Evolutionary theory’s current contretemps – and our inability to predict where the field will be in 50 years – are a cause for celebration.
Leverage is increasing, with some $57 trillion having piled up worldwide since the global financial crisis began.
And, indeed, debt and unfunded non-debt liabilities increasingly weigh down public-sector balance sheets and pension funds, eroding the foundations of resilient, sustainable growth.
There is also an intermediation problem.
If this turns to full-blown deflation, accompanied by uncontrolled rising real interest rates, the risk to growth would be serious.
Complementary reforms are needed to maintain and improve the transmission channels of monetary policy and avoid adverse side effects.
This is, of course, impossible, as surpluses and deficits must be in balance for the world economy as a whole.
China needs a major internal restructuring from exports and investments, its two engines of growth in past decades, to personal and government consumption (education, health, and social protection in the latter case).
Why should emerging-market countries’ central banks undertake this peculiar financial intermediation, which represents a major cost, as the yield of private funds is higher than that of reserves?
Recent IMF reforms are just a step in the direction of trying to create better financial instruments to help these countries.
The euro’s depreciation has been greeted with delight by Europe’s business leaders.
This was followed by a bill proposing a special levy on countries running large bilateral trade surpluses with the US.
And hedging against such a reversal merely builds up risk elsewhere in the international financial system.
NEW YORK – France’s new president, François Hollande, is not married to his partner, the glamorous political journalist Valerie Trierweiler, and no one seems to care.
In America in this election cycle, as in Europe, headlines are absent that in the past would have raised questions about an unmarried female partner, a working woman, a woman with a life of her own.
Another reason for the not-necessarily-married and not-necessarily-full-time political spouse has to do with simple generational change: the role of adoring wife that Nancy Reagan perfected is a time-consuming profession.
Both President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair urgently need a plausible exit strategy from Iraq.
The probability of Iraqi elections being held this coming January must be lower than 50%, and we can be certain that these will not be free and fair elections throughout the entire country.
History suggests that elections do not create democracies. They confirm that the conditions for a democratic order are present.
The second condition that must be satisfied before elections can be credible is security.
In a Muslim country, such a strategy would, moreover, provide protection against hijacking of the law by religious fanatics.
Although the rest of postcommunist Europe confronted such questions a decade ago, the Balkan wars of the 1990’s left both perpetrators and victims stuck in a time warp of justice delayed.
By contrast, Milosevic has taken advantage of the ICTY’s procedures to delay his trial, while challenging its jurisdiction and legitimacy.
It enters this end game facing diminished resources and waning political will within the international community.
There, too, the ICTY will not be missed.
Two years on, are good intentions the best that Obama’s new policy has to offer? After all, nothing of value has in fact resulted from them.
In both cases, standstill triumphed over progress.
They are internally divided between Fatah and Hamas, under Israeli occupation in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, isolated from the outside world in Gaza, hopeless in the region’s refugee camps, and rebuffed by their Arab neighbors.
The formula could run as follows: a comprehensive agreement about the final status now (taking into account all open questions, including East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine); implementation of the agreement in pre-defined steps over a longer period of time; and monitoring of the process via a mechanism based on the presence on the ground of a third party (led by the US).This would give Palestinians a guarantee of their state’s borders, its capital, and the Israeli occupation’s pre-defined endpoint.
Unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, democracy is not new to this 60-year-old state, but ethnic cleavages, weak institutions, and religious extremism in the North are perennially destabilizing.
Interestingly, in the midst of the political transition, Musharraf embarked on a week-long visit to China to lobby for construction of an oil and gas pipeline between China and the Persian Gulf that would be routed through Pakistan.
But it is significant that Bush decided to voice this view during Pakistan’s political transition.
After all, the victory of the secular Awami National Party (ANP) in Pakistan’s North-West Frontier Province is a strong indication that people there have rejected religious political forces and violence.
Bosnia was divided between a Muslim-Croat federation and a Serb republic, with little authority vested in the central government and a large international military – and eventually civilian – presence needed to hold it together.
The United States and the European Union are committed to a different vision: democratic transition and integration of all of the Balkans into NATO and eventually the EU. But they have been reluctant to impose conditions on Serbia, for fear of bringing even more radical nationalists to power.
In Bosnia, any further moves to undermine the essential compromise reached in the 1995 Dayton agreement should be met with the full powers of Bosnia’s “high representative,” who has recently negotiated an agreement that will strengthen the country’s fragile governing structure.
Expanding Crime and Punishment in Tibet
Having been found guilty -- the conviction rate in China is around 98%, and is even higher in Tibet, so the verdict was never in doubt – he was sentenced to five years in prison.
(The paper was apparently unaware that by then he had been in custody for five months.)
Nor are these the only cases.
More remarkable news has just emerged: despite slowing economic-growth rates, China, together with Hong Kong, has recorded $29 billion in initial public offerings so far this year – almost twice the funds raised in US markets.
More recently, China began to apply the same approach to building a more innovative, knowledge-based economy – one in which the services sectors, together with domestic consumption, drive growth.
China’s real-estate, credit, and stock-market bubbles – which produced ghost towns, bad local debts, and stock-price volatility – attest to that.
A Tale of Two Theories
The United States’ recovery is solid.
This seems paradoxical, because interest rates are close to zero in most advanced economies.
The Secular Stagnation Hypothesis is worrying, because it gives few reasons to believe that things will improve by themselves.
But cheap credit promotes bad investment and excessive debt, which borrowers often are unable to repay.
Both also fit only some of the facts.
NEW YORK – Nobody would care much about North Korea – a small and isolated country of 24 million people, ruled by a grotesque dynasty that calls itself communist – if it were not for its nuclear weapons.
But this lethal brew has a history, which needs to be explained.
Korean rulers only managed to survive by playing one foreign power off against the other, and by offering subservience, mainly to Chinese emperors, in exchange for protection.
China could crush North Korea in a day just by cutting off food and fuel supplies.
So far, they are just words. But small things – a shot in Sarajevo, as it were – can trigger a catastrophe.
It is impossible to advance toward political union while seeming to abandon Europe’s citizens along the way, which is the impression that unremitting austerity has created.
If that does not happen, next year’s European elections may give rise to an unfortunate paradox.
The European Parliament can exercise its power only if citizens feel represented there.
Given that Lula is an avowed leftist who counts Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro among his friends, Brazil’s performance is all the more surprising. How could he manage to preside over such a spectacular stock-market boom?
The news media typically present reasons to justify the view that the economy has entered a “new era.”
Why haven’t the stories of corruption caused a crisis, as similar scandals did in Korea and Malaysia during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98? Indeed, while the scandals have shaken the government, Lula was overwhelmingly reelected last year, and investors continue to pour money into the stock market.
After all, you don’t hear Canada’s foreign minister denying tension on his country’s American frontier, because the truth of that proposition is self-evident.
With China having established four new airbases in Tibet and three in its southern provinces bordering India, the Indian Air Force is reportedly augmenting its own presence near the Chinese border by deploying two squadrons of Sukhoi-30MKI fighters.
The reasons are not hard to identify. China’s recent troubles over Tibet have brought with them unwelcome reminders of India’s hospitality to the Dalai Lama and his government-in-exile.
Moreover, India has attempted to establish strategic ties with countries that China sees as falling within its own sphere of influence (from Mongolia to Vietnam, including direct competition over Myanmar).
But, all these years later, I have yet to meet anyone who knows what they are talking about who is prepared to defend Kyoto as a substantive global public policy. ”It was a way of getting the ball rolling,” on climate change, say some. ”It was a way of waking up the world to the seriousness of the problem,” say others.
Providing the proper incentives for effective research and development will not be easy. Public programs work less well when the best route to the goal – in this case, the most promising post-carbon energy technologies – is uncertain.
And many believe that whatever their weakness today, time is on the Palestinians’ side.
What I saw during those hours were, despite my personal condition, the most comforting and hopeful signs that I have encountered in the entire region in many years.
And it was fitting that this token of a possible future should be found in an ophthalmology department, an enterprise devoted to restoring vision.
Renzi’s Promise
This explains the popular appeal of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Beppe Grillo, the stand-up comedian who co-founded the populist Five Star Movement.
Specifically, he must help to find an alternative to the untenable mantra of “convergence” of policies and standards that has driven European integration – one that acknowledges countries’ divergent approaches to solving problems.
Face-to-Face with Facebook
Statistics recently published by the Pew Research Center’s Internet &amp; American Life Project (http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Reputation-Management.aspx) indicate that young people manage their reputations online more carefully than do older people.
They want to “evolve” on their own, rather than be pushed (or led unwittingly) by Facebook.
If your friends and other people can see it, so can you.
They like to be treated as individuals, not to be put into buckets.
The Second Nuclear Age
Israel also is launching a new generation of satellites to provide early warning of other countries’ preparations for missile strikes.
It has rehearsed quick missile salvos, showing that it could launch attacks on South Korea and Japan before any counter-strike could be landed.
Given America’s economic problems and looming defense cuts, as well as growing Chinese power, there is no longer even a remote possibility that this demand will be made.
His view, in essence, means that the current financial crisis is the final proof that markets do not process information efficiently.
In such circumstances, prices may well move far from the fundamentals as assessed by a hypothetical collective wisdom that would pool all information in the market.
Executives collected generous bonuses, and equity holders were protected by limited liability.
Failing states in Central America
Many economists believe that a major reason for the quetzal’s strength against the dollar in recent years has been the amount of drug money laundered through the Guatemalan financial system.
The condition of the Central American judiciary is at the heart of the prospect of state failure.
Significant improvements to this situation will be hard won.
France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Portugal, in collaboration with the United States, presented a draft resolution before the United Nations Security Council seeking to condemn repression in Syria and put an end to the use of force against civilians.
The Assad government does not hesitate to fire on civilians, lay siege to cities, or shut off their electricity and water.
In the case of the resolution on military intervention in Libya, the BRICS decided "to let" Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi be overthrown.
Likewise, an ambitious reform of the International Monetary Fund was adopted in 2010 to reflect changes in the global distribution of power.
For companies, renegotiations mean uncertainty and possible interruptions of production and revenue.
So, even without corruption, it is not surprising when a future government demands that the contract be renegotiated.
The ICAF would function like an escrow account into which the firm pays the funds required for the host country to hire a negotiating team. The escrow account manager then invites the country to select a team, suggesting what skills are required and perhaps even providing a roster of experts.

Abusive employers exploit their labor.
Most were left to their own devices to escape the violence, and many died trying.
Before the next crisis erupts, we need to clarify the critical roles that all key actors – including countries of origin and destination, neighboring states, businesses, and civil society – should play.
Destination countries have equally profound responsibilities in crises.
We need not be overwhelmed by the dizzying array of problems plaguing migrants.
There are more Muslims in China than in Europe, more practicing Protestants than in England, and more practicing Catholics than in Italy.
In any developed nation, you will find selfless care being provided to the disabled, the dying, the destitute, and the disadvantaged, by people acting under the impulse of their faith.
But such a world requires that mutual respect replace mutual suspicion.
Of course, throughout time, religion has often been part of a political conflict.
And we have an action program through which young people work with those of another faith to raise awareness of the Millennium Development Goals, the United Nations-led program to combat world poverty.
Together, they do constitute a real challenge to people of faith.
The immediate cause of this disaster is clear: the rains have failed for two years running in the dry regions of East Africa.
As a result, the Ethiopian-Somalia border has been war-torn for decades. 
There is no interest in Washington, DC, in addressing the needs of America’s poor, much less the needs of the world’s poor.
The Millennium Villages Project, which I have the honor of helping to lead, has demonstrated that pastoralist communities can be empowered through targeted investments in livestock management, veterinary care, business development, mobile health clinics, boarding schools, and local infrastructure such as safe water points, off-grid electricity, and mobile telephony.
NEW YORK &#45;&#45; The notion of a divide between the rich north and the poor and developing south has long been a central concept among economists and policymakers.
These countries have experienced unprecedented levels of sustained economic growth that may well enable them to replace the “Affluents” as engines of the world economy.
This requires policy changes as well as more generous and more effective aid.
Otherwise, we might bid farewell to old development divides only to welcome new ones.
The capacity for continuing this policy will soon be depleted, as the central-bank money flowing from the GIPS countries to the core countries of the eurozone increasingly crowds out the money created through refinancing operations there.
The sole exception is Ireland, which is suffering not from a lack of competitiveness, but from capital flight.
Estimates for Greece assume that prices and wages need to come down by 20-30%.
Farewell to the Neo-Classical Revolution
The last liberal cycle, associated with President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and the economist John Maynard Keynes, was triggered by the Great Depression, though it took World War II’s massive government spending to get it properly going. During the three-decade-long Keynesian era, governments in the capitalist world managed and regulated their economies to maintain full employment and moderate business fluctuations.&#160;
The future is inherently uncertain, and therefore investor psychology is fickle.
But if we look at the historical record, the liberal regime of the 1950’s and 1960’s was more successful than the conservative regime that followed.
The classical economics of the 1920’s abstracted from the problem of unemployment by assuming that it did not exist.
Former Salvadoran guerrilla leader Joaquín Villalobos’ lapidary conclusion about the Colombian narco-guerrilla movement is worthy of consideration, given his unmatched insight into Latin America’s armed, revolutionary left.
Democratic transitions throughout the hemisphere had made guerrilla warfare unjustifiable: as Che foretold in his La Guerra de Guerrillas in 1962, wherever the trappings (or, one might add, the realities) of democratic rule prevailed, taking up arms was pointless.
But, having met Chávez personally a dozen times, it appears naïve, at least to me, to attribute great significance or conviction to anything he says – moderate, hard left, or in between.
Despite a landslide electoral victory for his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) last September, Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama resigned only 262 days after taking office.
Ozawa’s aspiration to make the next election the grand finale of his political career by cementing the DPJ as a party of government now seems in jeopardy.
In 1999, Ozawa seized control of the DPJ, which Hatoyama and Naoto Kan, the new prime minister, had founded.
The likely ongoing instability within the DPJ makes it all the more important that the LDP seriously reform itself.

This “globesity” epidemic is seen in poor countries as well as in wealthy ones.
Moreover, we have abundant access to “bad” or “fast” cheap food and an absence of opportunities for physical activity in areas of extreme poverty: this is the “obesity of poverty” argument – that is, poverty is a contributory factor in morbid weight gain.
Today, this agent is the adenovirus 36 (Ad–36), which stimulates the growth and reproduction of fat cells, as well as causing immature fat cells to mature more quickly, at least in chickens.
To see a world-wide epidemic of fat caused by a conspiracy of fast-food producers and our genes strikes one as weird: but the dieting culture relies on the sense that we must control this epidemic.
At least four (Muhammad al-Ghuneim, Salim al-Zanoun, Abbas Zaki, and Nasser Kidra) are hardliners, and most of the rest follow pretty much the traditional Fatah line.
The most interesting additions to the Central Committee are three younger men, though they have played leading roles in the organization for 20 years or more.
It is also extremely important that most of Fatah’s new leaders have a strong distaste for Hamas, which makes rapprochement between the two groups unlikely.
These technologically sophisticated fanatics are able to reach a wide audience.
So the disappointed and disaffected search for an Islam that meets their expectations.
But the Wahhabis tried to appropriate Mecca for their own version of Islam, and to export their exclusionary doctrine.
The most extreme preach the ideas of Al Qaeda and their ideological brethren.
The $4.3 Billion Shrug
The more important reason, though, is that even $4.3 billion is small change when compared to the total fines and litigation costs incurred by the major banks over the last five years.
The regulators maintain that much of this insurance was worthless to borrowers and was mis-sold.
Today, the payments have become so large that the government has seized them and channeled revenues exceeding the regulator’s enforcement costs to veterans’ charities.
Whether the current approach serves as an effective deterrent is a question that should be widely debated.
Despite these sentiments, Microsoft is helping the Chinese authorities to repress information as best they can.
To be sure, a corporation can and should place limits on the use of its services.
The most difficult of Gates’s three examples is that of pro-Nazi statements on a Web site aimed at Germany.
Since the two parties’ leaders, Heinz-Christian Strache and Jörg Haider, despise each other, there is little chance of a far-right coalition taking power.
Voters for the far right may be motivated less by ideology than by anxieties and resentments that are felt in many European countries, including ones with no Nazi tradition, such as The Netherlands and Denmark.
This is linked to resentment of immigrants.
But the new populism is not yet undemocratic, or even anti-democratic.
There is no need for liberal, traditional parties, in a fit of panic, to battle the right by pandering to the same resentments. But those resentments should be taken seriously in political debates.
In the first six months of 2004, there were already 1208 stories. The results were much the same when I searched "outsourcing," "jobs", and "China."
Once we saw our exaggerated hopes for our investments failing, we began to consider our other sources of income and wealth, only to confront the worldwide economic slowdown that began in 2001.
Growing fear of foreign competition ought to explain a lot of things in the future. People used to feel insulated from economic problems that occurred beyond their country's borders.
We must not let this happen.
Its scale is staggering: more than $4 trillion of mergers and acquisitions this year, with tradable and (theoretically) liquid financial assets reaching perhaps $160 trillion by the end of this year, all in a world where annual global GDP is perhaps $50 trillion.
If each of these factors accounts for one-third of the net gain, several conclusions follow.
Eighteenth-century physiocrats believed that only the farmer was productive, and that everyone else was somehow cheating the farmers out of their fair share.
After the inflations of World War I, a prudent investor might have thought gold – easily assessable, portable, and real – an attractive asset.
Fear as much as institutional blockages may be the source of what is either a global savings glut or a global investment shortfall, depending on how you view it.
Eurozone Budgets Under the Spotlight
This requirement of the eurozone’s Stability and Growth Pact, specified by Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, applies to member states that fail to meet their commitments to bring their budget deficits below 3% of GDP.
This is not a far-fetched scenario, and its realization would play havoc with the budgets of many indebted eurozone member states.
FRANKFURT – It looks like a coordinated offensive: on September 6, the European Central Bank outlined a new bond-buying program, letting markets know that there were no pre-set limits to its purchases.
All of its asset purchases will be sterilized, meaning that their monetary-policy effects will be offset.
Seen from the rest of the world, things are not much better.
SAN FRANCISCO – There is a big difference between the Federal Reserve’s mandate to maintain “stable prices” – as enunciated in the Federal Reserve Act – and the Fed’s self-selected target of 2% annual inflation.
The discussion quickly turned to the difficulty of measuring inflation accurately and the need to build in a “safety cushion” to avoid deflation.
Following the discussion, Greenspan exhorted the FOMC members to keep the discussion of the inflation target secret.
BEIJING – Fixated on inflation targeting in a world without inflation, central banks have lost their way.
In the Fed’s case, the presumption that the US will soon approach full employment has caused the so-called dual mandate to collapse into one target: getting inflation back to 2%.
It would rather attribute low inflation to successful inflation targeting, and the Great Moderation that it presumably spawned.
Not only have they failed repeatedly to get the inflation forecast right; they now risk fueling renewed financial instability and sparking another crisis.
It is time for them to turn their policy arsenal toward today’s enemy: financial instability.
Another reason not to panic is that, compared to 2013, when policy rates were low in many fragile emerging economies, central banks already have tightened their monetary policy significantly.
Its problems are mostly self-inflicted – the result of loose monetary, fiscal, and credit policies, all of which must now be tightened, during President Dilma Roussef’s first administration.
CAMBRIDGE – In its September policy statement, the US Federal Reserve took into consideration – in a major way – the impact of global economic developments on the United States, and thus on US monetary policy.
What little impact import price shocks have on US inflation is highly transitory, with most of the effect tapering off after just two quarters.

If the Fed decides to raise interest rates this year, which emerging markets are most vulnerable to a capital-flow reversal?
As a result of reduced debt and enhanced reserves, their creditworthiness improved during the 2003-2007 boom.
A less visible threat is the denomination of debt in dollars and other foreign currencies.
Unfortunately, in the last five years, many emerging markets have reverted to borrowing in foreign currency.
Consider the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where discussions of raising the benchmark federal funds rate were couched in adjectives, rather than explicit actions.
More important, the Fed’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet has since grown more than fivefold.
The unprecedented financial engineering by central banks over the last six years has been decisive in setting asset prices in major markets worldwide. But now it is time for the Fed and its counterparts elsewhere to abandon financial engineering and begin marshaling the tools they will need to cope with the inevitable next crisis.
The low level of all interest rates that resulted from this policy drove investors to buy equities and to increase the prices of owner-occupied homes.
Moreover, low interest rates have created a new problem: liquidity mismatch.
Others fear that, even without such financial shocks, the economy’s current strong performance will not continue when interest rates are raised.
Consider a few dismal statistics reflecting the current state of affairs.
When there is no yield in fixed income, even the most conservative pension funds pile into risk assets, driving prices higher and higher.
As the Fed slowly raises interest rates, those middle-class families holding their hard-earned savings at the bank will finally start realizing some return on their deposits.
No economic recovery can sustain itself without rising wages and higher consumer spending power.
Furthermore, this period of monetary tightening had unexpected consequences; financial institutions like Citicorp found that only regulatory forbearance saved them from having to declare bankruptcy, and much of Latin America was plunged into a depression that lasted more than five years.
The US unemployment rate may seem to hint at the risk of rising inflation, but the employment-to-population ratio continues to signal an economy in deep distress.
What would most benefit commercial banks is not an immediate increase in interest rates, but a monetary policy that contributes to ensuring that the economy is capable of supporting higher interest rates in the future.
The reason we should fear this possibility is that the world’s economic equilibrium is both fragile and unstable – and could wobble dangerously without determined and coordinated policy intervention.
The reasoning is that emerging economies have become dangerously dependent on low interest rates and high commodity prices.
There is no ECB for the emerging economies. They cannot be confident of appropriate reactions by their policymakers to rapid capital outflows, or of their capacity in terms of policy tools, reserves, and balance sheets.
Instead of focusing on how to bolster bank stability – channeling more capital toward the largest institutions, curbing their riskiest activities, and determining how to manage a failing bank without bailing it out – the officials discussed the bankers themselves.
Dudley also placed the onus for change on senior bank managers.
Catalyzing a shift in bank culture will not be easy.
Tarullo and Dudley understand this – but other, less adept officials may not.
Reflecting the New York Fed's heavy regulatory responsibilities, owing to its proximity to the seat of finance, its president has a permanent seat on the Federal Open Market Committee, the body that sets the Fed's benchmark interest rate.
When the US last experienced a crisis of this magnitude, in the 1930s, the Federal Reserve System similarly came under Congressional scrutiny.
Ultimately, whether significant changes are warranted should depend on whether the central bank's interventions in fact aggravated the recent crisis, as they aggravated the crisis of the 1930s.
The Federal Reserve System has always been a work in progress.
The move marks a turning point in the Fed’s approach to the economy. In deciding to raise interest rates, it will be doing more than simply lifting its foot from the financial-stimulus accelerator; it will also be taking a notable step toward the multiyear normalization of its overall policy stance.
If history is any guide, there are three major issues that warrant careful monitoring in the coming months.
Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic have the ability to lower the risk of instability by implementing structural reforms, ensuring more balanced aggregate demand, removing pockets of excessive indebtedness, and smoothing out the mechanisms of multilateral and regional governance.
What really shocked the markets was not the Fed’s decision to maintain zero interest rates for a few more months, but the statement that accompanied it.
If monetary policy is used to try to push unemployment below some pre-determined level, inflation will accelerate without limit and destroy jobs.
That brings us back to recent financial events.
But there may be a deeper reason for the Fed’s forbearance.
The bad news is that the vast majority of market analysts, still clinging to the old monetarist framework, will accuse the Fed of “falling behind the curve” by letting US unemployment decline too far and failing to anticipate the threat of rising inflation.
The International Monetary Fund has weighed in forcefully, calling on the Fed to wait longer before raising rates.
To say that 0.25%, or even 1%, is high in this environment is pure hyperbole.
The best defense against these pressures is to operate according to utterly unambiguous criteria.
Somebody on the committee has to lead the camel to water.
Think Japan, and its corporate zombies of the 1990’s. Just as they wrote the script for the first of Japan’s lost decades, their counterparts are now doing the same for the US economy.
Moreover, the debt overhang remains massive.
But the Fed’s policy gambit has taken the US down the wrong road.
For a world beset by seemingly endemic financial instability, this could prove to be the most destructive development of all.
Its decisions about interest rates and financial regulation reverberate through global markets and affect millions of lives. Yet its governance structure is of another age – antiquated, increasingly problematic, and urgently in need of sensible reform.
His choices included Dick Fuld, CEO of Lehman Brothers, which failed spectacularly in September 2008, and Stephen Friedman, a Goldman Sachs board member, who resigned as chair of the New York Fed’s board after being accused of inappropriately trading Goldman stock during the financial crisis.
BRUSSELS – August was quieter than feared on the European bond markets.
Unlike in the US, where federal public spending grew as a consequence of the creation of new expenditure programs throughout the twentieth century, public spending was already high at the national level when Europe began to integrate.
In other words, the price of solidarity is limited sovereignty.
Indeed, a major problem with the current state of affairs is the weakness of EU institutions that are in charge of advancing the common interest and that are accountable to Europeans as a whole.
In an era of globalization, with rapid economic growth in some areas and stagnation in others – and with television and the internet allowing us to see how others live – these comparisons are an increasingly important factor in the world economy.
The economist Albert Hirschman once likened a society with recognizably distinct groups to a multilane highway where people are unable to change lanes.
Consider the rampant anti-Semitism – some of it ultimately genocidal – that arose during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
But, regardless of whether these comparisons occur in an economy that is growing or contracting, the anxiety that they engender clearly represents a potential risk of unrest and instability.

An entire academic discipline emerged out of the wholesale critique of the male tendency to create hierarchy, engage in territoriality, and be drawn to conflict.
Reading Fisher, one is more inclined to leave boys alone to challenge one another and test their environment, and to accept that, as she puts it, nature designed men and women to collaborate for survival.
Somehow, all this is liberating rather than infuriating.
In fact, Argentina is the only developed country that has succeeded, in the period from World War II until today, in mismanaging its way out of the First World.
Of course, when you control the official statistics office, you can claim any inflation rate you want; but that does not lower the price of bread.
This year was no different.
Foreigners are more circumspect.
It is a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the World Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and various other prestigious international bodies.
Unrecognized by the rest of the world, Transdniestrian “independence” is secured by a Russian garrison.
The state, however, is a political construction, designed to keep the peace in an economically viable territory.
But the lesson from the current crisis is that we will have to develop styles of global economic governance to manage, regulate, and mitigate the creative, but often disruptive forces unleashed by the global market.
So, not only has good – or better-than-expected – economic news boosted the markets, but even bad news has been good news, because it increases the probability that central-banking firefighters like US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will douse the markets with buckets of cash.
Moreover, Greece could exit the eurozone in 2013, before Spain and Italy are successfully ring-fenced; Spain – like Greece – is spiraling into depression, and may need a full-scale bailout by the “troika” (the ECB, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund).
And, given a new leadership’s caution as it establishes its power, reforms will occur at a snail’s pace, making social and political unrest more likely.
But, as everyone kicks the can down the road, the can is getting heavier and, in the major emerging markets and advanced economies alike, is approaching a brick wall.
There have also been calls for sponsors, including McDonalds, Visa, Coca-Cola, Adidas, Budweiser, Gazprom, KIA, and Hyundai, to place pressure on FIFA and Qatar to improve working conditions.
Globalization should force managers – and all of us – to do some serious thinking about labor practices around the world.
In this sense, the larger the company, the greater its responsibility.
Companies are made up of people.
American mobsters have had a major interest in boxing, for example.
This did not start under Blatter. It was his predecessor, the sinister Brazilian João Havelange, who turned FIFA into a corrupt and vastly rich empire by incorporating more and more developing countries, whose votes for the bosses were bought with all manner of lucrative marketing and media deals.
Things have changed since the days when venal men from poor countries were paid off to further Western political or commercial interests. This still occurs, of course.
This is the most irritating aspect of Blatter’s FIFA.
As medical advances and technological developments have helped cancer patients in high-income countries to live longer – to the extent that some forms of cancer have effectively become chronic conditions – those in low-income countries continue to die young.
Then there is hepB, which is over 50 times more infectious than HIV and often passed from mother to child before or shortly after birth, increasing the likelihood of liver cancer later in life.
But the GAVI Alliance intervened to ensure that this is no longer a concern with hepB, and it is unlikely to occur with HPV.
Meanwhile, people in developing countries lack access to simple and effective tools for preventing several of the most common cancers.
Perhaps they do.
Sometimes switching from the “bad” to the corresponding “good” is simply a matter of semantics: to fight against racism is to fight for nondiscrimination.
That has not been Uganda’s experience.
As Francis Fukuyama has pointed out, the development of a capable state that is accountable and ruled by law is one of the crowning achievements of human civilization.
For some, that is a price worth paying; for others, the costs seem too high.
An undifferentiated approach towards political Islamism that fails to distinguish between those who reject violence and those who resort to terror only facilitates the extremists’ work, for they emerge as champions of causes that do not reflect their true goals.
Intelligence forces in authoritarian states are either highly centralized or tend to become autonomous power centers.
The right to public speech and peaceful assembly must be defended for those who feel marginalized and indignant at what they – and most Europeans – view as injustices committed against the Palestinians, the Chechens, and the Iraqis.
Terrorism is nothing new, nor is it a single enemy.
Terrorists in the mid-20th century tended to have relatively well-defined political objectives, which were often ill-served by mass murder.
In the 1970's, the Palestinian attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics and attacks by groups like the Red Brigades galvanized world attention at the cost of dozens of lives.
Deliberate killing of non-combatants (in war or not) is condemned by most major religions, including Islam.
Countries cooperate out of self-interest, but a country's soft or attractive power, not only its military might, affects the degree of cooperation.
Clearly, it wonâ€™t be the last.
At the same time, as the British have shown, groups like al-Qaeda are best dealt with by good intelligence.
With American influence at low ebb, the world is in danger of sliding into a vicious cycle of escalating violence.
The ratio of total financial assets (stocks, bonds, and bank deposits) to GDP in the United Kingdom was about 100% in 1980, while by 2006 it had risen to around 440%.
Investment banks with leverage of more than 30 times their capital in early 2007 are now down to little more than ten times.
As Haldane puts it, “banking became the goose laying the golden eggs.”
They are typically very astute at risk management, unlike many of the banks that dramatically increased their leverage – and thus their risks – during the last 20 years.
There will be winners and losers, of course, but systematic sectoral out-performance looks unlikely.
Diamond started to fight back, pointing an accusatory finger at the Bank of England.
Bigger companies, with more complex balance sheets, have more places to hide them.
The final lesson is that the big showdowns between democracy and big bankers are still to come – both in the United States and in continental Europe.
Now, given the profound sovereign-debt crisis in the eurozone periphery, government defaults threaten to take down the big banks.
The lessons of 1914 are about more than simply the dangers of national animosities.
Economic warfare, if implemented in full, would wreck Germany’s financial system and force it out of any military conflict.
They were convinced that Germany and the US were growing stronger year by year, while British power would erode.
Chinese banks are being pushed to expand their role in global commerce.
NEW YORK – Recent market volatility – in emerging and developed economies alike – is showing once again how badly ratings agencies and investors can err in assessing countries’ economic and financial vulnerabilities.
For many investors, credit ratings dictate where and how much they can invest.
As we have seen in recent crises, private risk taking and debt are socialized when a crisis occurs.
Other emerging markets also look fragile and at risk of an eventual downgrade.
But is the recovery of asset prices driven by economic fundamentals?
Worse, the recovery is likely to be anemic and sub-par – well below potential for a couple of years, if not longer – as the burden of debts and leverage of the private sector combine with rising public sector debts to limit the ability of households, financial firms, and corporations to lend, borrow, spend, consume, and invest.
As a result, one cannot rule out that by late 2010 or 2011, a perfect storm of oil above $100 a barrel, rising government-bond yields, and tax increases (as governments seek to avoid debt-refinancing risks) may lead to a renewed growth slowdown, if not an outright double-dip recession.
Like the view that running away from lions provokes them to eat you, there is a grain of truth in the view that banks fail because depositors panic.
Until the financial reforms adopted since the crisis, this “shadow” banking system operated outside the regulatory regime that applied to traditional deposit-taking banks.
Why were we all taken in by the idea that we could make ourselves collectively richer by selling each other overpriced equities and houses? We were collectively irrational, but that is no explanation.
Perhaps ordinary citizens always knew that when they sold houses for real gains, ultimately they were profiting at someone else’s expense.
Indeed, Laos was among the worst-affected countries.
Looking back at the crisis a decade later, we can see more clearly how wrong the diagnosis, prescription, and prognosis of the IMF and United States Treasury were.
Whether US investors had greater expertise in banking in emerging markets may be debatable; that they had greater expertise in tax avoidance is not.
Nor, therefore, is it surprising that the world is once again facing a period of global financial instability, with uncertain outcomes for the world’s economies.


At his afternoon briefing, White House press secretary Jay Carney confirmed that Obama was indeed unharmed.
The first mover’s algorithm worked, regardless of the story’s veracity.
But their efforts will not be enough.
Empirically, few firms get this right: America’s National Public Radio and the BBC were both recently hacked by the SEA, while McDonald’s and Burger King recently had their Twitter accounts compromised.
Financial Re-Regulation and Democracy
And that leaves open the question: can we trust them? To me, the answer is an unambiguous no, which is why we need to “hard-wire” more of the regulatory framework.
But the criteria for judgment are clear: the new law must curb the practices that jeopardized the entire global economy, and reorient the financial system towards its proper tasks – managing risk, allocating capital, providing credit (especially to small- and medium-sized enterprises), and operating an efficient payments system.
There are many ways of curbing big banks’ excesses.
But in the last seven years, since central banks in developed countries pushed down their base rates almost to zero, we have seen a First-World version of financial repression.
Not surprisingly, central banks do not like this argument.
A further distortion stems from the prudential regulation adopted in reaction to the global financial crisis.
Furthermore, excess savings could be more than just a cyclical phenomenon.
This process, slow at first, has been driven by the combined impact of two sets of durable forces.
As a result of these two factors, established institutions – particularly the large banks – will be inclined to do fewer things for fewer people, despite being flush with liquidity provided by central banks (the “liquidity paradox”).
Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, expressed it well in his 2015 shareholder letter, observing that “Silicon Valley” is coming.
WASHINGTON, DC – At least since the fall of 2008, leading economies’ officials have agreed – in principle – that something must be done about financial firms that are “too big to fail.”
Bear Stearns’ shareholders did not do well and much of its management immediately left the scene, but creditors were fully protected (in fact, ensuring this protection was a central motivation for the Fed’s intervention).
There is, arguably, better communication than there was before 2008, but when the chips are down, this will be worth little.
Unfortunately, the failure of the international FSB approach means that the Fed must largely go it alone.
There are many other groupings.
I was a member of the FSF for five years.
They would also record that pressure from the FSB has accelerated the work of sectoral regulators. The second Basel accord took more than a decade to conclude; Basel 3 was drawn up in little more than 24 months (though implementation is taking quite long).
Unlike the World Trade Organization, for example, no international treaty underpins the FSB, which means that countries cannot be sanctioned for failing to implement the standards to which they are ostensibly committed.
In the 1990’s, Argentina tied its hands with a dollar-pegged currency in order to enhance its credibility as a borrower.
If the fallout of the New York decision is an extensive Argentine default on other obligations, foreign trade will become practically impossible, many goods will become scarce, and domestic inflation will increase further.
Latin America experienced this dilemma in the 1980’s, when its debt arithmetic had become unsustainable.
The emergence of inextinguishable debt replicates other troubling aspects of contemporary life.
Those who cannot forget the past are condemned to inflate it.
Such “super-equivalence” or, more colloquially, “gold-plating” creates inconsistencies across jurisdictions, thereby facilitating regulatory arbitrage.
So what can be done? The FMLC makes four important recommendations.
Regulatory uncertainty may not seem like the most exciting topic, which is probably why the FMLC report has attracted so little attention.
Indeed, it is no surprise that the most brutish and violent groups in the world, such as Nigeria’s Boko Haram, attack education.
The results have been remarkable: millions of lives have been saved, and economic growth has been boosted.
The additional financing required is modest.
Arab governments would want to ensure that all Arabic-speaking children receive a decent ICT-backed education; Brazil and Portugal would surely contribute to ensure that Africa’s many Portuguese speakers benefit from scaled-up education systems.
The decision has been postponed until early next year.
One country’s inflow of EU money is thus another country’s outflow – and these are grants, not loans.
Following a request by a member state, the Commission would be entitled to borrow on capital markets under the implicit EU budget guarantee, with the maximum amount determined by the size of the country’s unused (pre-allocated) Structural and Cohesion Funds.
Crises are typically associated with a drop not only in actual growth, but also in a country’s growth potential, owing to deferred investment.
The wind farms that we built convert the wind’s kinetic energy into electricity.
The US Department of Energy now provides an upfront payment to wind developers equal to 30% of costs.
Fifteen months ago, in a submission to the Economic Affairs Committee of the House of Lords, I predicted that all existing UK projects except Thanet Offshore Wind would be abandoned or postponed unless Parliament radically altered its Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROC) scheme.
Financing the Fight against Climate Change
But that is not the case.
The returns such projects could generate go beyond addressing carbon emissions.
This means that the developed countries that lend the SDRs would incur no interest expense and no responsibility for repayment. There are some serious technical problems involved in offsetting the interest income against the interest expense, particularly in the United States, but the net effect would be a wash.
Yet it could make the difference between success and failure in Copenhagen.
It will require a mix of new public sources, a scaling-up of existing public sources, and increased private flows.
We need to make progress on establishing the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund, including, possibly, regional and thematic vehicles, such as an Africa Green Fund.
Germany’s unemployment rate this past summer was around 5.5%, and its youth unemployment rate was around 8% – remarkably low compared with many other high-income economies.
But, in energy-efficient Switzerland, energy use is just 100 kg per $1,000 of GDP, and in Demark it is just 110 kg, compared with 190 kg in the US.
Brazil is the recent pacesetter, markedly expanding public education and systematically attacking remaining pockets of poverty through targeted transfer programs.
Of course, back in the real world, most countries will not achieve such bliss anytime soon.
In the US, for example, the monetary base more than doubled in a year.
First, different countries have different capacities to sustain public debt, depending on their initial deficit levels, existing debt burden, payment history, and policy credibility.
Firewalls to Freedom
Hundreds of thousands of people are employed as freelance Web commentators, working to spin discussions in chat rooms and on blogs in a more patriotic, pro-government direction.
A series of cyber-attacks followed, and was so devastating that the entire service – with its millions of other blogs – crashed, forcing LiveJournal administrators to delete his account temporarily.
Moreover, Li has called upon the banking sector to reinvigorate idle capital and allocate incremental capital more effectively.
Cash-strapped local governments began seizing farmland in order to sell it to commercial real-estate developers, while accumulating massive debt through off-balance-sheet loans and short-term interbank funding to finance local-government investment vehicles and real-estate investment.
In recent years, the central government has tightened its control over the banking sector, undermining the financial system’s development, not least by impeding banks’ ability to assess credit risk.
BOSTON – The Bible enjoins us to do better unto our children than we would do unto ourselves: “From generation to generation.”
In addition, it doesn’t ignore the positive – the current and future taxes available to cover these liabilities.
Even the official debt numbers are starting to record the magnitude of what’s coming. Indeed, by 2017, just six years from now, official US debt will exceed 90% of GDP – the value that Carmen Reinhart, Kenneth Rogoff, and other prominent economists believe is an historical indicator of insolvency.
In 1965, the US national saving rate and net domestic investment rate were 15.7% and 14%, respectively.
This may sound like a worst-case scenario, but in my view it is the most likely one: woe unto our children – and our parents.
Moreover, the critics object, the evidence in support of expansionary fiscal consolidations is flawed.
They understand that their countries’ fiscal positions are unsustainable.
Fiscal velocity may be considerable – that is, deficits may be large – but there is no sign of a brick wall ahead.
It is almost as if governments like Britain’s are attempting to manipulate the private sector into believing that the dire conditions required for an expansionary fiscal consolidation have already been met.
The second most serious problem is the looming long-term explosion in the costs of America’s health care programs.
Many of these things are, and will be, expensive.
Moreover, the overall level of spending is likely to be large.
At a time when every component of private demand was collapsing, the boost from higher government spending and lower taxes stopped the global economy’s free-fall and created the basis for recovery.
On one hand, stimulus had become a dirty word – even within the Obama administration – well before the Republicans’ mid-term election victory ruled out another round altogether.
In the United Kingdom, the new government gave several reasons for front-loading fiscal consolidation.
But all debt is not created equal.
This narrow, short-term focus differs from the approach taken for publicly traded companies, for which the strength of the balance sheet and the economy’s potential are emphasized, alongside annual income statements.
To be sure, some progress is being made toward bringing longer-term considerations into annual budget rules.
If the marginal real interest rate is 1%, an increase in public investment would actually reduce future indebtedness.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble is politically committed to outdoing his country’s tough domestic fiscal framework to secure what he calls a “black zero” budget.
In any case, a rating change would hardly affect funding costs in the current low-yield environment, as lower-rated sovereigns have demonstrated.
In part, this means that existing infrastructure projects that are supposed to be financed from national budgets could be funded by the EIB.
NEW YORK – The world’s economies are becoming more interdependent than ever, but economic nationalism, protectionism, and beggar-thy-neighbor attitudes are threatening the bonds of trust and cooperation that a truly globalized economy requires.
Although the proliferation of bilateral trade agreements around the world is a positive development, the global economy will suffer enormously if these deals end up coming at the expense of comprehensive agreements, which can do exponentially more to foster global growth.
Finally, innovation must be promoted as a long-term generator of growth.
Private-sector deleveraging continued, but was counter-balanced by rising public-sector deficits and debt.
First, it would include credible plans in Europe and the US to restore fiscal balance.
America’s reluctance to target areas of weakness or fragility leaves the impression externally that QE2’s real goal is to weaken the dollar.
That structural shift, in combination with the renminbi’s strengthening effective real exchange rate relative to the dollar, owing to inflation and rapidly rising wages in export sectors, offers hope that China’s surplus will fall.
The problem is that it can’t, even with a depreciating currency.
Since the Plan’s introduction, China’s current-account surplus as a share of GDP has indeed fallen.
While the increase in investment reduced the saving/GDP ratio, the resulting increase in imports lowered the trade surplus/GDP ratio.
The worsening terms of trade have been a major factor contributing to the decline in the current-account surplus in recent years.
The number of people covered by basic old-age insurance, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, and maternity insurance has risen substantially.
Fixing America’s Broken Housing Market
This stance is perplexing and possibly dangerous.
The Federal Reserve Board is no longer the lender of last resort, but the lender of first resort.
Resuscitating the housing market is all the more difficult for two reasons.
What is needed is a quick write-down of the value of the mortgages.
The problem is certainly not a lack of commitments, including those made at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.
Further attempts to sustainably manage the marine environment emerged 10 years after the Rio meeting, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa.
This critical shortcoming must be resolved.
Employment in fisheries in many countries is projected to grow again over the coming decades as depleted stocks recover.
By identifying the problems and envisioning the preferred solution, one can define the set of constraints into which technological innovation fits, and establish a clear, albeit often difficult, path to its realization.
Early in my career, this reaction troubled me; it made me wonder whether I had, in fact, overlooked something obvious.
But only about 15% of the drugs that the US Food and Drug Administration has approved recently were developed by the same company that markets and sells them, meaning that many major pharmaceutical companies depend on the innovation ecosystem to advance their products.
With an innovation ecosystem organized along these lines, “obvious” advances could occur significantly faster.
Second, Moreno-Ocampo has inexplicably decided to indict only Sudan’s president and not also the other members of the political and military leadership that together with him have planned, ordered, and organized the massive crimes in Darfur.
Furthermore, Moreno-Ocampo has inferred al-Bashir’s genocidal intent from a set of facts and conduct that in his view amount to a clear indication of such intent.
But European Union leaders remain fixated on old priorities – a lack of vision evident in negotiations over the EU’s 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).
Given that renewable energy is one of the world’s fastest-growing sectors, such investment could have a significant impact on future GDP growth and job creation.
But these tools have not always been used as effectively as possible.
Bargaining between member states leads to lowest-common-denominator budgets that appease vested interests but fail to support EU member states’ shared ambitions.
Missing Growth Multipliers
The April 2010 report forecast a US growth rate of roughly 2.5% annually in 2012-2013; current projections put the rate a little higher than 2%.
The eurozone has been at the epicenter of this contractionary force on global growth.
And, given that this year’s growth has largely already occurred, Germany’s economy has now plateaued – and could even be contracting.
These range from improving information about grain stocks and developing better weather-forecasting methods to strengthening social safety nets for the poor and helping small farmers benefit from tenders from humanitarian purchasers such as the World Food Program.
If managed in ways that are transparent and participatory, and if countries combine their efforts regionally, food reserves can be an effective way to boost sellers’ market power and counteract speculation by traders, thereby limiting price volatility.
By forming cooperatives, they can move up the value chain into the processing, packaging, and marketing of their produce.
And agriculture is also a major culprit in climate change, responsible for 33% of all greenhouse-gas emissions if deforestation for cultivation and pastures is included in the tally.
But what we need more urgently are architects to design a more fire-resistant system.
Even though the global economy today looks relatively robust in general, international economic cooperation is more fragile now than at any moment in the post-1945 world.
Emerging-market policymakers in big countries such as Brazil, China, and Turkey routinely attack the US and its monetary policy as a source of inflation, social tension, and political instability.
The panic about bread that swept France in 1789, and the inability of the government to guarantee supplies, destroyed the ancien regime.
The same kind of unrest, in which the countryside is pitted against the town, with both sides demanding more rights, could undermine the political order in China and other big emerging-market economies.
And some analysts in Seoul believe that a dicey political succession in Pyongyang, combined with food shortages in the countryside, could prove too much for the North Korean regime to handle.
For South Koreans, whether to care for hungry North Koreans, who are kith and kin, will be a much tougher decision than for others who see only a distant security problem.
Will the US take measures to reassure China? How would a unified Korea affect attitudes in Japan?
EU countries subsidized bio-fuels production with €3.7 billion in 2006, and intend to cover 8% of their motor fuels from biological sources by 2015 and 20% by 2020.
The perversity of the first alternative is obvious: there is no surplus food production in the world.
The remaining alternative is to use land that has not previously been used commercially.
This would mean using agricultural and other waste, which would otherwise rot and produce nearly equal amounts of CO2 and methane, an even more dangerous greenhouse gas.
Not many delegates here in Geneva, even from the nuclear-armed states, would disagree with any of these assessments. But it is extraordinary how much of the disembodied calculus of my Woody Allen-lookalike still prevails in today’s nuclear policymaking.
The implications of this stance are profoundly troubling.
It’s that time again: the World Cup is upon us.
The nature of the game encourages this: the speed, the collective aggression.
Clearly, then, whatever de Coubertin might have hoped, cosmopolitanism and cross-cultural brotherhood comes less naturally to human beings than the raw emotions of the tribe.
Tribal emotions are embarrassing, and dangerous when given free reign.
Even though some football games have provoked violence, and in one case even a war, they might have served the positive purpose of containing our more savage impulses by deflecting them onto a mere sport.
As a famous Dutch soccer coach once said, not in jest: “Soccer is war.”
Games between Holland and Germany, for example, or Germany and Poland, tended, until very recently, to be reenactments of the war; either – and most commonly – as melancholy replays of wartime defeat, or as sweet revenge.
When France won the World Cup in 1998, the French liked to point out the ethnic diversity of their team.
Perhaps it was due to the absence of England, whose fans include the last bands of amateur warriors.
But whether “possible” becomes “eventual” remains very much an open question.
Yet this historical evidence is not enough to unite European sentiment in favor of Turkey’s EU membership.
By contrast, Turkey’s large, secular intellectual community, whose cultural background is European, and from which the Turkish state recruits most of its executives, has remained in Istanbul and Ankara.
Indeed, by integrating Turkey, Europe would show that it is not a Christian club, that the supposed “clash of civilizations” need not be fatal, and that the European project, born out of a desire for reconciliation and the need to promote development, can spread its benefits far beyond the Western half of Europe.
And the rest of the world? A global savings glut would suggest that rebalancing the world economy requires policies to boost America’s savings rate and to increase non-US households’ consumption.
People like me who have been cheerleaders for international integration in trade and finance, as well as for reductions in tariffs and other barriers, have cited three benefits:
It would be nice to believe that when the tide of dollar-denominated securities ebbs, the flows of finance currently directed at America will smoothly shift course and boost investment in Asia. But don’t count on it, especially considering the share of marginal investment in Asia that is aimed, one way or another, at exporting to the American market.
There are even deeper similarities.
This time, they hold the better cards.
These regimes can only read the West’s dithering as a green light for their cynical agendas.
The logic of intervention goes through cycles.
Indeed, ignorance seems to be a source of strength for the candidates still in the race.
Foreign visitors to the US often comment that Americans are probably among the most patriotic people in the world, and are becoming much more so.
Even today, America’s economy remains one of its most admired features in the rest of the world – including in China.
Latin America Between Kennan and Obama
This, he argued, had produced a “subconscious recognition of the failure of group efforts,” which manifested itself “in an exaggerated self-centeredness and egotism.”
The US, he believed, should emphasize its position as a great power – one that needed Latin America far less than Latin America needed the US.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in Obama’s recent executive order imposing sanctions on seven mid-level Venezuelan law-enforcement and military officials, who are accused of violating protesters’ rights during last year’s anti-government demonstrations.
The Fed has given ordinary banks direct access to its credit facilities, and the ECB no longer rations the supply of base money, instead providing as much liquidity as banks demand.
It is impossible to infer solely from an increase in the volume of transactions how the price of oil will change.
The most recent data show that the price index in January was up by only 0.9% year on year.
But the ECB, whose only mandate is to maintain price stability, cannot pursue this policy without fundamental changes in legislation.
WARSAW – Some complain that the European Union lacks a “worldview.”
The global financial and economic crisis may also be a catalyst for promoting Europe’s vision of a new world order.
Transferring more areas of responsibility, such as foreign aid and development policies, to EU institutions helps the Union to adapt to new international realities by underpinning its growing importance as Europe’s decision-making center.
EU leaders lament Ukraine’s political divisions and slow pace of reform, and the country’s leaders need to address these criticisms. But lack of progress also reflects the EU’s failure to embrace Ukraine.
MANILA – China’s government has just announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will be the main speaker at the 2009 Boao Forum for Asia, where the roster of leaders expected to participate is a virtual Who’s Who of the continent: President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, President Faure Gnassingbe of Togo, Prime Minister S. Bayar of Mongolia, Prime Minister Thein Sein of Myanmar, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung of Vietnam, Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand, and Kopsak Saphawasu, Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand.
That mission’s highlight was my dialogue with Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, who stressed the importance of connecting Taiwan to the China-ASEAN Free Trade Area (CAFTA) in the light of warmer relations developing between the Mainland and Taiwan.
At this time of worldwide uncertainty, Asia-Pacific leaders must redouble their efforts to exploit their partnerships and strategic combinations in order to foster stability and growth.
But there is a major obstacle to easing tensions: the proposed $6.5 billion sale by the United States to Taiwan of 30 Apache attack helicopters and 330 Patriot missiles.
This may cow some of Syria’s civilian population in the short term, but it will serve only to exacerbate popular rage, and thus to increase the prospect of a bloody reckoning with Assad and his cronies down the line.
But regional and international pressure on Assad has been ineffective. While the Arab League seemed to act decisively last November when it suspended Syria’s membership, the military-observer mission that it sent to Syria was a farce.
Recognizing the opposition as the legitimate government of Syria, as was done in Libya, would give Assad’s foes a boost, but, so far, they lack the gravitas that such a bold measure would require.
Five months later, in Paris, the world’s governments will sign a new global agreement to control human-induced climate change and channel funds toward climate-safe energy, building on the progress achieved earlier this month in negotiations in Lima, Peru.
Perhaps they were just lucky this year, but their divestment decision makes long-term sense, because it correctly anticipates the future policy shift away from fossil fuels and toward low-carbon energy.
Carbon taxes also offer governments a crucial source of revenue for future investment in low-carbon energy.
The math is simple.
Divestment is indeed one answer, for several reasons.
Yet there is also an ethically responsible and practical alternative to divestment that can help steer fossil-fuel companies toward the low-carbon future.
In 1990, Harvard divested completely from tobacco companies.
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the company agree to end any exploration and development of unconventional reserves (for example, in the Arctic and much of the Canadian oil sands) that science has shown to be inconsistent with the 2º limit?
What the data do show are economic ills rooted in the values and beliefs of Greek society.
The result is that competition for market share is weak and there are few firms with new ideas.
Greece’s much-lauded shipowners, for example, were too slow to adapt to containerization, and thus lost their market share.
Thus, Greece went from boom to outright slump.
NEW YORK – The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen this year will be the moment in history when humanity can rise to the challenge and decisively deal with the issue.
First, clarity is needed on ambitious, legally binding emission-reduction targets for industrialized countries.
The magnitude of action by developing countries will largely depend on the effective delivery of finance and clean technology through international cooperative action.
If significant financial resources are to be generated for mitigation and adaptation, developing countries will want a representative say in how that money is to be allocated and spent.
The organization with which I was longest and most closely associated, the International Crisis Group (ICG), is an unusual combination of all three categories. It is field-based in a way that most operational organizations are, but that think tanks and advocacy organizations are not.
The most successful tend to be those that find a clear niche and stick to it.
Four Steps to US Fiscal Health
Moreover, the US should look hard at tax breaks that act like hidden spending programs.
As the IMF argues, if applied across the G-20, a Financial Activities Tax would help constrain the worst features of the financial system and reduce the competitive distortions created by the megabanks.
This year’s health-care reform legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a starting point.
As prices rise, people don’t want to hold cash in their pockets or their bank accounts – its value is melting away every day – so they step up the pace at which they spend, trying to get their wealth out of depreciating cash and into real assets that are worth something.
With fewer safe, money-yielding assets in the financial market, the price of safe wealth rises.
No one is willing to buy assets and take on additional uncertainty, because everyone fears that somebody else knows more than they do – namely, that anyone would be a fool to buy.
Even before French President Charles de Gaulle took office in 1958, he foresaw the wave of revolutionary nationalism that would soon sweep across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.
The ensuing economic difficulties were exacerbated under President François Mitterrand, whose prime minister, Pierre Bérégovoy, pursued a strong French franc – a policy that ultimately led to a massive 100% devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994.
With the establishment of ECOWAS, the Franc Zone countries created two sub-regional groupings, WAEMU and CEMAC, in a bid to curb British, American, and Nigerian influence. As a result, West African countries are mostly missing out on Africa’s current revival – and the prospect of a prolonged period of stagnation in the eurozone certainly won’t help.
Now he considers it the best currency in the world.
In his book Changer de destin (Changing Destiny), published in February, he affirms that France’s message will continue to be a universal one – a stance reminiscent of the birth in 1789 of the French Republic, which, like the United States, was originally conceived as the triumph of liberty and democracy.
Last but not least, Hollande is not likely to call into question Sarkozy’s decision in 2009 to reintegrate France into NATO’s military command.
While Merkel opposes Hollande’s proposal to create Eurobonds with a view to financing industrial projects, they cannot afford to waste time in reassuring jittery markets with a message of cohesion.
LONDON – France’s new president, François Hollande, has achieved a remarkable series of political victories – at home and in Europe – since his election in May.
France’s current-account deficit has risen to more than 2% of GDP, even as its economic growth has ground to a halt.
The idea behind the policy is that demand for labor is a constant, and that this fixed number of aggregate working hours required by employers to meet final demand can be spread more evenly among workers to reduce unemployment.
For mainstream French politicians, renouncing the European project to buy the time required to restore competitiveness is as unthinkable as is the logical alternative: an all-out push for full European political union.
Advances in prevention and treatment have reduced annual HIV infections by one-third over the past decade, and cut AIDS-related deaths by 30% over the past five years.
Infection rates continue to rise in specific regions and populations, and more than half of the people living with HIV worldwide do not even know that they have it.
The second group are “elite controllers,” who can carry HIV for ten years or more without treatment and without falling ill.
Next week, President Bush, President Chirac, and Chancellor Schroeder will meet on the cliffs of Normandy to mark the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasions that led to the liberation of Europe.
Instead of the rule of law, there would be the law of the mafia, of terrorist groups, and of tribal militias.
At the very least, France and Germany are demanding that the Bush administration openly admit to its failure and the need for help.
But France and Germany can also block European responsibility for international order and for solidarity with a US facing possible defeat in Iraq.
The debate revolves around two major issues: austerity and integration.
And here, the EU has made three mistakes.
This would help significantly in mapping out a sensible rebalancing strategy.
Time and again, banks’ woes have affected governments’ borrowing costs, and concerns over governments’ solvency have affected banks’ balance sheets.
With growth barely visible, and dangerously low inflation causing real interest rates to rise, the weight of public and private debt has grown very heavy, and many fear that another lost decade is at hand.
So action is needed on all three fronts.
The European Commission has proposed a plan to stimulate investment spending through a new financing scheme, one that we hope will succeed.
In energy, transport, and the digital sector, to name just a few, regulators must set the right parameters and ensure predictability.
We propose injecting new European public money into the development of risk-sharing instruments and vehicles that support equity investment.
PARIS – France has now conducted its ninth presidential election under direct universal suffrage.
In fact, when François Mitterand was elected in 1981, the left had been out of power since 1957.
On the contrary, the left’s return to power appears to be an entirely normal, almost trivial, example of alternation in government.
A social and political correction was necessary, and it has occurred with a vengeance unique to France.
The Socialists can govern without limits, so it is up to them to govern well.
Hungarians and Romanians, after nine centuries of hatred and wars, are embarking on the same process. Greece has just decided to support the opening of negotiations for Turkey’s entry into the EU in the next twelve years.
If it does, the result will be an earthquake.
It smacks of usurpation and is inciting many of the French to vote their anger.
The debate in France is still raging, and nothing is yet lost.
Some French see the EU as a community where national interests inexorably converge. At the other extreme is the Gaullist belief that the EU is nothing more than a “power multiplier” for France to defend its own national interests.
He will need to demonstrate that France no longer treats Europe as a scapegoat for its own economic troubles – a ploy that merely marginalizes France in economic debates. Thus, polemics against the European Central Bank’s independence and the damaging effect of “the high euro” will have to stop.
Next, France and the EU must find a new model for dealing with Russia. Here, the Union is confronted with a dilemma.
One month to the day after terrorists killed 130 people in Paris, the French once again demonstrated clear-eyed stoicism.
They might use the first ballot to express their anger at the government and discontent with the system, but they know that the FN is made up of incompetent extremists.
The country’s pride and sense of mission, inherited from the Ancien Régime and reinforced by the French Revolution, may not have prevented collaboration with Nazi Germany under the Vichy government; but it took a disastrous defeat to force France to bend its knee to the far right.
A European political union could also make Europe a power comparable to the United States, and thereby give France, with its sophisticated foreign service, an important role in European and world affairs.
The pro-euro politicians ignored economists’ warnings that imposing a single currency on a dozen heterogeneous countries was bound to create serious economic problems.
Spain was the first to insist that it could not meet the conditions to which it had just agreed, and other countries will soon follow.
If we are to see a stronger Europe emerge from today’s challenges, visionary French leadership is needed again.
Only by reinforcing open trading and financial relations across Europe can we hope to subdue today’s crisis.
To believe that such a vision can work for Russia, Ukraine, and Europe is not wishful thinking, but rests on the successful experience of France and Germany in promoting amity.
Yes, these are dark times, and all politicians want to protect their voters.
Bayrou criticizes the “nationalist obsession” of his competitors, but he supports abrogating the jus soli (the right to obtain French nationality by birth) for people from the French island of Mayotte, owing to massive inflows of pregnant women to the island.
The identity crisis now roiling France is fueled by the conjunction of many factors: globalization, which produces uncertainty, the European Union, which curtails the freedom of national leaders, American strategic dominance, which has reduced France’s position in the world, and the rising Asian powers.
Today’s debate over national identity arises from this tension, so it’s not surprising that it has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
France is currently one of Europe’s laggards, only slightly ahead of Italy and Portugal.
By 2008, the French rate can be expected to decline only to 8.2%, while German unemployment is anticipated to fall to 6.3%.
Small wonder, then, that Germany’s economy rockets when the world’s demand for capital goods soars.
The French government share in GDP is 54%, while Germany’s is only 47%.
All candidates should be known by the end of January – the deadline for printing the ballots.
Preaching privatization and social repression, he has placed himself to the right of the right, hoping to take back the votes that the mainstream right has been losing to Jean-Marie Le Pen’s “fascistoid” National Front for the past 20 years.
Ever since de Gaulle, all candidates for the French presidency who started too early have lost.
A repeat of this scenario seems possible: on the left, outside of the Socialist Party, there are already four announced candidates, and a fifth is likely.
Until recently, Royal – who now is merely the head of one France’s 22 regional governments – was best known as the non-married partner of François Hollande, the Socialist Party leader.
But, while other politicians do not regard these matters as politically important, they mean a lot to most ordinary citizens.
Even though, like the majority of France’s political class, she was educated at Ecole Nationale d’Administration (ENA), she spurns the language and habits of this elite factory.
Few voters will support someone whose political program is based only on education and defense of the family.
France’s Third Man
In the 2002 presidential election, frustration with the system fueled strong support for the extremes, with Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the far right, qualifying for the second-round runoff.
So it is too early to say whether Bayrou can reach the second round.
France is a marvelously paradoxical country, so the search for novelty, if not modernity, could lead to the reinvention of the Fourth Republic, a parliamentary regime characterized by its weaknesses and instability.
जीएम फसलें (जिन्हें आनुवांशिक रूप से इंजिनीयर्ड या बायोटेक्नोलॉजी फसलें भी कहा जाता है) बार-बार सुरक्षित साबित हुई हैं और सारी दुनिया में कृषि उत्पादकता बढ़ाने में उनका सफलतापूर्वक इस्तेमाल किया जाता है. पर नौकरशाही, दुष्प्रचार और गुमराह करने वाली सूचना लाखों अफ्रीकी किसानों को, जिनमें केन्या के किसान भी शामिल हैं, उस तकनीकी तक पहुंच बनाने से रोकती है जो उनके जीवन स्तर को सुधार सकती है और भोजन की कमी को दूर करने में मददगार है.
कृषि तकनीकी अपनाने में अगुआ बन कर केन्या के किसान भी समान लाभ ले सकेंगे इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं. केन्या में एक-तिहाई खाद्य उत्पादन छोटे किसानों द्वारा किया जाता है. ये वही किसान हैं जो दुनिया में 90% जीएम फसलें उपजाते हैं. केन्या वासी उम्मीद है कि कीट-प्रतिरोधी मक्का जैसी नई जीएम किस्मों को उगा कर भारी लाभ ले सकते हैं जिनका स्थानीय वैज्ञानिकों द्वारा विकास किया जा रहा है.
यही कारण है कि फसल की नई किस्मों के स्वास्थ्य व सुरक्षा के बारे में निर्णय वैज्ञानिक प्रमाणों पर आधारित होने चाहिए ना कि उनके बारे में राजनीतिक पूर्वाग्रहों और निराधार ‘नैतिक’ तर्कों से फैसला लिया जाए. नीति निर्धारण में प्रमाण-आधारित रवैया अपना कर केन्या के अधिकारीगण अपने देश में लाखों जीवन सुधार सकते हैं और समूचे महाद्वीप के लिए एक अमूल्य मिसाल भी कायम कर सकते हैं.
Traditionally, British law imposed two main limitations on the “right to free speech.” The first prohibited the use of words or expressions likely to disrupt public order; the second was the law against libel.
France has made it illegal to deny any “internationally recognized crimes against humanity.”
Restrictions on certain areas of historical inquiry are based on the opposite premise: the truth is known, and it is impious to question it.
It has become taboo to describe homosexuality as a “perversion,” though this was precisely the word used in the 1960’s by the radical philosopher Herbert Marcuse (who was praising homosexuality as an expression of dissent).
You know that a doctrine is in trouble when not even those claiming to defend it understand what it means.
In one episode, a trainer fell into the pool and Tilly and two other whales drowned him.
David Phillips, director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, which led the efforts to rehabilitate the orca Keiko – made famous by the movie Free Willy – said “Orcas deserve a better fate than living in cramped pools.”
That decision followed an undercover investigation by Animal Defenders International, which exposed shocking abuse of circus animals.
Until our governments take action, we should avoid supporting places where captive wild animals perform for our amusement.
When the Doha trade round was launched shortly after September 11, 2001, there was plenty of international goodwill. But disenchantment with globalization – and, in some regions, fear of immigration– has since set in.
Moreover, the long-term impact of free trade is huge.
Moreover, it may well hurt other poor countries – thereby worsening inequality – by encouraging resources to be allocated to activities that become uncompetitive following the next World Trade Organization agreement.
The economic logic is compelling: removing trade and migration barriers would be an exceptionally wise investment.
Highly skilled and better-educated respondents tend to be considerably more pro-free trade than blue-collar workers are.
Even more opposed the change.
But what about technological innovation, which, like trade, often leaves some people worse off. Here, few students would condone blocking technological progress.
That is a key reason why we believe that technological progress should run its course, despite its short-run destructive effects on some.
Free Trade Breakdown
Portugal could produce wine cheaply, whereas Great Britain could produce cloth much more cheaply than wine.
Anderson showed that if developing countries cut their tariffs by the same proportion as high-income countries, and services and investment were also liberalized, the annual global gains could climb to $120 billion, with $17 billion going to the world's poorest countries by 2015.
South Korea liberalized trade in 1965, Chile in 1974, and India in 1991; all saw annual growth rates increase by several percentage points thereafter.
Still, there are few celebrity campaigners calling on politicians to sort out the Doha Round.
While a nation has a clear interest in the benefits of free and open trade, it also has a vital interest in its citizens’ safety.
In a safer world, the deal would go unnoticed – and rightfully so.
This would mean a loss for the US, because, sooner or later, some of the efficiency gains achieved by the Dubai firm would be passed on to US ports in the form of higher lease payments.
As the United States Congress begins to debate the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), a titanic struggle between the forces of free trade and protectionism promises to unfold.
The US exported paddy rice, for example, at a price almost 20% lower than the cost of production in 2003, making it impossible for Central Americans to compete.
Although trade with Central America represents only about 1.5% of total US trade, the outcome of the debate on DR-CAFTA will shape US trade policy – which sets the tone for other rich countries’ stance in trade talks – for years to come.
Smart trade creates balanced development, while polarizing trade rewards a small circle of winners at the expense of the many.
So almost all of Latin America is deeply affected by the current immigration climate in the US, and would benefit greatly from the type of comprehensive immigration reform that both John McCain and Barack Obama have supported. The Bush administration’s regrettable decision to build fences along the US-Mexico border, raid workplaces and housing sites, detain and deport foreigners without papers, is viewed in Latin America as being hypocritical and offensive.
The pressure to include similar provisions in the other deals would then grow.
These revised agreements should include bold, enlightened provisions for infrastructure and “social-cohesion” funds, since these can make the difference between muddling through and true success.
This time, the film that triggered riots in Cairo, Benghazi, Sana, and elsewhere is so crude and inflammatory as to seem clearly intended to elicit the outrage that it produced.
This does not diminish the irresponsibility of those who gratuitously engage in such offensive behavior, but it does make clear that outrage against their actions should not be a basis for abandoning our commitment to freedom of expression.
Twenty years ago this month, Mikhail Gorbachev began his policies of perestroika and glasnost , which led to the end of the Cold War.
This revival of the past was a big worry for West Europeans and Americans, who feared the re-emergence of historical enmities and tensions, which did indeed come to the fore in the former Yugoslavia.
His governors are also like Nicholas’s; many are governor-generals. The capitalism now being practiced is dependent on the authorities, and plays no independent role in politics.
If Russia is to move forward, its high and mighty must agree about who owns what, who makes the rules, and how to change the rules.
This calls for a kind of liberalism that is now lacking in Russia, one that stands for freedom, reform, and the nation-state.
Indeed, his arrest on March 22 is compelling evidence of the truth of his testimony about the regime’s nature, and of the danger that it poses to Venezuelans, whose freedoms apparently are being systematically stripped, and to Latin American more broadly, owing to Chávez’s example to other would-be autocrats.
It is the legalism of the barbarian, and the instinctive political philosophy of all who are in revolt against democratic norms of behavior.
It is not too late to recall Venezuela to the camp of free and democratic nations.
Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, said that that body saw the resolution as weakening “the rights of individuals to express their views.”
Coincidentally, in the same week that Germany and the World Jewish Congress rejected the idea that defamation of religion is an affront to human dignity, and upheld the right to freedom of expression, Germany’s highest court issued its ruling on a case brought by a Jewish organization, and two Jewish individuals.
If, on the other hand, a religion’s adherents have no right to protection against criticism of their religion, then, even in Germany, Holocaust victims and their descendants (I am one) should not be protected against advertising campaigns that, though not intended to incite hatred or violence, may cause them offense.
Israelis understand that the only reality in politics is the reality on the ground.
The creation of new settlements has often been accompanied by hostile media reporting – even within Israel – as well as international condemnation, yet the settlement train has not stopped. It continued to race ahead even during the days when Israel’s government rotated between Likud’s Yitzhak Shamir and Labor’s Shimon Peres between 1984 and 1990.
Of course, whenever the Israelis defy the world over the settlements, as is now once again happening, US and other officials “denounce” and “regret” the decision.
To those on the right, France’s oversized and intrusive government offers only a blueprint for secular decline.
The effective workweek for most workers is perhaps closer to 39 hours.
Still, France’s supersize government is hardly a source of unalloyed dynamism.
Another obstacle to applying the French model elsewhere is that France enjoys certain unique advantages that are arguably critical to its success.
Milton Friedman was not the most famous and influential economist in the world -- that honor belongs to John Maynard Keynes.
Friedman, in a 30-year campaign starting with his and Anna J. Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the United States , restored the balance.
It was simply not the case, Keynes argued, that the private incentives of those active in the marketplace were aligned with the public good.
I do not know whether Keynes or Friedman was more right in their deep orientation.
This interpretation makes a certain kind of sense, but it relies on a critical assumption.
In this case, the contamination was so bad that policymakers were unwilling to go beyond Friedman and apply Keynesian and Minskyite policies on a large enough scale to address the problems that the Great Recession presented.
By contrast, in terms of creativity, Latin American flair shines well beyond Brazil and its confirmed emerging-power status in the world to encompass countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, and even Chile.
The French team’s performance may reflect the mood of the country, but the failure of France’s international stars to jell reflected, above all, a total absence of leadership at the helm.
In 2010, “The rise and fall of Les Bleus” can be interpreted as an accelerated version of Gibbon’s study of the decline of the Roman Empire.
From 9/11 to the Arab Spring
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) emerged in late 2002 as a force in Saudi Arabia, orchestrating a spectacular attack in Riyadh in 2003.
The model works by propagating a narrative describing the severe injustices and humiliation suffered by Muslims, advancing an ideology that identifies the means to remove the grievances, and then letting sympathizers recruit themselves to Al Qaeda or initiate their own operations.
Several of its factions still uphold armed tactics, including terrorism.
From Cairo to California
Reagan captured this assumption well, recalling the sixth-century BC Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu’s famous words: “Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish: too much handling will spoil it.”
In an April 2008 article in The Financial Times, he wrote, “Bank loan officers, in my experience, know far more about the risks and workings of their counterparties than do bank regulators.”
With a heavy and stifling bureaucracy and the prospect of a dynastic political succession, sheer lack of hope drove hundreds of thousands of Egyptians onto the streets.
There must be some principles of good government that China has developed.
This is the doctrine of “lender-of-last-resort.”
Then they freed themselves of all but the lightest contact with their political masters: they became independent technocrats, a monetary priesthood that spoke in Delphic terms obscure to mere mortals.
And it is this rise in risk premia that threatens to send the global economy into a deep recession, and turn the financial markets from a spectacle of schadenfreude into a malign source of unemployment and idle factories worldwide.
State prosecutors alleged that the party was trying to “Islamicize” the country and ultimately introduce theocracy.
The Vatican, having prohibited Italian Catholics from participating in the political life of newly united Italy for almost sixty years, lifted its ban.
After the fall of France, Maritain decided to remain in the US, where he happened to find himself after a lecture tour (the Gestapo searched his house outside Paris in vain).
Nevertheless, some body of thought that makes democracy attractive for believers – and reassures non-believers that the faithful have accepted pluralism – had to be available.  True, some of the philosophies used in the European Catholic transition to democracy – such as personalism – were rather nebulous, although it was probably their vagueness that helped to bring as many believers as possible on board.
Realizing that economics cannot be neatly separated from politics, APEC soon began to include security issues in its agenda.
APEC members, too, should use the existing umbrella of Pax Americana to accelerate economic, security, and political integration before new rivalries emerge to thwart their efforts.
Clearly, Pax Asia-Pacifica must be built on an unswerving commitment to peace among APEC's most powerful countries – the US, China, and Japan.
America’s Trouble with China
History teaches us that rising powers inevitably compete with status quo leading powers, and that this conflict often leads to war.
Perhaps the best way to avoid confrontation is to cooperate on shared external threats, most notably nuclear proliferation, global climate change, and Islamic extremism. But getting to 2030 without a major confrontation will be a major achievement.
De Gaulle’s agenda was very different: he wanted to rewrite the Constitution and to found a new “Fifth Republic” for France.
The French have seldom been enamored of democracy.
Parliament is weak, the judiciary is under executive control, the media is kept under surveillance, and there is no constitutional guarantee of free speech.
The exception may be the military and the diplomatic service: following de Gaulle’s lead, all French presidents have financed the military generously.
It holds elections, but more as a nod to modernity than to represent the people’s will.
Forests ensure water supplies, counter soil erosion, and safeguard an abundance of genetic resources that will become increasingly important in developing the new products, pharmaceuticals, and crop strains needed to support the lives and livelihoods of more than nine billion people by 2050.
Brazil has reduced deforestation rates in the Amazon by roughly 80% since 2005, and Norway’s pledge of $1 billion is helping to achieve further reductions.
Governance and land-tenure systems must be improved in many countries, and the risk of corruption must be addressed rigorously.
With a price tag of around $40 billion per year, the cost of that support is, to be frank, a bargain.
Enthusiasm for what are usually enjoyable activities fades.
During a period of crisis in which someone becomes depressed and suicidal, an association is learned between the various symptoms (low mood, physical pain, suicidal tendencies, and so on).
It helps break the normal link between negative mood and negative thinking.
NEW YORK – The rich world’s financial system is headed towards meltdown.
The crisis was caused by the largest leveraged asset bubble and credit bubble in history.
Until the recent US and European measures were announced, there were no rallies at all.
• a temporary blanket guarantee of all deposits while insolvent financial institutions that must be shut down are distinguished from distressed but solvent institutions that must be partially nationalized and given injections of public capital; 
MOSCOW – In Russia, 2010 ended with an unprecedented upsurge of ultra-nationalist violence.
The beatings continued and spread to the subway, where the police were essentially powerless.
The government had erected the TV screens outside the Kremlin in order to ensure patriotic exultation of the victory that they assumed was coming.
Indeed, by coincidence, on the Sunday the young football fan was murdered in Moscow, Vladislav Surkov, the first deputy in President Dmitri Medvedev’s administration, was meeting Michael McFaul of President Barack Obama’s National Security Council.
That is why the police fail to take tough action against rioting young thugs.
While rapid growth in developing countries has been an important factor in the rising commodity prices, much of this is beyond their control.
Much has become clear.
Absent international coordination, the opportunities for destructive regulatory competition will defeat regulatory reform.
It may also provide an economic springboard for another two billion people to fulfill their aspirations in the coming decades.
A time-out needs to be called so that the players, including President-elect Barack Obama, can negotiate a new bargain for the region.
This is why Obama must adopt a bold diplomatic initiative that encompasses the entire region and help resolve longstanding disputes between Afghanistan’s neighbors.
Pressure will not work if Pakistan’s leaders believe that their country’s survival is at stake.
But the Lisbon treaty has instead brought chaos to the Union.
First, it could stick with the Nice treaty as the basis of the Union’s operation.
Instead, it is a simplified treaty replete with protocols, dispensations, and opt-out causes.
The disappearance from the treaty of such terms as “constitution” and “minister of foreign affairs” clearly show that the constitutional treaty’s ambitions have been scaled back.
Kafka, the reclusive and visionary Central European writer, gave his name to the twentieth century.
The fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, surprisingly accepted by Mikhail Gorbachev, meant immediate and direct support in reconstructing East Germany’s institutions and economy.
Unavoidably, old-new clichés emerged.
And liberal capitalism itself – with its mediocre political leaders and cartoonish public discourse – has become a poor advertisement for the Absolute Idea.
From Karl Popper to Karl Rove – and Back
In other areas, such as science and industry, the impulse to impose one’s views on the world encounters the resistance of external reality.
Politicians will respect, rather than manipulate, reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliber­ate deception.
One influential technique – which Republican pollster Frank Luntz says that he learned from 1984 - simply reverses meanings and turns reality on its head.
Americans are now awakening, as if from a bad dream.
She has carefully studied not only Jackie Kennedy – a comparison obvious from her sheath dresses, boat collars, and page-boy haircut – but also the triumphs and failures of that other glamorous but underestimated stealth radical, Princess Diana.
So, what Michelle Obama is doing is not trivial.
They had learned nothing from the right, whose candidates knew how powerful the right colors, clothing, imagery, and even lighting can be, and how strongly personal narratives – Ronald Reagan in riding boots, or George W. Bush in a flight suit – resonate with voters.
It is liberal, and despises any sort of fanaticism, whether orthodox or nationalist.
They, too, would like life, pragmatism, creativity, and even joy to gain the upper hand.
The gravest problem for Middle Israel is the Palestinian predicament in the occupied West Bank and in deadlocked Gaza.
Paralleling Middle Israel, though perhaps not initially befriending it or liking it very much, this kind of Palestine will be the best news that the Middle East will have had for a long time.
After all, how can the US or the Western multilateral institutions advocate bank privatization now?
As the global agenda shifted to concerns about global warming, inequality, and the stability of the international system, the US no longer seemed to be a shining example, but rather an immovable obstacle on many of these issues.
Various forms of statism have been tried before; all have been found lacking.
Sheikh Yamani, Saudi Arabia’s former oil minister and a founding architect of OPEC, once said, “The stone age came to an end not for a lack of stones, and the oil age will end, but not for a lack of oil.”
By September 1990, each of the metals had dropped in price: chromium by 5%, tin by a whopping 74%.
So, if oil substitutes are not easily available, modern societies should focus on the sources of demand, most of which is attributable to the transport sector.
But, given the high-speed data transmission capacities of current telecommunications and information technology, it is now possible to reduce business travel significantly. Whereas the outsourcing phenomenon is attenuating the need for labor migration, domestic migration can be limited further by the use of home offices, which can eventually reduce stress on real estate, public transport networks, roads, and airports.
The 1936 Berlin Olympics were dominated as much by Nazi propaganda as by the athletic events.
The Chinese today sound almost as stunned by the supposed mistreatment of the Olympic torch in London, Paris, and San Francisco as Americans were back in 2001: “Why do they hate us so much?” “What have we done to them?”
But selective responses to the actions of dictatorships can be problematic and counterproductive.
His unwillingness to jettison terror and choose diplomacy proved his undoing, as he lost legitimacy in the eyes of both Israel and the United States.
Middle East history is replete with examples of missed and lost chances to make peace.
It is also important that the Gaza withdrawal be a beginning, not an end, to the political process.
The US should not, however, make the establishment of a full Palestinian democracy a prerequisite for territorial return and peace.
Imagine a country that increases its imports of, say, cars and other consumer goods by 10% of its starting GDP.
But retail shop clerks and car dealers cannot be easily transformed into the specialized and highly skilled workers needed in modern manufacturing.
It took Germany ten years (until about 2005) of slow growth to reduce capacity in the construction sector and gain market share for its export industry.
The debt crisis will end only when they have shown that they have understood this and accepted the inevitable sacrifices.
But has Europe’s financial aid brought peace any closer? The Palestinian Authority has received more aid per capita than did post-war Europe under the Marshall Plan, yet the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have foiled hopes of a broader Euro-Mediterranean framework that, through dialogue and investment, would bring tangible improvements to the lives of millions.
The complementarities between countries rich in human resources and oil-producing states should be harnessed, while energy-derived investment must be diverted from the old markets of the West to the Gulf’s troubled hinterland.
Europe’s contributions to the Middle East have been great.
The portraits of Politkovskaya, like a multitude of mirrors, were calling us back to a much darker reality.
Of course, the differences between Russia and Iran are enormous.
The war in Chechnya may contribute to the moral corruption of Russia as a whole, to its frightening descent into a culture of violence. But it is also feeding a patriotic emotion – a popular longing for the restoration of Russia’s imperial status and prestige – that Putin’s regime has shrewdly exploited.
Even Poland’s communist newspapers, read behind bars, somehow conveyed news of the great changes taking place in our neighbor to the south.
The main difference between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution was that the former was mostly the work of Communist Party members and others who wanted to bring about “socialism with a human face.”
But in both countries, 1968 gave birth to a new political consciousness.
But it is surprising when these people accuse participants in the Prague Spring and the democratic opposition of links with communism.
After all, taxing natural resources at high rates will not cause them to disappear, which means that countries whose major source of revenue is natural resources can use them to finance education, health care, development, and redistribution.
There is an unavoidable conflict of interest between (usually foreign) natural-resource companies and host countries: the former want to minimize what they pay, while the latter need to maximize it.
Even the United States has imposed a windfall-profits tax.
Forty years ago, South Korea had a comparative advantage in growing rice.
One of the late Pope John Paul II’s unfulfilled dreams was to visit Moscow and forge a rapprochement with the Orthodox Church.
No less a figure than Alexander Pushkin wrote in 1836 that “Orthodoxy has always been persecuted by Catholic fanaticism….Their missionaries cursed the Orthodox Church, with hypocrisy and threats tried to recruit into Catholicism not only ordinary people but Orthodox priests as well.”
Putin, in particular, is at home in the German language, having spent many years in East Germany during his days as a KGB agent.
In Japan, the Koizumi government wants to privatize the behemoth postal service, whose giant financial arm is wrapped like a python around the country’s banking system.
You can tell Latin Americans or Africans that Asia’s unquenchable thirst for natural resources will keep pushing up the prices of their commodity and agricultural exports in perpetuity, turning wheat fields into gold mines.
Clothing makers in Italy have long been the envy of the world.
Will today’s reform paralysis outside Asia continue?
In factories as well, Party bureaucrats wanted to know everything and decide everything.
Some passionately discussed economic reform, others talked about developing culture, while still others planned to reform education and the scientific establishment or assure the defense of the environment.
It was an institution committed to respecting the integrity of all individuals and all other institutions.
True, Poland’s democratic institutions, despite their flaws, function rather well.
But was it really inevitable that so much solidarity had to escape our Solidarity?

लेकिन अनेक विकासशील देश घरेलू बचत की कमी के कारण नहीं, बल्कि निवेश की माँग की कमी के कारण विवश हैं। सामाजिक निवेश पर लाभ ऊँचे हो सकते हैं, लेकिन निजी लाभ कम होते हैं, जिसका कारण बाहरी कारक, उच्च कर, ख़राब संस्थाएँ, या अन्य अनेक कारकों में से कोई भी हो सकता है।
ऐसी दुनिया में, पूँजीगत नियंत्रणों को, हमेशा और हर जगह, अंतिम उपाय मानने का औचित्य बहुत कम है; वास्तव में, यह वित्तीय भूमंडलीकरण को केवल अधिक आकर्षक बनाता है। यह मानते हुए कि पूँजी नियंत्रण को कभी-कभी प्रमुख स्थान दिए जाने की ज़रूरत होती है, दुनिया को अलग-अलग मामले में, अत्यधिक व्यवहारकुशल होने की ज़रूरत है ।
But reality has proven such assessments to be both biased and hopelessly wrong.
The International Energy Agency’s 2010 World Energy Outlook foresees a rise in global energy demand of 40% by 2030 – an unforgiving reality that is most tangibly felt in developing countries, particularly in Asia.
But they should not be alone.
But the similarity between the two types of crisis ends where preventing their recurrence begins.
Financial players use derivatives to transfer risk: one player assumes the risk of, say, euro fluctuation, but doesn’t want yen risk, while for another, it’s the opposite.
In the US, the main design defects are in bankruptcy law, which exempts derivatives and repos from most regular bankruptcy constraints.
If investors in derivatives, repos, and credit-default swaps lacked favored treatment, they would behave differently.
But these rules don’t address the main problem: the weakened incentives for market discipline for core financial institutions.
Assembling new data is essential to scientific progress.
The coexistence of disparate ideas cultivates competition and progress.
The recent discovery of the Higgs boson was the culmination of a programmatic experimental effort to confirm a theoretical idea, proposed in the 1960s, that lies at the foundation of the standard model of particle physics.

The Global Fund’s remarkable successes result from its operational procedures.
Unfortunately, the Global Fund is already in a state of fiscal crisis.
Many countries – including France, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States – have recently recognized the need to move beyond the financing of control of AIDS, TB, and malaria to financing improvements in primary health systems more generally.
Wall Street bankers, whose poor performance did so much damage to the world economy in recent years, and who still are reaping excessive bonuses, would also begin to make amends by seeing their new tax payments contribute to saving the lives of millions in the coming years.
Debtor governments should call upon their own taxpayers to fund some of the national debt in order to avoid higher interest rates in credit markets.
Escaping the euro crisis is less a matter of economics than of political will.
The measures described can be scaled up if a bigger target becomes necessary.
A carbon tax on international shipping and aviation set at the same level (or auction revenues from emissions caps, if that pricing route is followed) could generate $10 billion annually for international climate action from just 25-50% of the revenues, even after ensuring that costs borne by developing countries are covered.
The MDBs have learned from experience how to use resources well.
To peek into the future, all we have to do is go to Beijing, Athens, Tokyo, or, in fact, just about any city on Earth.
There are even more dramatic increases in Tokyo.
But we have an opportunity to act.
By increasing reflection and shade, a great deal of heat build-up can be avoided.
But, despite all of these meetings – high-profile events involving top decision-makers from the world’s most influential economies – no real progress has been made toward reforming the international financial architecture.
The necessary institutional arrangement already exists: the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) department.
The Bank for International Settlements, which was the counterparty in currency swaps under the Bretton Woods par value system in the 1960s, could be the manager of this system.
Instead, foreign-exchange reserves – that is, liquidity in currencies accepted for international payments – are held in national agencies until a swap’s activation.
ANKARA – As France and the world mourn the terrorist slaughter of innocents in Paris, the leaders of the G-20 are meeting in Antalya, Turkey.
G-20 members should expedite efforts to deliver on their commitments to boost productivity and eliminate structural bottlenecks to investment, competition, trade, and jobs.
Reducing unemployment is central to the fight against inequality. There are about 100 million jobless people in the G-20, and another 200 million young people who are neither working nor studying.
The Syrian civil war – now well into its fourth year – must be brought to an end, and a fair and sustainable political transition must be ensured.
The G-20 Summit in Antalya will address these and other major issues confronting the world.
This year, the clear first choice has to be the 1963 James Bond spy thriller “From Russia with Love.”
Bush’s reaction is less predictable.
Rather than making really substantive improvements in the quantity and quality of aid delivery, not to mention finding a path towards better governance in Africa, they chose a desperate plea for photo ops with Bono and Angelina Jolie.
Russia has been vying for the West’s esteem for centuries, with approval by the French – a sought-after prize since the time of Peter the Great – coveted the most.
Indeed, in the 1830’s, two Frenchmen, Alexis de Tocqueville and Custine, went to the outskirts of civilization to describe the future superpower rivals, America and Russia.
He was portly Porthos in Alexander Dumas’s classic The Three Musketeers (in 1998’s The Man in the Iron Mask), and played the lead in the film version of Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac (1990), which is almost as popular with Russians as Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin.
Indeed, not long after Depardieu’s change of allegiance, a French icon of an even older vintage, Brigitte Bardot, suggested that she, too, might embrace Russia.
One of them comes with this week’s G-20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, where leaders of the world’s advanced and major emerging economies can signal serious intent by cutting the fossil-fuel subsidies that fuel global warming.
According to the International Energy Agency, no more than one-third of known reserves can be exploited if this goal is to be achieved.
Subsidies for fossil-fuel exploration are where the politics of the greenhouse meets the economics of the madhouse.
If we are to keep within the 2ºC threshold, governments should be putting a high and escalating price on carbon, linked to emission-reduction targets.
Indeed, the Australian authorities have tried to keep the issue off the agenda altogether.
The tone set by Murdoch, however, suggests that a consensus on sustainable, inclusive growth will be hard to achieve.
The bigger challenge, though, is hitting those growth targets in a sustainable and inclusive way.
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde recently put it more starkly, noting that the world’s 85 richest people control more wealth than the world’s 3.5 billion poorest people, and that this degree of inequality is casting a dark shadow over the global economy.
The value of an investment is based largely on the perception of how risky it is.
Second, governments must lead by example.
The Irrelevant Seven
Indeed, America’s technological lead – together with its enormous capital assets and dynamic business culture, exemplified in Silicon Valley – could ultimately reinforce its global standing.
That leaves only the US and China.
“Security of property and tolerable administration of justice,” as Smith put it.
For Smith and his successors over the first 175 years, any episode of sustained economic growth overwhelmingly required investment capital.
Indeed, high investment serves as a sign that other binding constraints to growth are absent, implying prosperity and that things are going right.
Nevertheless, a dispassionate observer might point out that for someone with limited resources and opportunities for policy reform to keep betting double-or-nothing on neo-liberalism is a strategy that has a well-deserved name: “Gambler’s Ruin.”
We now know that they deluded not only the rest of society, but even themselves.
Ratings agencies had incentives to give good ratings to the high-risk securities produced by the investment banks that were paying them.
Incentive structures that encourage excess risk-taking remain virtually unchanged.
In the end, those gambling in Las Vegas lose more than they gain.
Hobbled by the self-inflicted wounds of the debt-ceiling debacle in the summer of 2011 – which undermined economic growth and job creation, and further damaged Americans’ confidence in their political system – the US Congress and President Barack Obama’s administration recognized the need for a measured and rational approach to fiscal reform.
The cost-benefit calculations will likely evolve after the election in November.
Moreover, the potential impact certainly is not linear.
But it would fall short of the type of fiscal reforms that would satisfy Moody’s.
The recent killings repeat a pattern of political violence that has recurred all too often at crucial moments in Cambodia’s history – even after the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements, which were intended to bring not only peace, but also democracy and human-rights protection to the country’s long-suffering people.
Cambodia-fatigue among policymakers also played a role.
Internationally, too, some pressure has been building, but not enough.
But their behavior has now moved beyond the civilized pale.
Opposition to any perceived revival of Japanese militarism is hard-wired in Northeast Asia.
These mechanisms have so far promised more than they have delivered, though not for want of continuing efforts to give them more clout.
Countries like ours should take a clear stand when China overreaches externally (as it has in the South China Sea with its indefensible “nine-dashed line” asserting historical rights with no known justification in international law).
The Australian defense authorities now coordinating the search still say that to discover wreckage probably lying 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) deep, on so remote a seabed, will be like “finding a needle in a haystack.”
Australia’s close cooperation throughout the search with China – whose citizens comprised nearly two-thirds of those aboard the ill-fated flight, and whose naval and air resources have been unceasingly devoted to the common effort – has borne immediate fruit: a highly successful visit earlier this month by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
Mandela for the Ages
We knew that the risks we ran of being roughed up or arrested while demonstrating against visiting Springbok rugby teams were entirely trivial compared to the risks that he and his colleagues had been prepared to face.
Of all the meetings with all the leaders and other international figures around the world that I have had during all my years in public life, there is no question about which one gave me the most joy.
South Africa was lucky – almost miraculously so – to have had Nelson Mandela.
Obama’s rhetoric, and that of his most enthusiastic partner so far, Australia’s Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has wobbled between the first two objectives and hinted at the third, creating hopes and expectations that all three will be effectively pursued.
And the open sore of the Israel-Palestine conflict plays into every other rivalry.
The slow buy-in so far of Arab states to Obama’s campaign attests to the nervousness that many of them feel on all of these grounds.
But you would be wrong.
True, some Chinese scholars remain inclined to argue that the entire R2P enterprise – particularly its sanction of military action in exceptional cases– is just “old neo-interventionist wine in a new bottle.”
The core elements of Responsible Protection, as articulated by Chinese participants in the Beijing debate, won strong support around the table.
In terms of getting serious about saying “never again” to mass-atrocity crimes, that is about as positive a development as anyone could hope for.
The obvious solution, which economists have long advocated, is an increase in America’s gasoline taxes.
If gas taxes are high and consumption is low, as in Europe, fluctuations in the world price of oil have a smaller effect domestically.
Oil companies can immediately deduct a high percentage of their drilling costs from their tax liability, which other industries cannot do with their investments.
If other countries have found that what was politically impossible has suddenly turned out to be possible, why not the US?


Unlike Cook, in addition to being closeted, I was a woman and an introvert, and my politics tended to differ from those of my peers in my heavily male, extrovert-dominated profession. Since coming out in 2011, I have been publicly truer to myself and more authentic with others.
Research conducted by the Center for Talent Innovation shows that allies – people who support LGBT colleagues or work as advocates – play a decisive role in creating an inclusive community. In fact, 24% of the LGBT workers surveyed attribute their decision to come out professionally to their network of allies.
Finally, companies should continue to facilitate an inclusive workplace for everyone, not just LGBT employees. That means shifting from a culture of diversity, with its implicit focus on “them,” to an inclusiveness-centered culture of “us.”
Israel, which withdrew unilaterally to the periphery of Gaza in September 2005, has been seeking to prevent Palestinian resistance fighters from lobbing rockets into its territory.
The result has been a clear case of collective punishment in one of the most densely populated places on earth, with 3,823 persons per square kilometer.
Indeed, opinion polls conducted in Gaza show a spike in support for Hamas after every Israeli escalation.
Ayman works very hard in school and dreams of a future career. But, with 47 students in his cramped classroom and double shifts the norm, his learning environment is very stressful. Home is no refuge: the recent incursion into Jabalia was 200 meters from where Ayman lives. The shooting and shelling so terrorized his five-year-old sister that she still wakes up screaming at night.


Palestinian and Israeli children deserve to grow up in peace. And leaders on both sides, supported by the international community, must join in the kind of honest dialogue that is the only viable path toward achieving it.
Israel is more isolated regionally and internationally than ever, owing to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu diplomatic failures.
Hamas believes that if Israel were to come under pressure and, for example, freeze settlement construction, Abbas’s position would be strengthened.
If Palestine does achieve full UN membership, Palestinians recognize that it will be little more than symbolic.
Gaza is usually viewed in terms of Hamas’s overwhelming support there, but the reality is much different.
The 1967 war placed all of mandatory Palestine (as well as Sinai and the Golan) under Israeli military occupation.
Non-PA groups like Hamas acquired their own weapons mostly by buying them from Israeli soldiers or on the Israeli black market.
What they did not get was real sovereignty, without which it is difficult to imagine any improvement.
Greek interest rate premiums relative to Germany on ten-year government bonds stood at 8.6% on August 20th, which is even higher than at the end of April when Greece became practically insolvent and European Union-wide rescue measures were prepared.
The Case-Shiller index for single-family homes seemed to have recovered in spring 2009, after a 34% decline relative to the last boom.
The former boom countries – Greece, Ireland, and Spain – remain in recession, and their GDPs will continue to shrink.
On the other hand, France, Europe’s second biggest economy, is struggling.
If we have poor measures, what we strive to do (say, increase GDP) may actually contribute to a worsening of living standards.
If government spends more – even if inefficiently – output goes up.
This means that there is increasing disparity between average (mean) income and the median income (that of the “typical” person, whose income lies in the middle of the distribution of all incomes).
These studies, for instance, verify and quantify what should be obvious: the loss of a job has a greater impact than can be accounted for just by the loss of income.
"LOS ANGELES – In a recent interview, United States Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner laid out his view of the nature of world economic growth and the role of the US financial sector.
We want US firms to benefit from that…Now, financial firms are different because of the risk, but you can contain that through regulation.”
Even the strongest supporters of the Dodd-Frank reform legislation emphasize that it only went part way towards reducing the incentives for major financial institutions to take big risks.
He should spend more time with the authorities in Iceland or Ireland or Switzerland, countries where “financial globalization” allowed banks to become big relative to the economy.
Geithner is a very smart and experienced public servant.
Electing and appointing more women to powerful roles remains essential.
A woman at the bottom faces an even harsher reality.
Valuing care means valuing it enough to expect men to take on caregiving responsibilities to the same extent that we now expect women to take on breadwinning.
It is one thing to let women into the workforce; it is quite another to embrace full equality and create a cultural, economic, and social climate that encourages both men and women to support one another and their families equally with cash and care.
Most people around the world agree that men and women should be treated equally, and we also know that empowering women is a highly effective way to help families and societies lift themselves out of poverty.
In particular, allowing women to decide if, when, and how often they become pregnant leads to fewer deaths in childbirth and fewer infant deaths.
More broadly, the evidence from different approaches and countries is that spending one dollar on improving women's access to economic opportunities yields about $7 in health, education, and poverty-alleviation benefits.
And we now have stronger information for other gender targets when they compete with targets related to nutrition, health, poverty, and the environment.
लड़कियों को आवाज़ उठाने, चुनने, और अवसरों की समानता न देने से न केवल उनके जीवनों पर असर पड़ेगा, बल्कि इससे इस धरती का भविष्य भी प्रभावित होगा। समावेशी सतत विकास को प्रोत्साहित करने और जलवायु परिवर्तन का मुकाबला करने के प्रयास परस्पर अभिन्न रूप से जुड़े हुए हैं। यदि हमें विकास की चिंता है, तो हमें दुनिया भर में हो रहे ग्रीनहाउस गैस  उत्सर्जनों के परिणामों की चिंता करनी चाहिए। और यदि हम तुरंत कार्रवाई नहीं करते हैं, तो हम उन प्राकृतिक प्रणालियों को अपूरणीय क्षति पहुँचाएँगे जिन पर जीवन निर्भर करता है।

Over the last 12 years, her Worker’s Party (PT) has delivered the country’s strongest per capita GDP growth in more than three decades; reduced income inequality with an extensive system of social transfers that reaches one-third of Brazilian households; and reduced formal unemployment to a record-low 4.5%.
Even the economy’s apparent strengths – a thriving service sector and low unemployment – rest on unsustainable credit policies.
As the government attempted to direct these gains toward wealth redistribution, public expenditure rose and the social-benefits system – underpinned by so-called “acquired rights” – became increasingly rigid.
LONDON – Since his first address as China’s president last year, Xi Jinping has been espousing the so-called “Chinese Dream” of national rejuvenation and individual self-improvement.
And Japan’s external position was strong, just as China’s is now.
That is all the more reason to believe that Japan’s experience can provide important insight into the risks that China faces.
Indeed, almost half of the formal increase is not an increase at all, but merely recognition of rural workers who have been living and working in cities for some time.
General Marshall on the Aegean
Foreign aid and expertise could be used to modernize the property-registration and tax-collection systems.
And, finally, history suggests that a Marshall Plan for Greece might actually work.
Importantly, these projects were neither dictated by the donor nor chosen by the recipient, but decided in collaboration.
Economists are trained to worry about this problem, known as moral hazard.
So it is inevitable that we will use it to shape our own evolution.
In the worst case, the human genetic lineage itself could be wiped out by inter-species conflict.
Determining when it is permissible to interfere with parental choices is challenging, given the deference that parents typically receive.
Genetic Property Rights on Trial
One human gene out of approximately every five is now the subject of a patent, the majority of which are held by private firms.
That is a clever argument, but is it really the source of people’s profound disquiet about genetic patenting? In talking about similar issues raised in my recent book Body Shopping , I have heard many shocked reactions to the growing commodification of human tissue, but none more generally shared than this one: how can you take out a patent on life?
Proprietary rights for commercial firms over the most basic element of an individual’s genetic identity should not be enforceable.
In 1962, Gurdon’s finding that almost any cell in the body contains the complete DNA code enabled him to create a tadpole by cloning an adult frog.
These “blameless” patients seem to develop a different kind of lung cancer from those who report a history of smoking – one that is more responsive to new medications and has better, albeit still poor, outcomes.
For example, smoking could have caused epigenetic changes in a grandparent’s DNA, effectively switching off certain anti-cancer genes. The genes would then be passed down to descendants in this switched-off state.
The age of the gene is far from over; it has simply progressed into the age of epigenetics.
How should Europe deal with a Russia that is again pursuing great-power politics and making almost the same mistakes as the Soviet Union, which similarly relied on authoritarianism to try to reconcile the ambitions of a military superpower with the reality of a moderately developed and scarcely modernized economy?
In reality, however, the project is of paramount importance mostly in geopolitical terms: China, a land power, wants to challenge the potential economic and political influence of the US, a naval power, in Eurasia.
European leaders gravely miscalculated at the start of Turkey’s EU accession talks, believing that close ties would make the Middle East’s conflicts Europe’s problem.
The choice is between a mare nostrum or a region of instability and insecurity.
दुर्भाग्यवश यूरो संकट से यूरोपीय संघ बिलकुल ही अलग निकाय में बदल गया. आपसी सहयोग की भावना की जगह कर्जदाता और कर्जदार का संबंध पनपने लगा जिसमें कर्जदाता देश अपनी शर्तें थोपने लगे और अपना दबदबा कायम करने लगे. यूरोपीय संसद के चुनाव में कम मतदान के मद्देनजर अगर इटली के प्रधानमंत्री मैट्टियो रेन्जी को मिले समर्थन के साथ यूरोपीय संघ के विरोधी दक्षिण व वामपंथी मतों को भी मिला दिया जाए तो कहा जा सकता है कि अधिकांश नागरिक वर्तमान परिस्थितियों के विरोध में हैं.
यह सभी घटनाएं हाल ही में बड़ी तेजी से घटी हैं. यूरोपीय संघ और अमेरिका दोनों ही अपनी आंतरिक समस्याओं में उलझे हैं. इस तरह वे उस भू-राजनीतिक तथा विचारधारा से जुड़े खतरे से अनभिज्ञ हैं जो पुतिन के रूस से उत्पन्न हो रहा है. सवाल है कि उन्हें किस प्रकार इसका सामना करना चाहिए?
जिस तरह वे विश्व बैंक को गारंटी देती हैं उसी तरह नुकसान को पूरा करने की गारंटी दे सकती हैं. अर्थात् हरेक सरकार वास्तव में प्रयुक्त पूंजी को आंशिक तौर पर प्रदान कर बाकी रकम को कॉलेबल (जरूरत पड़ने पर मांगी गई) पूंजी के रूप में उपलब्ध करा सकती हैं जो नुकसान के एवज में भुगतान हो जाने के पश्चात् उपलब्ध होगी. यूरोपीय संघ को अपने वित्तीय कोष को भी परिवर्तित करना होगा ताकि जरूरत के वक्त मांगी गई पूंजी को छूट दे सकें और वास्तविक नुकसान को अनेक वर्षों में पूरा कर सकें. इस प्रकार की गारंटियों का एक विशेष गुण होता हैः जितनी ज्यादा भरोसेमंद वे होती हैं, उतनी ही कम उन्हें लागू करने की संभावना होती है. इस तरह पुनर्बीमा काफी हद तक लागतरहित साबित होता है. विश्व बैंक इसका जीवंत उदाहरण है.
Chancellor Angela Merkel did what was necessary to ensure the euro’s survival, and she did so at the least possible cost to Germany – a feat that earned her the support of pro-European Germans as well as those who trust her to protect German interests.
Neither the authorities nor the markets recognized this prior to the crisis, attesting to the fallibility of both.
Yet Eurobonds would substantially reduce the heavily indebted countries’ borrowing costs and go a long way to reestablishing a level playing field in the eurozone.
I can testify from personal experience that investors would flock to Greece once the debt overhang was removed.
Still, Germany cannot escape the responsibilities and liabilities that go with that role.
When the NATO Allies gather in Istanbul, much of the talk will concern the divisions between America and Europe over Iraq. But Europe is not alone in its estrangement from the United States under President George W. Bush's leadership.
After all, during his first nine months in office, Bush declared that he would devote tremendous attention to the hemisphere, and his actions seemed to back up his rhetoric.
They are finding themselves forced to shift their own rhetoric and attitude in order to dampen their defense of policies viewed as pro-American or US-inspired, and to stiffen their resistance to Washington's demands and desires.
With complex and heated wars threatening to bring about the collapse of states like Syria and Iraq, and the long-simmering conflict between Israel and Palestine seemingly as far from resolution as ever, it is almost easier to ask what Europe should avoid than what it should do.
Making matters worse, concessions on either side appear to leave no impression on the other.
During previous rounds of negotiations, the Palestinian Authority agreed, in principle, to exchange up to 1.9% of West Bank land for Israeli territory.
Georgia on Europe’s Mind
Political reforms, privatization, anti-corruption measures, a search for new leaders untainted by compromise with the former regime, and implementation of a pro-European foreign policy met no resistance.
The US has already done as much as it can to support political stability in Georgia since independence.
But this hesitant acceptance of a certain normality in its relations with its neighbors has always been vulnerable to a sudden eruption of Russia’s famously irrational “derzhava” – an aggressive ethos that glorifies the state and asserts its strength by pouncing on weakness.
The first days of the conflict in Georgia crushed this hypothesis.
I call these camps, respectively, Russia’s global and national kleptocrats.
I cannot predict who will win this growing confrontation.
BERLIN – The harsh reality of the past year has created unprecedented challenges for Germany and its foreign policy.
How far do our responsibilities extend? What, in short, is the “DNA" of German foreign policy?
This requires that we hone our tools and develop new ones, ranging from early-warning mechanisms to enhanced means of international cooperation.
As a result, we must strike the right balance between reinforcing indispensable structures and organizations like the UN and developing new norms and institutional means of minimizing long-term risks.
But, though we want to maintain and strengthen bilateral ties with important partner countries, when it comes to shaping global development, Germany is capable of acting effectively only within a solid European framework.
For Germany, all of these objectives must be pursued within the framework of a strong and integrated European Union in which we assume our leadership responsibilities for global peace and prosperity.
But the case for establishing full diplomatic relations was not so clear.
Post-war Germany could regain international legitimacy only through reconciliation with the Jewish people.
Walser’s stance amounted to a desperate call to allow his country to shape a new national identity – one that reflected its resolute repudiation of fascism and adoption of democracy, rather than its highly regrettable (and regretted) history.
German Reunification and the New Europe
The second key figure was West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who rushed into the opened breach, overriding his Allies’ caution, while the third actor was the East German people, who rushed into the streets, regardless of the risks, to demonstrate and push reunification forward.
Great Britain and Denmark, however, insisted that these new competences be exercised on intergovernmental grounds only, not by the European Commission, and thus only through consensus.
A dismal silence greeted its publication, which left Germany’s pro-European establishment isolated and dispirited.
Meanwhile, German diplomacy is actively reconstructing the country’s economic and cultural spheres of influence, and not only in Eastern Europe.
But frugal Germans typically do not see it that way.
Credit growth fueled asset-price increases and further credit growth, in a self-reinforcing cycle that persisted until the bubble burst and confidence collapsed.
But the inevitable consequence was that, while Japanese companies slowly deleveraged, public debt rose to 245% of GDP.
Today’s total debt level seems both unsustainable and impossible to reduce without depressing the economy.
First, how can we ensure that economies grow without rapid private credit growth, which leads to crisis and a debt overhang? Second – and the crucial issue today – how can we escape the debt trap in which past credit growth has left us?
The only way to do that is to run increased fiscal deficits, permanently financed by central-bank money.
Since the beginning of the century, the country has grown to become one of the world’s leading exporters, outstripping all other major European countries.
This gives them several advantages.
Quality makes exporters less vulnerable to changes in price – including those driven by rising wages.
The likely reason is that providing division managers with greater autonomy not only frees them up to respond to market demands; it also allows them to put their own career interests above the wellbeing of the firm.
With high prices for crude oil and natural gas bloating its coffers, Russia is once again aggressively confronting the small and still relatively weak states that fled the eroding Soviet empire 15 years ago.
But Europe’s stability and commitment to economic growth across the continent require that these interests be satisfied without economic pressure or unilateral intervention.
Instead of investing in discovering oil, Gazprom has become the biggest media group in Russia.
Russia should be welcome in institutions and agreements that foster cooperation, with reciprocal rights and responsibilities.
Its unemployment rate, at just below 5%, is half the European average.
The increasing mathematization of economics in recent decades has abetted this development.
Market-oriented policies today are seen as cold and anti-social, especially in Western industrialized countries.

Such cooperation could not come at a better time.
The IMF’s recent World Economic Outlook describes the success of this approach in recessionary environments.
The power of that relationship is what the Pisani-Ferry/Enderlein initiative represents – and what could, with sufficient political support, revitalize Europe.
But what they see confounds them, because Germany is openly refusing to lead.
Rather, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, the reunited Germany is beginning to realize that it can also act alone.
It is a strategic illusion of the large member states that they can defend their own status without this stolid entity called Europe. After all, can Germany really afford to let the EU’s enlargement into Eastern Europe fail?
Of course, everyone would prefer it if the line between monetary and fiscal policy had not become blurred as a result of the crisis.
With fiscal policy incapable of responding, the ECB was stuck with a second intermediation role: mitigating with its Target2 system the effects of European financial markets re-segmenting along national lines.
Legally constraining this capacity would be self-defeating.
Originally, Europe’s monetary union was supposed to provide a stable framework for its deeply integrated economies to enhance living standards sustainably.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has criticized the United States Federal Reserve and the Bank of England for “quantitative easing,” which has in practice allowed the central bank to monetize many types of government and non-government debt.
Hitler repeatedly promised that he would use any means to fight inflation, but his militarism also led to the expropriation of savings.
A cast-iron mechanism to ensure that the debt build-up does not continue forever is appealing as a way of withstanding increasingly fraught competition for funding.
Europe’s monetary unification of the 1990’s was supposed to be accompanied by fiscal convergence and harmonization.
Chancellor Gerhard Schröder had another fifteen months to go before the end of the electoral term, and it seemed that he had no difficulty mobilizing his admittedly slender majority in parliament.
Schröder’s SPD uses the word “social” a little more emphatically than it did in the last seven years.
It will clearly be a government without the new Left Party.
Perhaps what it requires most is a touch of Margaret Thatcher’s policies of the 1980’s, combined with Tony Blair’s rhetoric of today.
Another, more plausible theory is that over the past fifteen years there have been various external challenges or shocks that have hit the country simultaneously.
Think of Nokia, the mobile phone maker.
The slow growth of the eastern part of the country has pulled down the Germany-wide average, while the enormous demand for public funds in the east has increased public debt.
Ostensibly, this is just a matter of monetary housekeeping.
That is not going to change.
What would help is to turn the euro around – in the sense of convincing investors that the common currency has a bright future, because it is underpinned by a stronger monetary, fiscal, financial, and political union.
The link between currencies and gold was irrevocably broken in 1971, when US President Richard Nixon decided to suspend the convertibility of dollars into gold for central banks.
Whereas the average number of working days lost due to strikes from 2000 to 2004 amounted to 234 per 1,000 employees in Spain, 171 in Canada, and 101 in France, only 3.5 days were lost in Germany.
The status of permanent civil servant, marked by a special reciprocal obligation of loyalty, was created by the Prussian state in order to fill strategically important positions with people who could be fully trusted.
There is an economic explanation for why unions based on individual trades are detrimental.
But unions based on trades, which operate largely independently of one another, achieve even higher wages and create even more unemployment – so much so that employees as a whole are much worse off than they would be if an industry-wide union represented them.
And it matters a great deal which narrative prevails – for Germany, for Europe, and for the global economy.
And all of this distracts attention from the need to compete in a rapidly changing global economy.
But there is no workable alternative for Europe’s well-being – and, therefore, that of Germany.
Here, eurozone members would collectively opt for a smaller and less imperfect union that includes countries with more similar initial conditions – economically, financially, politically, and socially.
It is also the world’s top exporter of merchandise and the second-largest exporter of goods and services.
Unfortunately, there is no reason to be optimistic.
At bottom, the coincidence of unemployment and booming exports can be explained by the high and rigid wages from which Germany still suffers.
Germany’s Same Old Election
The worst has been mitigated and obscured in the wealthy countries by running up unprecedented levels of debt, but any moderately streetwise person knows that the next generation – and even the one after that – will be paying for the excesses of the investment bankers.
The greatest miracle in the 2009 election campaign is the resurgence of the Liberal Democrats (FDP).
Yet one historical law does seem to apply: in an immense economic crisis, the voters stick with the people whose economic competence they have traditionally trusted – that is, the very people who led them to ruin.
But Europe’s banking union also requires uniform rules for winding up insolvent financial institutions –&#160;and this has become a sticking point.
Some French banks’ traders openly boast of backing by the French government, which will never let its banks fail.
Such a mechanism would prevent the need for government intervention.
In 2008, when the Landesbanks were found to be full of American subprime mortgages, the German government bailed them out with a €500 billion ($650 billion) rescue package at its taxpayers’ expense.
When the economic crisis opened up the Pandora’s Box of the EU’s fiscal woes, Germany stepped up to the mark and helped to bail out Greece.
Germany is, of course, no advocate of an Anglo-Saxon growth model that requires monetary expansion and inflation.
Germany was not unaware that Greece and Portugal had serious fiscal difficulties before they entered the eurozone, but, through a process of negotiation, their entry was made possible.
First, however, was the chaos.
So I offered my services to the local Soviet authority and helped distribute basic foodstuffs to a small number of outlets in our district of Zehlendorf.
The Western powers in Germany, on the other hand, pursued, after a short period of non-fraternisation, a policy of controlled empowerment.
This is where the Marshall Plan of American support became crucial.
On balance this is a better method of dealing with a nation’s zero hour than doing things the other way round.
In order to achieve this, the treaty created posts, such as the President of the European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, whose incumbents could speak and act on behalf of the entire EU.
In the vast majority of cases in which common action would be preferable, member states would provide full support to the EU.
“Poor old Germany,” Henry Kissinger once quipped.
Renzi sudah hampir menghapuskan, setidaknya secara retoris, aturan-aturan fiskal yang selama ini dipegang teguh oleh Jerman.
Selama bertahun-tahun, Schäuble telah memainkan permainan untuk mewujudkan visinya akan arsitektur optimal di Eropa yang dapat dicapai dalam keterbatasan politik dan budaya yang selama ini diterima begitu saja.
Pada bulan September, Schäuble membagikan ikhtisar tiga proposal kepada rekan-rekannya di Eurogroup guna mencegah krisis euro yang baru.
Sementara itu, komitmen Jerman terhadap “aturan-aturan” yang tidak sepadan dengan ketahanan Eurozone akan melemahkan politisi-politis Perancis dan Jerman yang sejak dulu hingga sekarang mengharapkan aliansi dengan negara-negara ekonomi terbesar di Eropa.
And the government is recording a sizeable budget surplus.
Last August, the German government appointed a 21-member committee of experts (including the three authors) from business, labor unions, finance, and academia to determine how to achieve the target.
As for purely private-sector investment, the committee recommends a focus on developing the sectors that will dominate tomorrow’s economy.
The expert committee supports EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s plan to channel some €300 billion of private-sector money toward infrastructure, and proposes that if the scheme is successful, it should be transformed into a permanent European investment mechanism. This would require more funding in the long run for the European Fund for Strategic Investments, to which the German government should contribute directly.
Time is a luxury that Europe does not have. With every month that the economy loses productive capacity, the likelihood of stagnation and deflation rises.
The German government can use its considerable leverage to compel France and Italy to pursue the structural reforms that both countries need, while allowing a growth-friendly demand stimulus to lift the threat of deflation hanging over the eurozone. And it has the authority to bolster the ECB’s credibility and thus its efforts to ensure future price stability and prevent financial contagion.
What a contrast between the photo, taken less than 80 years ago in the Warsaw Ghetto, of a small Jewish child with raised arms and fearful eyes, and one taken a few days ago in Munich of a smiling refugee boy, his head protected by a policeman’s hat.
With firmness and clarity, Merkel has condemned all forms of xenophobia and criticized her European counterparts for refusing to accept refugees.
By contrast, France and many other European countries face more favorable demographic conditions and worse economic conditions, including high unemployment.
To reverse the formula of former Czech President Václav Klaus, the suicide of Europe will come not from accepting the flow of refugees, but from closing our doors to them and washing our hands of their fate.
But a profound weakness remains: To be blunt, it concerns the risk-taking culture that still prevails within some departments of global banks and in the financial system itself.
Sadly, until now, many banks have adopted an unconvincing piecemeal approach.
Employees must understand instinctively what may be done and what should never be done.
Either the banks reform themselves, or public authorities will intervene still further.
Transparency International and occasionally the World Bank like to rank countries by their degree of corruption, with the media then ceaselessly citing where each country stands.
For example, when the East Asian financial crisis broke out, there followed a systematic attempt to pin the blame on the affected countries: “crony capitalism” allegedly had somehow crippled their economies!
But if policies can create corruption, it is equally true that the cost of corruption will vary with the specific policies.
Real and sustainable change is supposedly possible only by transforming the “rules of the game” – the manner in which governments operate and relate to the private sector.
Poor governance may, in general, be the binding constraint in Zimbabwe and a few other countries, but it was not in China, Vietnam, or Cambodia – countries that are growing rapidly despite poor governance – and it most surely is not in Ethiopia, South Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, or Brazil.
Macroeconomic policy is an area in which economists have done a lot of thinking about institutional prerequisites.
Insofar as they narrow rather than expand the menu of available institutional choices, they serve the cause of good governance badly.
In 1993, the Commission, under Jacques Delors, proposed a capital spending plan in its White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment.
A bridge financed by the EIB may be more affordable than one financed by capital markets, but it remains the same bridge and has the same economic impact.
Many large-scale investments that only pay off over the long term – for example, in energy, digital infrastructure, and transport – are concentrated in state-regulated sectors, giving governments the power to influence business decisions.
This is intentional.
Getting it Right in North Africa
There is a lot of goodwill to ensure a democratic dividend for these countries, while of course managing expectations.
On the other hand, we can be confident that the longer-term gains of social and political change will be positive, as the drag of predatory corruption and limitations on individual and economic liberties are eliminated.
If the nations of North Africa are to succeed in meeting the needs and expectations of their peoples, policymakers must draw the appropriate lessons from the past – and aim to get it right this time around.
Women's status has improved, and girls enjoy equal access to education, with even higher enrollment rates than boys in many countries.
Societies became racially and ethnically complex, as the European, Amerindian, and African populations intermarried, but the long-term trend of European dominance, indigenous and Afro-American subservience, and entrenched poverty became a scar on Latin American societies.
Asian developing countries are now producers of computers, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and software.
Such a policy would entail committing to a major increase in spending on research and development, as Asian developing countries have done.
Has the American electorate swung to the right? Are Americans now more concerned about "values?"
Real interest rates may rise, as America borrows more and more.
Those who voted for Bush may not be as outraged by American involvement in torture, or the misleading information about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and connections with Al Qaeda, as those abroad.
Instability in the Middle East will continue to limit oil supplies, discouraging the expansion of production.
Some worry that this will worsen relations with the US.
Malaria is a killer disease transmitted by a specific species of mosquitoes.
There are two major obstacles to solving the malaria problem.
Rather than giving away bed nets, rich-country organizations like the United States Agency for International Development try to sell them to the extreme poor, albeit at heavily discounted prices.
But there is also a growing realization that malaria is a disaster that must be addressed.
But, for the millions who face the crushing burden of poverty, mere proclamations that help is on the way are not enough to create jobs or foster development.
Now, debt in the 28 countries for which relief has been approved has declined by an average of two-thirds, while their expenditures on health, education, and other social services have risen to almost four times the amount of debt-service payments.
Some donors have now promised to do so, though only over time; others are not ready to go that far, but have promised more aid than they currently give.
Getting Serious in Russia\u0027s War on Terror
First, contacts between Maskhadov and a few Russian politicians haven't - at least as of yet - influenced the Kremlin's position.
In fact, the latter are a tiny minority. But they are energetic, mobilized, and experienced fighters.
Osama bin Laden doesn't work for money and wants to destroy the entire West, not weaken Russia in particular.
But he must act now, for public support can be no substitute for resolute and effective action.
They therefore presume that, despite American professions to the contrary, the US seeks BMD capabilities that can negate Russia’s strategic deterrent under the guise of protecting America and its allies from Iran.
Beyond these specific BMD discussions, US arms-control efforts with Russia currently focus on strategic stability talks and other dialogues designed to establish a favorable conceptual foundation for the next round of formal arms-control negotiations.
Support also exists for jointly manned centers, Russian expert visits to NATO BMD facilities, and exchange of early-warning information from Russian and NATO radars regarding potential missile launches.
There is a wise American saying: “If you are in a hole, stop digging.”
So what to do now? The Bush administration, predictably, is pushing for new and tougher sanctions, based on an implied warning in the earlier UN Resolution, and arguing, as it did in the run-up to the invasion in Iraq, that the UN’s credibility is at stake.
Today, Iran declares that it wants to observe the NPT, and that has no intention of building a nuclear bomb.
Instead of formulating new sanctions for the UN Security Council, they should use the next few months to explore confidentially what level of restrictions combined with verification Iran would consider in exchange for undisputed enrichment.
Muhammad Khatami (1997-2005) tried to implement dramatic political reform, while Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (1989-97) tried to open the Iranian economy to the West.
Ahmedinejad is no different.
There has been no answer yet, though there does seem to be some recent movement between Russia and Iran on the provision of nuclear fuel for Iran’s controversial reactors.
That person is Khamenei, not Ahmedinejad.
According to the conventional wisdom, Britain’s social model is based on coexistence between different communities, with each continuing to observe its conventions and customs while respecting the country’s laws – an informal federation of communities.
Republicanism grants each individual, regardless of his or her other identities equal rights in order to achieve universal equality.
This vision should make republican efforts proportional to the importance of people’s handicap in order to free them from the burden of their initial conditions.
Needless to say, it’s the big picture that really matters. The message of the European Parliament election was that the EU is losing public support at an alarming rate.
This uncomfortable truth makes the idea of the EU’s disintegration seem absurd, yet that outcome is a real threat, owing to the rising tide of euroskepticism fueled by EU institutions’ failure to connect with Europe’s voters.
Europe’s industries and national authorities need to get their act together and fully exploit the economies of scale that the EU offers, while the EU itself must embrace change and submit itself to severe streamlining: Reform or die.
भारत के लिए आर्थिक पथप्रदर्शक

Is the market no longer able to generate prosperity? Is China’s brand of state capitalism an alternative and potentially victorious paradigm?
Consider recent events in Argentina, which is facing certain economic losses as anxious investors have second thoughts about the country in the aftermath of the government’s nationalization of energy giant YPF.
Indeed, on Europe’s doorstep, the show trial and imprisonment of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko is jeopardizing her country’s international economic standing.
Giving Till it Heals
Now it is roughly 0.25% of GNP.
In fact, US official development assistance amounts to just 0.15% of America’s GNP, which is less than one-fourth the global target.
But there is a limit to greed.
One of the main problems today is too much debt in the global financial system – among sovereigns, banks, and households, and especially among the advanced economies.
There is a solution.
This is especially important for the young.
In these circumstances, the International Monetary Fund – with its 187 member countries – is uniquely positioned to foster collective action.
उस समय, विभिन्न रोगों के लिए सदाशयपूर्वक सरोकार रखनेवाले पैरोकारों ने मृत्यु के जो आँकड़े प्रकाशित किए उनसे उन्हें धन जुटाने और ध्यान आकर्षित करने के मुद्दे को उठाने में मदद मिली। लेकिन जब सभी दावों को जोड़ा गया, तो संबंधित वर्ष में मरनेवाले लोगों की संख्या वास्तव में मरनेवाले लोगों की कुल संख्या की तुलना में कई गुना अधिक थी। और जब नीति निर्माताओं के पास सही आंकड़े होते भी थे, तो उनमें आमतौर पर केवल लोगों की मौत का कारण शामिल होता था, उन बीमारियों का नहीं जिनसे उनका जीवन पीड़ा से भर जाता था।


Yet, in late October, EU member states agreed on a new policy framework for climate and energy for 2030 – one that, like the EU’s 2020 climate and energy package, lacks a solid foundation.
In fact, no outcome would be worse than a “feel-good” agreement composed of vague, unenforceable targets.
PRINCETON – At first glance, today’s major international crises seem to have little in common.
And the security situation in the eastern part of the country is deteriorating.
But, in today’s interconnected world, capital can move much more quickly and to many more destinations, crossing borders with the click of a mouse.
Today, some important integrative policies lie within reach.
NEW YORK – Today’s world is more economically and financially integrated than at any time since the latter half of the nineteenth century.
Pricing would be more transparent, and consumers could spot anomalies (from their phones) and shop for the best deals.
But the same political legitimacy cannot be imagined for any transatlantic or trans-Pacific monetary authority, much less a global one.
Purchase sovereign debt but not state or commonwealth (for example, Puerto Rican) debt? Though deciding such questions at a supranational level is not theoretically impossible, it is utterly impractical in the modern era.
As was amply demonstrated in the last seven decades, reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers would also help – above all in agriculture and services, as envisaged by the Doha Round.
Government debt has increased by $25 trillion, with the advanced economies accounting for $19 trillion – a direct result of severe recession, fiscal-stimulus programs, and bank bailouts.
Yet precisely the opposite approach is now being taken in the United States, where some first-time homebuyers have now been given access to 97% loan-to-value mortgages.
Similarly, it would be difficult – but not impossible – to reduce the incentives, created by almost all countries’ tax regimes, for corporate leverage.
Focusing on “net” government debt (which excludes intra-government debt holdings, such as the bonds owned by central banks) is a more effective approach to assessing and ensuring the sustainability of public debt.

So far, however, jawboning has had little effect.
Trade unions’ membership and influence declined sharply, owing to increased global competition and, in some countries, deliberate legal reforms.
The best way to achieve that is not through the current mix of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing.
And tax and social-welfare systems can be used to channel income toward those most likely to spend it.
Despite all this, massive excess bank reserves remain unlent.
Thus, temporary tax rebates are mostly saved, not spent.
Indeed, China frets over the safety of the US Treasury bonds that it holds.
This time, virtually every economy is suffering substantially and the banking crisis is global.
The cost of damage to commercial and residential buildings worldwide is averaging $314 billion each year, with the private sector bearing as much as 85% of that price tag.
This level of business engagement bodes well for pioneering a new planet-friendly and people-sensitive approach to global prosperity.
For example, experts estimate that 60% of the land that will be urbanized by 2030 has not yet been developed.
Starting our international calendar with the Sendai meeting on disaster-risk reduction sends a clear signal that the world is ready to integrate its strategies.
Average annual growth in the least developed countries, many in Africa, reached almost 7% last year.
The UN report observes that national economic policies and existing multilateral settings are not designed to mitigate effectively the risk of a global slowdown or to address global imbalances.
The multilateral surveillance mechanisms launched last year by the IMF are a step in the right direction, but only if they become part of an institutionalized multilateral mechanism of surveillance and policy coordination.
For three and a half years following the start of the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover’s top priority was to balance the budget, trying – but ultimately failing – to restore business confidence.
Instead, each proposal faced its own opposition.
Instead of simply promoting his policies, Feldstein presents them as a “safe and effective alternative” to other approaches.
But above all, try something.”
Already, 60,000 people die every year from causes related to antimicrobial resistance in the United States and Europe – some ten times the worldwide death toll from the ongoing Ebola crisis. By 2050, if the problem is allowed to continue to grow, antimicrobial resistance will kill more than ten million people per year.
Data provided by diagnostic devices could be a potent weapon in containing these outbreaks.
Moreover, the recovery from the last major slump, in the early 1980s, brought about a quarter-century of unprecedentedly strong and stable macroeconomic performance.
Six years after the crisis, some prominent economists are asking whether insufficient investment and/or waning gains from technological innovation have pushed the global economy into a “new normal” of lower growth and slow, if any, gains in living standards.
Optimists counter that smart phones, Big Data, and expected advances in nanotechnology, robotics, and biosciences are harbingers of a new era of technology-driven productivity improvements.
Better measures for these changes are essential for an accurate assessment of economic progress.
SINGAPORE – In recent weeks, there has been a chorus of opinion arguing for a sharp increase in global investment, particularly in infrastructure.
Moreover, China’s rapidly aging population and declining working-age population will reduce long-term investment demand.
So, although India might initially absorb some international capital, it might ultimately prefer to build foreign reserves by running small external deficits or even a surplus.
Indeed, almost every period of globalization and prosperity has been accompanied by symbiotic imbalances.
Emerging countries have fared better, but they, too, have started to flounder lately.
But it is only the eurozone that has badly disappointed in recent years.
The US was running a deficit of more than 6.5% of its GDP, and China had a surplus of close to 10% of its GDP.
The conventional wisdom on wealth and inequality is similarly mistaken.
Gaps in income and wealth may be shooting up within individual countries, but per capita income in developing countries is rising much faster than in the advanced economies.
And, critically, we must follow through on our commitments.
There have been some notable moves in this direction, though it remains to be seen whether they will translate into real action.
US government funding of research into hydraulic fracturing – the technology now driving the surge in America’s oil and gas production – dates back to the 1970s.
The maxims of today – the need for diverse suppliers, enhanced interconnection, greater efficiency, and a sensible energy mix – have been discussed for at least a decade.
Di negara-negara seperti Singapura dan Afrika Selatan, perusahaan yang terdaftar di bursa efek wajib mengungkapkan kinerja lingkungan hidup dan sosial, suatu persyaratan yang semakin dipandang perlu oleh investor dan regulator untuk menjalankan pasar keuangan yang efisien.
Namun upaya ini akan diterapkan secara lebih luas sebab pemberi modal dan regulator sudah mengakui dampak besar yang berasal dari gangguan lingkungan hidup.
Agar mampu menggerakkan modal yang diperlukan, pembuat kebijakan perlu mengendalikan kekuatan sistem keuangan.
But, as devastating as that outbreak has been, its death toll of less than 20,000 people is dwarfed by that of preventable diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, which together caused more than three million deaths in 2013, hitting the world’s poorest people the hardest.
Antibiotics have practically wiped out the disease in rich countries, and have helped to reduce TB’s mortality rate by more than one-third over the last two decades, saving an estimated 37 million lives since 1995.
Here, too, there is a cost-effective solution.
That is a $28 return for each dollar spent.
KIGALI – A decade ago, the global community stood together to declare that where people live should not determine whether they live or die when confronted by the scourge of AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria.
Today, Rwanda is a peaceful country full of promise and hope, with one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.
And, alarmingly, only one in six patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis currently receives proper treatment.
The costs of inaction are morally – and economically – untenable.
Imperfect information and difficulties in monitoring firms pose significant obstacles to idealized risk-sharing instruments.
I am not advocating a return to the early Middle Ages, when Church usury laws forbade interest on loans.
These funds may prove to be an effective short-term salve, but, over the long run, they will likely fuel moral-hazard problems, and potentially plant the seeds of deeper crises in the future.
WASHINGTON, DC – The economic geography of the world is changing.
The fact that most participants in discussions about global poverty – the readers of this commentary included – know few, if any, people who live below the poverty line is an indication of the extent of the world’s economic segregation.
In fact, a limited amount of unemployment can help to promote development.
But the deep and pervasive inequality that exists today can only be condemned.
But this is just the beginning of a fundamental transformation.
In a medium that does not map onto political borders, it is impossible to manage risks successfully from just one jurisdiction.
Nor do they cooperate on the issue through other institutions, with the exception of the G-20 and the United Nations.
By 2020, two-thirds of the global population will be online.
The worldwide financial bubble cannot and should not be recreated.
Yet this will occur too slowly to prevent a rapid rise in unemployment and a massive shortfall of production relative to potential output.
The new financing would include direct loans from rich countries’ export-credit agencies to enable poor countries to borrow long term (for example, 40 years) to build roads, power grids, renewable energy generation, ports, fiber optic networks, and water and sanitation systems.
A year ago, most pundits argued that this was unsustainable.
On both accounts, aggregate demand will decline.
This is less startling than it may appear: econometric studies suggest that it takes a year to two before the full effects of oil-price increases are felt.
In either case, the US government, hamstrung by already-wide deficits, may feel powerless to respond with countercyclical fiscal policy.

बेशक, मार्शल योजना के विस्तार के पीछे एक राजनीतिक प्रेरणा थी। पश्चिमी यूरोप से लेकर पूर्वोत्तर एशिया तक के अमीर देशों का एक स्वच्छता घेरा बनाकर, अमेरिका को यह उम्मीद थी कि वह शीत युद्ध के शुरू होने पर साम्यवाद के प्रसार को रोक पाएगा। इसमें उन विकासशील देशों को छोड़ दिया गया जो इस तरह के राजनीतिक उद्देश्यों की पूर्ति नहीं करते थे।

Obesity is responsible for about 5% of deaths worldwide.
In India and China, the prevalence of obesity in cities is 3-4 times the rate in rural areas.
But all the evidence shows that relying on knowledge about obesity and willpower is not enough to offset the evolutionary instinct to overeat.
We do not yet have all the answers when it comes to the best way to tackle obesity.
Given the current level of official resources at the disposal of the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, Spain now seems too big to fail yet too big to be bailed out.
There are also the political and economic turmoil in Pakistan and the risk of a rise in cyber-attacks – for example, in retaliation for criminal proceedings against WikiLeaks.
Indeed, after four years (2007-2010) of either recession or sub-par recovery, the process of balance-sheet repair – while not completed yet – is underway, and may result in less saving and more spending to boost growth in advanced economies.
Until the crisis of 2008, middle- and lower-income job growth occurred entirely in the non-tradable sector of the economy, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of advanced countries’ output and employment.
But technology’s impact does not stop there.
Adjacency is no longer a requirement.
There is no guarantee that taking the right steps in these areas would entirely overcome the employment challenges that individuals and countries face, though doing so would help.
At the same time, the pace of technological progress and globalization necessitates rapid structural changes in both developed and developing countries alike.
The former would exacerbate the country’s slowdown, and neither change is in the cards.
The good news is that the gap between the emerging and advanced countries has narrowed greatly in the last three decades.
The End of Pasta?
But here, too, the evidence contradicts such fears; in fact, malaria deaths have dropped more than 25% over the last ten years.
Yields of all major crops have been rising dramatically in recent decades, owing to higher-yielding crop varieties and farmers’ greater use of fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation.
Our linguine supplies are safe.
As in today’s developed countries, their consumption of wheat will not depend on whether it is produced in their own country, but on global food prices and local income.
It can be observed in surveys of the surface of the sea and in satellite measurements of the troposphere.
To be sure, surface temperatures remain important.
It confirms the long-held theory that the earth has an energy budget that is affected by radiative perturbations at the top of the atmosphere, though partitioning that energy between the surface and the deeper oceans has been difficult.
As long as we lack a clear understanding of the relationship between our cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions and the temperature of the earth, it will remain difficult to assess the potential for damage related to climate change caused by humans – or develop the right strategies to minimize it.
Should they instead delay reductions for 20 years?
Climate engineering has the advantage of speed.
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, about a million tons of sulfur dioxide was pumped into the stratosphere, reacting with water to form a hazy layer that spread around the globe, and – by scattering and absorbing incoming sunlight – cooled the earth’s surface for almost two years.
Many environmental lobbyists oppose even researching climate engineering.
Of course, with the EU already having promised an 8% cut by next year in the Kyoto Protocol, this new target seems slightly less ambitious. Moreover, in continuing the fundamental problems besetting the crippled Kyoto Protocol, the EU has essentially gone and made a worse deal.
But nobody sees fit to reveal the agreement’s dirty little secret: it will do next to no good, and again at very high cost. According to one well-established and peer-reviewed model, the effect of the EU cutting emissions by 20% will postpone warming in 2100 by just two years, yet the cost will be about $90 billion annually.
Fortunately, there is such a strategy: research and development.
Global warming is the most horrific challenge facing these regions, we are told. Its resolution is vital.
Our researcher accompanies him to a free clinic.
Twenty kilometers from Mojo, our researcher met Desi Koricho and her eight-month-old son, Michel.
For most regions, weather changes will increase agricultural productivity.
Rich countries and donors have limited budgets and attention spans.
But, she says: “The issues I am experiencing have greater priority.
Say we decide to reduce CO2 emissions by three-quarters by 2100 while maintaining reasonable growth.
Green and Galiana examine the state of non-carbon-based energy today – nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal, etc. – and find that, taken together, alternative energy sources would get us less than halfway toward a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050, and only a tiny fraction of the way toward stabilization by 2100.
That is the wrong question.
You know how you are told to give your kids organic food because pesticides will give them cancer? Well, it’s technically true that there is a link between the chemicals and illness, but the risk is miniscule in any well-regulated country.
Campaigners and the media claim that we should cut our CO2 emissions to save the polar bear.
The list of urgent concerns is topped by global warming, but also includes terrorism, pesticides, and the loss of biodiversity – and seems to have virtually no end.
Food has become more plentiful and affordable, especially in the developing world, where calorie availability has increased by 40% per person over the past 40 years, while food prices have more than halved.
Globalization After the Crisis
Indeed, while closing an economy may insulate it from shocks, it can also result in stagnation and even severe homegrown crises.
To pursue its comparative advantage and prosper in a globalized world, a country needs a price system that reflects the relative abundance of its factor endowments.
Government compensation for such pioneering firms can speed the process.
Anti-American sentiments are rising around the world.
Historical proof that globalization does not necessarily mean homogenization can be seen in Japan, a country that deliberately isolated itself from earlier waves of globalization.
Vibrant cultures are constantly changing and borrowing from other cultures - and that borrowing is not always from the US.
The Internet also allows people to establish a more diverse set of political communities.
The Cacophony of the World
And the United Nations, which best embodies the principles of international order, is as divided and impotent as ever.
The US may be intent on creating a transatlantic trade-and-investment pact with Europe, which would make a political statement to the world that the West writ large constitutes the universal normative reference point.
Even power itself is more fragmented than ever.
Poverty has been reduced. Life expectancy has increased.
Middle Eastern jihadis use the Internet to recruit young Europeans.
Widespread dangers, such as climate change or a new financial crisis, can require the cooperation of dozens of countries and a broad range of institutions.
As a result, governments across Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania are becoming more parochial in their concerns, starving international agencies and regional organizations of the funding, credibility, and leadership capabilities needed to mount a proper response to the challenges of globalization.
Indeed, the foreign presence in soccer surpasses anything that we see in other areas of international commerce.
But soccer enthusiasts care about country as well as club, and here the consequences of the global mobility of talent are not as straightforward.
If you are a resident of Yaoundé, the decline in the quality of domestic play may not be a big deal if you can afford a cable connection that allows you to tune in to the English Premier League.
The lesson is not that embracing globalized soccer is a bad thing.
The fear of globalization in the West is nothing new.
Thus, foreign aid was regarded as a plot to trap poor nations in a neo-colonial embrace.
The current crisis did not create the debate about globalization now heard in the West; it only made it slightly more salient.
The world’s first wave of economic globalization, led by the British Empire in the nineteenth century, came to an end literally with a bang on a Sunday afternoon in 1914, when Gavrilo Princip killed (with two uncannily well-aimed bullets) Austria’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife.
But what of the unemployed who become locked into their societies? The war on terror has shown us the dangers that can arise from the social frustrations that often result.
This is why today’s most contentious borders separate economies where the income gaps between people on the two sides are the greatest.
If globalization, which has so enriched the world’s wealthiest countries, is to continue, governments must find ways to increase incomes more evenly.
As globalization connects far-flung people and economies, the consequences are not always what was expected – or welcome.
The roots of China’s problems lie in its attempt to shift from exports and investment in infrastructure to a growth model based on higher domestic consumption.
The protectionist impulse has been absent from the response to the current crisis so far, but that could change.
Europe and the US now face a new challenge: They must respond not only to their own economic difficulties, but also to the deep human suffering produced by economic and political failure elsewhere.
It is a “globally connected institution,” with more than 40 individual country partners and growing ties to other international organizations.
For starters, it means that not only NATO’s military resources, but also its human capital and practical knowledge in combating many different kinds of threats are available globally.
The most powerful member of a network is the node that has the most connections to others, which means that a node can increase its power not only by adding connections directly, but also by increasing the connectedness of nearby nodes.
On the contrary, not only are many of the scary-sounding ingredients perfectly safe, but manufacturers, in their haste to meet consumer demand, sometimes substitute inferior – or even harmful – ingredients or processes.
But that label has a profound impact: it sends the unmistakable message that BPA is a health hazard.
Forced to resort to older, more toxic, and less effective pesticides (primarily pyrethroids, which had been largely phased out), Europe’s farmers are seeing a resurgence of insect predation.
लेकिन वैज्ञानिक कभी-कभी वैज्ञानिक पद्धति को छोड़कर - प्रायः कुख्याति या आर्थिक लाभ के लिए - मिथ्या प्रचार करने और विशेषज्ञता रहित परंतु जानकारी की भूखी जनता में भय पैदा करने के लिए “धूर्तता” पर उतर आते हैं।  वैज्ञानिक अधिकार का ऐसा दुरुपयोग विशेष रूप से “जैविक” और “प्राकृतिक” खाद्य उद्योगों में व्यापक रूप से हो रहा है जो लोगों के कृत्रिम या “अप्राकृतिक” उत्पादों के भय का लाभ उठाते हैं।
यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कि, जैसा कि फ़्लोरिडा विश्वविद्यालय में बागवानी विज्ञान विभाग के अध्यक्ष, केविन फ़ोल्टा ने स्पष्ट किया है, सिस्टम्स बायोलॉजी तभी एक उपयोगी दृष्टिकोण हो सकता है जब इसका उपयोग सही तरीके से किया जाए।  जैसा कि उन्होंने बताया है, सिस्टम्स बायोलॉजी “एक ऐसा तरीका है जिसमें विद्यमान डेटा को समेकित करने पर आधारित पूर्वानुमान लगाए जाते हैं, और फिर उससे सांख्यिकीय रूप से इस संभावना का पता लगाया जाता है कि क्या पूर्वानुमान सही हो सकते हैं।"  लेकिन, वे इस बात पर जोर देते हैं कि उसके बाद पूर्वानुमानों का परीक्षण किया जाना चाहिए, “और सिस्टम्स के दृष्टिकोण की पुष्टि की जानी चाहिए।"
God Crashes the Tea Party
Bush’s early avowal of his conversion experience was given in language poll-tested for acceptance by fundamentalist Christians.
Likewise, the Tea Party, which showed no interest in racist language or iconography at its outset, increasingly injects such demagoguery into its messages.
It was not the US that was gripped by this wave of racist paranoia, but France, the cradle of “liberté, egalité et fraternité.”
Either way, we need religion to curb nature’s vices.
The third difficulty for the view that morality is rooted in religion is that some elements of morality seem to be universal, despite sharp doctrinal differences among the world’s major religions.
2. You pass by a small child drowning in a shallow pond, and you are the only one around.
For example, because atheists supposedly lack a moral compass, they should be guided by pure self-interest and walk by the drowning child.
We can do this without blasphemy, because it is our own nature, not God, that is the source of our morality.
Moreover, an Iranian diplomat in Oslo, Mohammed Reza Heydari, resigned in protest against the regime’s behavior after the December riots.
A concrete demonstration of its commitment is the request to make better use of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
The appeal of the historic gold standard lay in an institutional capacity to build confidence.
Thus, in periods after large new gold discoveries – for example, following the California Gold Rush of 1849, and again in the 1890’s, when new mining techniques opened up South African, Alaskan, and Australian reserves – the classical gold standard had a mild inflationary bias.
This became the central feature of the gold-standard world: a country that was losing gold reserves would tighten interest rates in order to attract money.
Autonomous interest-rate determination would penalize banks that have borrowed in southern Europe from their national central banks.
But, while “capitalism” – defined as an economic system built on private ownership of property – clearly has prevailed, there are many differences among the nearly 200 countries that now practice it in some form.
Southeast Asian economies have demonstrated great success with state guidance, and, until the late 1990’s, there were calls in the United States to emulate their practices.
In our view, the limits of managerial capitalism explain why, after approaching US levels of per capita income in the late 1980’s, both Western Europe and Japan failed to match America’s information-technology-driven productivity resurgence that began in the 1990s.
State-guided economies can continue their rapid growth path, but ultimately they will need to make a transition to a suitable blend of the other two forms of “good capitalism” if they want to continue rapid growth.
I can think of no better way to restore confidence in these two venerable institutions than to finally open up the way their presidents are selected.
Instead of a development strategy, there was simply an expansion of the anti-corruption agenda initiated by his predecessor, James Wolfensohn.
This is something for Wolfowitz’s successor to bear in mind.
Hats off, first, to Mexico for pioneering the idea of “conditional cash transfers” to poor households.
The Spanish Government rightly proposed that true solutions to poverty require simultaneous investments in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure, and then the Spanish put up the funds to help make that integrated vision a practical reality.
Mali is eager to scale up investments in agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure in its 166 poorest communities.
Leadership is needed, within the countries in need as well as among the rich nations that can help to launch and finance the solutions.
Order never just emerges; it is the result of conscious efforts by the most powerful entities in the world.
So the old partners need new ones.
The prospect of a threat to the stability of the greater Middle East and to the flow of oil should give China an incentive to support robust sanctions against Iran.
This era’s major states, developed and emerging alike, have the ability to reach accord on today’s defining issues.
The first term defined the tumultuous middle of the twentieth century, the latter its benign ending.
The word had been used earlier, but in a rather different sense.
But in the 2000’s, the meaning of globalization shifted and began to take on a semi-positive note, in large part because it increasingly looked as if the major winners of globalization included many rapidly growing emerging markets.
Goodbye to Going It Alone
It was soon grew to a “G-7” of advanced industrial economies.
Leaders’ time is a scarce resource. They cannot afford to attend multiple summits for each transnational issue.
The G-8, for example, is often credited with helping to advance international trade rounds, addressing public health issues, and increasing aid to Africa.
Over the past six years, the value of the trade-weighted dollar has fallen by more than a quarter, as the US has continued to rack up historically unprecedented trade deficits.
State and municipal finances are in even worse shape.
And the absence of a Europe-wide fiscal policy creates significant uncertainty about how the European Central Bank would finance itself if it suddenly faced large losses on junk bank debt after a big bailout.
But it could happen a lot faster this time.
The ethnic minority groups that inhabit the area complain that the current revenue-allocation formula, which leaves Nigeria’s oil-producing states with only 13% of oil revenue, is grossly unfair and insufficient compensation for the damaged ecology they endure.
The powers of the Nigerian presidency are extensive, and Jonathan’s handlers have been dropping loud hints that they will deploy them to whip the governors – including the northerners – into line.
Muhammadu Buhari, whom Babangida replaced as military head of state in 1985, is also expected to run, as the nominee of the Congress of Progressive Change.

Likewise, we have also seen in recent months the creation by schoolgirls in Bangladesh of child-marriage-free zones, aimed at defending the right of girls to stay in school instead of being married off as teenage brides against their will.
Some 57 million children still do not go to school, 500 million girls will never finish the secondary education to which they are entitled, and 750 million adults remain illiterate.
The late US Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren’s words in Brown v. Board of Education,which struck down the legal basis for racial segregation in America’s public schools, remain no less relevant today: “It is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education.”
The “Greed is good” mentality is a regular feature of financial crises.
In particular, bonuses based on medium-term results of risky trades and investments must supplant bonuses based on short-term outcomes.

EUGENE – In 2010, I sat across the table from Assistant US Trade Representative Barbara Weisel, who was responsible for negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the mega-regional free-trade treaty among Vietnam, Malaysia, and ten other Pacific Rim countries that President Barack Obama’s administration wants to conclude in the coming weeks.
Weisel stated simply that “we have no position” on democracy.
But the TPP is not really a “trade” treaty at all. Rather, it is a vehicle for corporate lobbyists to achieve what they have been unable to persuade legislators to support through normal means.
At least for the Obama administration, the rush to conclude the TPP negotiations is doubtless driven by the desire to close the deal well ahead of America’s midterm election in November.
In his autobiography The World of Yesterday, Stefan Zweig described a similarly drastic change.

But he should have. The opposition quickly attacked the move as a “dangerous gimmick” and a “smokescreen.”
Such questions hide more basic ones: can the fulfillment of political goals really be quantified? Is it possible to evaluate a state in the same way that you evaluate a firm, thereby reducing its performance to a set of specific actions?
Thus, there is no contradiction between the aim of turning ministers into efficient managers and parliament’s power to hold members of the government accountable.
In Spain, despite tax hikes worth more than 4% of GDP since 2010, the tax-to-GDP ratio was only 38% in 2014, compared to 41% in 2007.

In that case, bankruptcies and fear of bankruptcy spawn an epidemic of further bankruptcies, reinforcing fear.
By contrast, our view (supported by plenty of data) is that rapidly rising prices usually reflect irrational exuberance, aided and abetted by phishes.
LONDON – The conventional view in mainstream economics today is that governments have little capacity to spark innovation. The state should play as limited a role in the economy as possible, the thinking goes, intervening only in cases of “market failure.”

BOGOTA–In January 2006, a few days after Evo Morales’ election as President of Bolivia, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez predicted that a new wave of left-wing governments would sweep across Latin America.
Around 48% of Nicaragua’s population is mired in poverty, with 79.9% living on less than two dollars a day.
But several previous Venezuelan governments presided over similar bonanzas, and few – if any – invested the resources in public projects and social initiatives, as Chávez has.
Grading Obamanomics
Obama would add $6.5 trillion to the United States’ national debt, more than all previous presidents, from George Washington to George W. Bush, combined.
Determining the size of likely losses is necessary to decide whether banks’ retained earnings from profitable ongoing operations and their ability to raise private capital will allow them to work down their toxic assets over time.
The big questions left unanswered are how far Obama wants to push the US toward a European-style social-welfare state, how he intends to pay for it, and how much long-term economic damage will result?

Likewise, France’s recent presidential election bolstered those who argue that Europe must grow its way out of its debt-heavy public sector, rather than aim for immediate fiscal orthodoxy.
The newly hired workers and newly formed businesses spend money, which induces more hiring, more start-ups, and yet more spending.
Expansive, growth-based policy could work better in Germany than in many eurozone countries for which it is being prescribed.
Magda Bianco, Silvia Giacomelli, and Giacomo Rodano, researchers at the Bank of Italy, report that these institutional roadblocks to expansion remain substantial in Italy.
With countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin American fearing that, having reached the international middle class, they could be stuck there, Greece and Argentina shed light on how that might happen.
Indeed, Greece may have dropped out of the high-income category in recent years.
Think of powerful business groups vetoing moves to improve tax collection or strengthen competition policy.
Greece exports refined petroleum products, olive oil, raw cotton, and dried fruit.
Greece has met its creditors’ demands far more than halfway. Yet Germany and Greece’s other creditors continue to demand that the country sign on to a program that has proven to be a failure, and that few economists ever thought could, would, or should be implemented.
A dose of reality on the part of Greece’s creditors – about what is achievable, and about the macroeconomic consequences of different fiscal and structural reforms – could provide the basis of an agreement that would be good not only for Greece, but for all of Europe.
We still don’t know the full extent of linkages among financial institutions, including those arising from non-transparent derivatives and credit default swaps.
The euro was supposed to strengthen it.
The future of Europe and the euro now depends on whether the eurozone’s political leaders can combine a modicum of economic understanding with a visionary sense of, and concern for, European solidarity.
In the end, outcomes may – and often do – depend on the amorphous yet essential qualities of integrity, trustworthiness, and interpersonal “chemistry.”
The six months of finger pointing and brinkmanship that preceded the deal have created a mountain of mistrust among leaders and citizens alike.
Given the lack of trust between the parties to the deal, the situation will remain extremely volatile for some time.
But the Iranians are nothing like the Nazis, and there is no country like the Soviet Union posing the kind of threat that inspired US President Richard Nixon to head to Beijing in 1972.
Indeed, the answer will become clear in a matter of months, or even weeks.
One might argue that the deal with Iran represents a fundamental shift in the country’s stance toward the West.
Greece had no such option.
But the deal can – and must – serve as the basis for saving Greece and the eurozone.
Yet the new deal anticipates that Greece will make up for the year’s fiscal shortfall in just five months.
Fiscal discipline should not take priority over the important structural reforms included in the new deal, particularly measures to overhaul pensions, the legal system, product markets, public administration, and the judiciary.
Meanwhile, Greek banks – which, given their huge volume of non-performing loans, are now more likely to be insolvent than illiquid – will require massive recapitalization, funded by the European Stability Mechanism, not the Greek state, in order to break the bank-sovereign link.
Economists who pretend that this would be anything less than an economic and political catastrophe for Greece should look closely at the structure of Greek trade, the anemic response of exports to the already huge internal devaluation, and company and household balance sheets.
Tsipras and his new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, have gone to extraordinary lengths to mollify Greece’s creditors.
Other European finance ministers will have to answer for agreeing to forward to their leaders a provisional draft containing Schäuble’s destructive language.
Finally, the privatization fund at the center of the new program will do nothing to encourage structural reform.
They must continue to push for a better deal.
Germany is demanding that Greece continue to service its debts in full, even though Greece is clearly broke and the International Monetary Fund has noted the need for debt relief.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has a clear negotiating strategy, aimed at getting Greece to agree to leave the eurozone.
There are plenty of precedents for such a course.
Specifically, the government should make clear to all Greeks that their euro deposits are safe; that the country will remain within the eurozone (despite the false claims by some members of the Eurogroup that a no vote means a Greek exit); and that its banks will reopen immediately after the referendum.
The result would be a win not only for those countries, but also for the world economy.
Public administration is in urgent need of modernization, and public resources must be used more efficiently.
The result of this method, in our government’s opinion, is an “austerity trap.”
The way to cure an ailing pension system is to cut pensions.
None of this means that common ground cannot be achieved immediately.
This approach has “worked” in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal, but at the cost of epic recessions.
In any case, faster GDP growth will pay for everything, thanks to high fiscal multipliers. Europe passed up a free lunch.
In Ireland and Spain, private bondholders, not Irish and Spanish taxpayers, should have taken the hit from bank failures.
Further aid to the European periphery is still badly needed.
In fact, Greece will likely depend on concessional funding from official sources in the years ahead – funding that is conditional on reforms, not debt ratios.
Greece may account for less than 2% of eurozone GDP, but the pursuit of shortsighted ad hoc solutions to its problems may set precedents that could bring down the entire monetary union.
To be sure, in recent years, the European institutional framework has undergone major reforms that reflect the principles of “Maastricht 2.0,” such as the need to emphasize national responsibility for public finances and international competitiveness.
In 2010, Europe and the International Monetary Fund extended loans to the insolvent Greek state equal to 44% of the country’s GDP.
Finally, in November, at the earliest, and after the first review of the new program is completed, “the Eurogroup stands ready to consider, if necessary, possible additional measures… aiming at ensuring that gross financing needs remain at a sustainable level.”
Unsustainable debt is, sooner or later, written down.
Life under it is becoming nasty, brutish and, for many of my compatriots, short.
A government's ability to redistribute wealth will also be limited if raising taxes causes capital or high-income earners to flee the country.
If they continued the reparation payments or attempted to negotiate with Germany's “creditors," they would have discredited themselves in the eyes of their supporters.
When democracy is used to justify shifting a country's burden onto its neighbors, integration becomes impossible – and both democracy and the international order may be jeopardized.
Unemployment stands at 25%. Youth unemployment is at 50%.
To be sure, European politicians are not blind to what is happening in Greece.
Such measures would likely require parliamentary votes in countries across the eurozone, where many governments would face intense public opposition – no matter how obvious the need.
Indeed, it is the type of heedlessness that led US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to let Lehman Brothers fail in September 2008, ostensibly to teach the market a “lesson.”
Should they press their demands, forcing Greece to exit, the world will never again trust the euro’s longevity.
But even the International Monetary Fund argued that contractions, such as cutbacks in government spending, were just that – contractionary.
Greece has also once again reminded us of how badly the world needs a debt-restructuring framework.
At the international level, we have not yet created an orderly process for giving countries a fresh start.
There is nothing particularly special about the dilemmas that Greece faces today; many&nbsp;countries have been in the same position.
If Europe says no to Greek voters’ demand for a change of course, it is saying that democracy is of no importance, at least when it comes to economics.
For starters, the IMF's Articles of Agreement require it to interact only with entities that are fully accountable for the help received: a member country's “treasury, central bank, stabilization fund, or other similar fiscal agency." But the institutions with which the IMF is dealing in the eurozone are no longer responsible for their country's macroeconomic management; that power lies with the European Central Bank.
This cast doubt on the transparency and accountability of the Fund's debt-sustainability projections.
CAMBRIDGE – When looking out a window, it is easy to be fooled by your own reflection and see more of yourself than the outside world.
But the truth is that the recession in Greece has little to do with an excessive debt burden.
Insufficient spending was never an issue.
In other words, unless Greece boosts exports, spending cuts will amplify the output loss in the same way that Keynesian multipliers amplified the output gain from borrowing.
But the bottom line is that Greece needs to develop its productive capabilities if it wants to grow.
In these scenarios, the most stable outcome tends to be a draw in which both sides are partly satisfied.
But his negotiating technique – unpredictable oscillations between aggressiveness and weakness – is the opposite of what game theory would dictate.
By focusing the QE debate on risk-sharing, Draghi managed to distract Germany from an infinitely more important issue: the enormous size of the QE program, which completely defied the German taboo against monetary financing of government debts.
Greece’s idealistic new leaders seem to believe that they can overpower bureaucratic opposition without the usual compromises and obfuscations, simply by brandishing their democratic mandate.
The only other possibility, if and when Greek banks start collapsing, would be an exit from the euro.
Athena sendiri memerlukan 22% lebih besar dari alam dibandingkan sumber daya yang dapat disediakan oleh ekosistemnya.

Today, with Greece facing many of the same challenges, it is worth taking a closer look at the lessons learned from Argentina’s crisis.
And yet, the widespread predictions of catastrophe did not come to pass.
The vast majority of economists (outside of Germany) agree that Greece’s debt should be written down and its fiscal policy relaxed.
Greece does need radical structural reform.
Argentina’s fourth lesson takes the form of a cautionary tale.
NEW YORK – The Greek euro tragedy is reaching its final act: it is clear that either this year or next, Greece is highly likely to default on its debt and exit the eurozone.
It took Germany ten years to restore its competitiveness this way; Greece cannot remain in a depression for a decade.
A similar “drachmatization” of euro debts would be necessary and unavoidable.
More importantly, the exit path would restore growth right away, via nominal and real depreciation, avoiding a decade-long depression.
The experience of Iceland and many emerging markets over the past 20 years shows that nominal depreciation and orderly restructuring and reduction of foreign debts can restore debt sustainability, competitiveness, and growth.
It would complete the fire sales within three years.
It did not have to be this way.
The Development Bank that we proposed would “allow the government to choose which assets are to be privatized and which not, while guaranteeing a greater impact on debt reduction from the selected privatizations.”
Barroso’s statement was meant to be reassuring.
Compared to 2007 and 2008, foreign investors’ holdings in emerging markets are much higher, owing to these countries’ relative economic strength in recent years and rock-bottom returns on developed-market financial assets.
The infrastructure for such cooperation has developed strongly since 2008, and China must not shy away from advocating its deployment.
As such, the PBoC will need to maintain counter-cyclical policies in order to avoid a deflationary spiral.
Of course, IMF governance reform will also need to be part of the discussion.
What the Greeks call democracy comes across in many other – equally democratic – countries as irresponsible unilateralism.
(Whether they did the right thing in 2012 by lending to Greece so that their own bankers could be repaid is a legitimate, but separate question.)
It need not have been this way.
After all, the terms on offer from the country’s creditors are unlikely to change much.
Economists around the world have condemned that target as punitive, because aiming for it will inevitably result in a deeper downturn.
But why would Europe do this?
And, sure enough, what we are seeing now, 16 years after the eurozone institutionalized those relationships, is the antithesis of democracy: Many European leaders want to see the end of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s leftist government.
I know how I would vote.
In that case, the event should have reflected that complexity.
But what is the justification for that confrontation? That they had the audacity to demand progress toward the rule of law and social justice, as well as efforts to tame Greece’s shipping magnates and its tax-avoiding clergy?
The countries of Central Europe that endured Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism do not need lessons in legitimacy from anyone – especially not the Greek prime minister.
The early poll was no surprise: almost a third of Tsipras’s colleagues in his leftist Syriza Party refused to endorse the bailout he had negotiated with the country’s creditors.
During the period of Greece’s accession to the eurozone, from 1994 to 2001, its economy stabilized.
But an alternative accounting method could also be used, registering expenditures when payments – in accordance with front-loaded schedules – were actually made.
Optimists will note that the underlying fiscal situation in Greece is healthier.
Just going from one crisis to the next will ruin the economy for decades to come – and will exhaust the patience of even the most sympathetic of Greece’s partners.
The theory behind structural reforms is simple: opening the economy to competition will increase the efficiency with which resources are allocated.
To place this number in perspective, remember that Greek GDP has shrunk by 25% since 2009.
Of course, Greece lacks the most direct instrument for achieving this – currency depreciation – owing to its eurozone membership.
But, as successful countries around the world have discovered, a best-practice mindset does not help much in promoting new exports.
Syriza’s economic program rejects the austerity policies supported – or, some might say, imposed – by the so-called “troika” (the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank, and the European Commission).
Moreover, a debt reduction in the form of further interest-rate reductions and maturity extensions on foreign government-held debt would not hurt financial markets.
Such an outcome would be even more disheartening in light of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris, and after unity marches in France and across the continent rekindled a long-fading sense of European solidarity.
A Greek exit from the euro is not a more viable solution today than it was three years ago.
A credible commitment by Greece to sound macroeconomic policies requires adjusting the troika’s targets to reflect realities.
What is needed now is a new reform-oriented agreement – one that recognizes the need for measures to be implemented in the right sequence, delaying those that will have a recessionary effect.
Third, Greece needs a sound and predictable legal system.
In fact, many of its policies – most notably, the new education bill – have been regressive.
If the government embraces this agenda, the troika should reward it with debt relief, both by extending loan maturities and by lowering interest rates.
Already, Greek voters handed the far-left anti-austerity Syriza party a sweeping victory in January.
This would increase already-high unemployment, expose excessive financial risk-taking, embolden Russia, and strengthen populist movements further, thereby impeding comprehensive policy responses.
The rescue program designed to keep Greece from crashing out of the eurozone has raised the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio from 130% at the start of the crisis in 2009 to more than 170% today, with the International Monetary Fund predicting that the debt burden could reach 200% of GDP in the next two years.
Dependence on aid undermines the implicit contract between citizens and their government, according to which politicians must keep taxpayers satisfied in order to stay in office.
Cutting the umbilical cord in a relationship of aid dependency is never easy, and there is no reason to expect that it will be any different with Greece.
First, the new loans did not represent a bailout for Greece so much as a cynical transfer of private losses from the banks’ books onto the shoulders of Greece’s most vulnerable citizens.
Similarly, European citizens should have demanded that their governments refuse even to consider transferring private losses to them.
In practical terms, the February 20 Eurogroup agreement, which provided a four-month extension for loan repayments, offers an important opportunity for progress.
If this mismanagement continues, not only Greece but also European unity will be fatally undermined.
Greek officials have repeatedly tried to discuss the need to restructure the debt by slashing interest rates, extending maturities, and perhaps cutting the face value of the debt as well.
Yet the failure of the European institutions is more alarming.
Its analysis has been by far the most professional and least politicized.
The decisions taken by Europe in the next several days will determine Greece’s fate; wittingly or not, they will determine the EU’s fate as well.
Nor can it withstand the inevitable attacks directed against EU institutions for every action and regulation that citizens dislike and for which national politicians want to avoid responsibility.
For the US, those questions arose in the 1840s and 1850s, when the urgent need for a union to secure independence had faded, causing issues and conflicts that had been papered over to resurface.
For the EU to continue its march toward a stronger and closer polity and economy –one that nevertheless falls far short of a federal state – it must offer the credible prospect of a better life for all of its citizens.
It is for this reason that Greece and Germany, its largest creditor, need a new modus vivendi in order to resume negotiations.
When Germany faced comparable conditions in the early 1930s, its creditors shrugged, and the resulting instability allowed for the rise of Adolf Hitler.
Tsipras’s response to these provocations has been clear and consistent: Greece should stay in the eurozone, and it needs a fresh financial start to do so.
With the promise of deep debt relief for Greece and a rapprochement between Greece and Germany, economic confidence will return.
It is not.
The eurozone’s political leaders agreed to start negotiations on a much larger package, worth €86 billion, almost half of Greece’s GDP.
The bitter dispute within the Eurogroup (comprising the eurozone countries’ finance ministers) not only strained relations among the monetary union’s members, but also fueled tensions within national governments.
The rules were indeed violated, but whether the bailout decision rescued the euro remains to be seen.
These countries’ governments would then have felt compelled to rescue tottering banks with their taxpayers’ money.
The lesson to be drawn from the Greek debacle is that the eurozone must develop sovereign insolvency procedures as quickly as possible, thereby preventing other sovereigns from becoming creditors through debt mutualization.
Three weeks ago, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde’s called for talks to resume “with adults in the room.”
It has been clear for five years that Greece’s debts are unsustainable.
A rational banker might deliberately provoke bankruptcy and suffer larger write-offs than necessary, in order to teach lessons and create better future incentives.
And yet, if you replace “Illinois” with Ireland, Spain, or Greece, that is how things work in the eurozone.
Adult negotiators have to face two realities: large debt write-offs are inevitable, and punishing Greece further will not put the eurozone on the path to financial discipline.
A professor of game theory, Varoufakis recently boasted to the New York Times that “little Greece, in order to survive, [could] bring down the financial world,” and that his media image “as an irrational fool… is doing my work for me” by frightening other EU finance ministers.
Before January, this sequence of events was quite likely, but the ECB’s bond-buying program put a firebreak at each point of the contagion process. If holders of Portuguese bonds are alarmed by a future Greek default, the ECB will simply increase its bond buying; with no limit to its buying power, it will easily overwhelm any selling pressure.
Spanish ten-year bonds, for example, are still trading at interest rates below US Treasuries.
Another crucial innovation has been the development of the European Stability Mechanism, which, like the International Monetary Fund, has the capacity to execute vast financial bailouts, subject to conditionality.
Germans have a point when they argue that complaints about “austerity” ought to be directed at Greece’s previous governments.
Third, Greece’s eurozone partners wield a massive stick that is typically absent in sovereign-debt negotiations.
PRINCETON – Greece's new government, led by the anti-austerity Syriza party, presents the eurozone with a challenge that it has not yet had to face: dealing with national officials who are outside the traditional European mainstream.
And just about the only bargaining chip that Varoufakis holds may be the implicit threat that Greece could leave the euro ("Grexit").
Consider the first condition.
The resulting uncertainty about policies and prices might produce a severe adverse shock on the real economy, sending unemployment to even greater heights.
Since the onset of the crisis, Greek wages have dropped by more than 15% – a process called, appropriately enough, internal devaluation.
Greek Lessons for Europe
In that case, the euro would be in danger of failing, for the first time seriously imperiling the entire project of European integration.
The current crisis has, however, also shown that the Council of Finance Ministers (Ecofin) is unable to assert such control over EU member states’ fiscal policies.
What is necessary now is statesman-like leadership – and even more so states woman -like leadership.
Democracy is compatible with national sovereignty only if we restrict globalization.
They understood that democratic countries would need the space to conduct independent monetary and fiscal policies.
The EU’s difficulties stem from the fact that the global financial crisis caught Europe midway through a similar process.
They could not stop the Greek government from borrowing (indirectly) from the European Central Bank (ECB) as long as credit rating agencies deemed Greek debt creditworthy.
The choice that the EU faces is the same in other parts of the world: either integrate politically, or ease up on economic unification.
With the government lacking fiscal room, and Greek banks burdened by non-performing loans, it is important to mobilize the state’s remaining assets and unclog the flow of bank credit to healthy parts of the private sector.
One can easily imagine Greece recovering strongly as a result of this strategy.
Only the bright light of democratic transparency can remove such impediments; our government is determined to help it shine through.
The IMF seems to have lent Greece such a large amount for political reasons.
In South Korea, net private-capital inflows of 4.8% of GDP in 1996 swung to net outflows of 3.4% of GDP in 1997.
Greece, by contrast, has utterly failed to engineer a recovery.
Many have questioned whether agonizing reforms are entirely necessary; if the country returned to the drachma, they suggest, it could implement interest-rate cuts and devalue its exchange rate, thereby engineering an export-led recovery.
Indeed, the outcome could determine whether the country remains in the eurozone, with far-reaching implications for the rest of the monetary union.
But, at the end of 2014, public debt amounted to 175% of GDP, having increased from its 2009 level of 127%.
Such an approach would strengthen Syriza’s position in debt-relief negotiations.
But it would do nothing to address the real problem: the increasing economic divergence among eurozone countries.
That story was repeated by media organizations worldwide.
The theory grew out of the experience of the southern United States, where many jurisdictions required stores to close on Sunday, thus preventing the sale of alcohol.
Of course, he would also have been one of the major investors in the wind-power and natural-gas companies that would benefit from government subsidies.
Businesses see opportunities for taxpayer-funded subsidies, and to pass on inevitable cost growth to consumers.
Factories and mines make up the rest.
California’s latest building and appliance standards are expected to avoid the need for five large power plants in the next 10 years.
Each year, it adds more new energy generation capacity than the installed base of the United Kingdom.
Repeated studies have shown that well-designed buildings are more comfortable.
Tenants need to take the same care with buildings that they do with cars.
Likewise, there is economic value produced when wastewater is naturally cleaned by wetlands, but no transaction has occurred, so it is not counted in GDP.
Such information is crucial for making good decisions.
The Nakivubo Swamp is not a case of economic logic prevailing, but exactly the opposite – a failure to consider all options and choose the best.
In practice, green accounting might easily have led our forefathers not to cut down forests, because this would entail losing a valuable resource.
But, to be successful, a “green new deal” will have to address some enormous challenges in the developing world, where the impact of global warming will be felt first and hardest, and where rapid growth requires massive expansion of cheap energy.
The problem is that these are currently much more costly options than their carbon-heavy alternatives.
This time, moreover, the burden will not fall on one country alone, and a broader mix of traditional and innovative sources of financing are already available to help fund the required investment programs in energy efficiency and renewables.
At that point, global policymakers got religion and started to use most of the weapons in their arsenal: vast fiscal-policy easing; conventional and unconventional monetary expansion; trillions of dollars in liquidity support, recapitalization, guarantees, and insurance to stem the liquidity and credit crunch; and, finally, massive support to emerging-market economies.
This will be bad news for consumption and the size of bank losses.
Seventh, monetization of fiscal deficits is not inflationary in the short run, whereas slack product and labor markets imply massive deflationary forces.
But, despite the goal of unity and collective action underpinning the summit, the best way forward for the global economy is to build on the actions that individual countries and regions are taking in pursuit of their own interests.
Yet today’s global economy is all we have, so we need to make the most of it in driving forward the green changes that are needed.
Shaping unilateralism requires new ways to collaborate, and such platforms are emerging.
Greenspan Hypnotizes Himself
So Mr. Greenspan decided to extend a peace offering to the Europeans.
In any case, protecting exports by resisting euro appreciation – or, more precisely, dollar depreciation – is a poor way to promote economic growth.
Simply put, there must be dollar depreciation to keep global imbalances in check.
Other countries' fate would be called into question, as occurred during the Asian currency crises of 1997-98 or the European sovereign-debt crisis of 2010-2012.
But it does not follow that the loss would be harmless.
None of this is currently lethal, owing to the initiatives taken in recent years; but it would be a mistake to assume that full confidence has been restored.
None of this means that eurozone members should be ready to pay whatever cost is needed to keep Greece inside the eurozone.
The situation in Syria feels more and more like what we witnessed in Bosnia 20 years ago.
Yet it was accomplished for more than a decade in neighboring Iraq to keep Saddam Hussein from attacking segments of his own population, so we know that it can be done in Syria as well.
And, while the participation of the US, which has by far the greatest logistical capacity, is essential, it should not be in the forefront.
This points to a systemic dimension of the crisis that cannot be reduced to profligate behavior by fiscal sinners.
Core countries, meanwhile, argue that they can do little to strengthen aggregate demand and relieve pressure on their partners, even as the periphery’s agony is dragging the core into recession, owing to its dependence on peripheral export markets.
At their meeting at the end of June, European leaders acknowledged for the first time the multiple dimensions of the crisis, accepting that austerity – putting everyone’s house in order – will not suffice.
The sizeable investments required to make up for the loss of nuclear energy may contribute more immediate stimulus.
For example, GDP growth in Brazil has slowed sharply, from 7.5% in 2010 to 2.7% in 2011 and to just 0.9% in 2012, while India’s growth rate slowed from 10.5% to 3.2% over the same period.
Given this, China’s economic slowdown since the first quarter of 2010 has apparently been caused mainly by external and cyclical factors.
How much faster is an empirical question. According to the Growth Commission led by Nobel laureate Michael Spence, 13 economies took full advantage of their latecomer status after World War II and achieved annual GDP growth rates of 7% or higher – at least twice as high as developed countries’ growth rates – for 25 years or longer.
To realize its potential growth as a latecomer, China needs, above all, to deepen its market-oriented reforms, address various structural problems, and develop its economy according to its comparative advantages.
I went to Bhutan to understand better how GNH is being applied.
The first concerned the environmental devastation that he could observe – including the retreat of glaciers and the loss of land cover – as he flew from Bhutan to India.
The question of how to guide an economy to produce sustainable happiness – combining material well-being with human health, environmental conservation, and psychological and cultural resiliency – is one that needs addressing everywhere.
Bhutan has embarked on such a serious journey.
You may recall the story of Richard Nixon attending the independence celebrations in Ghana.
But – and here comes the real hit – carbon-dioxide emissions grew seventeen-fold.
Let me explain.
British voters line up behind the truck drivers when protests are launched against hikes in the price of petrol, not least through the introduction of higher energy taxes.
History is said to repeat itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.
Although China’s government does not keep any of its international commitments on economic, social, and cultural rights, the world’s democracies appear to have lost their willingness to stand up for their beliefs, as President Barack Obama’s kowtow to China during his November visit painfully demonstrated.
That route will lead only to moral and political decay.
A closed society will eventually return to a closed economy.
But financial deregulation in the 1980’s ushered us into uncharted territory.
Thus, many financial institutions, especially the largest, operate with an implicit government guarantee.
To grasp the rationale for a more broad-based approach to financial regulation, consider three other regulated industries: drugs, tobacco, and firearms.
As a result, most advanced societies impose direct controls on gun ownership.
The task for governments is to commit to putting this focus on wellbeing into practice.
As a measure of policy success, GDP is particularly poorly suited to countries with large public sectors.
The fourth key insight is that indicators of wellbeing interact.
CAMBRIDGE – “Life,” Oscar Wilde famously said, “imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life.”
Most important, information is no longer sequestered in a virtual realm, but permeates the environment in which we live.
Malicious hackers are difficult to combat with traditional government and industry tools – the Sony Pictures case being a telling example.
Similar to traditional military command-and-control protocols, they gain power in numbers and can quickly react to a broad array of attacks.
On current indications, the amount Americans will give to relief efforts in Haiti could surpass the $1.9 billion they gave to assist victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami, which until now has stood as a record for donations to a disaster outside the United States.
Why do people give generously to earthquake victims, but not to prevent the much larger number of deaths brought about by extreme poverty, insufficient food, unsafe water, lack of sanitation, and the absence of even the most basic health care?
The people who contributed to this drop by delivering effective basic health care, building a supply of safe water, or immunizing children against measles remain largely unknown.
What should we do? Brian Tucker, founder of the non-profit organization Geohazards International, urges that 10% of the money raised by relief efforts should be set aside for mitigating damage from future earthquakes: training builders, improving engineering, and making the public more aware of the risks and how to reduce them.
The Haitian Ministry of Public Health reports that the number of deaths is approaching 2,000, with the number of infections exceeding 80,000.
They are providing water-purification materials, carrying out large-scale public-information campaigns, and helping to build treatment centers.
It is vital that the Haitian people in all communities are fully informed about how to deal with this disease, and that they understand that cholera is quickly cured when diagnosed and treated quickly.
Millions of people look to the international community for immediate survival.
But, at the end of the day, Haitians can stand only on their own.
A believer in the essentially political nature of Haiti’s tragedy, Fernandez rightly aspires to turn the current crisis into the lever for state-building, Haiti’s extraction from political isolation, and its maturation into an active member of the regional and world community.
The Dominicans are right to seek at least a more solid regional commitment.
Precisely because developing a mutually beneficial border regime is, as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rightly remarked in her 2009 visit to the island, a task that affects the two countries’ stability and well-being, it also needs to be part of the current international reconstruction effort.
The scenes of devastation are still vivid in the streets and neighborhoods of Gaza, and Hamas is taking no chances of provoking Israel into a new war.
President Mahmoud Abbas has made no secret of his objection to such a strategy.
Abbas has repeatedly described peace as a strategic choice for the Palestinians.
Fayyad has also gained the backing of Fatah and most other Palestinian groups in the West Bank.
Palestinian politics is approaching the point of no return.
The confrontations have come at a time when Abbas has been trying to persuade Hamas to moderate its anti-Israel stance and ally with Fatah in a national unity government.
With the Gaza Strip in its backyard, Egypt has already mediated several times between Hamas and Fatah, and has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to arrange a swap of prisoners with Israel following Hamas’s abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.
Israel might not wait for Abbas and his forces, but rather launch a full-scale intervention to weaken Hamas.
The Hamas victory is, first and foremost, an indication of the total failure of the traditional Palestinian leadership to create a body politic.
It was not only the endemic corruption of the official Palestinian leadership that turned so many Palestinians from it.
Hence, Israel must start deciding the future boundaries of the country unilaterally, hoping for eventual negotiations at a later stage.
One surely that EU diplomacy has sought to bring about.
In this case, Abbas would leave Annapolis in a stronger position and thus be better able to negotiate with Hamas to establish a national unity government.
Such an arrangement can establish the strong popular legitimacy that the Palestinians will need at the negotiating table in order to make any real compromise.
Hamas’s Real Enemies
Given their strong self-interest in thwarting Islamist revolutionary groups, especially those aligned with Iran, they are not inclined to listen to the “Arab street” – which is far quieter than it was during previous conflicts, such as the 1991 war in Kuwait, the 2000-2004 Palestinian uprising, or the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.
An aspect of this is that the largely Sunni Muslim-led states face a largely Shia Muslim-led competitor for regional hegemony.
Such a campaign actually disheartens the relative moderates who, feeling sold out, will try to cut their own deal with Tehran.
What should you do?
According to recent reports, Hamas’s senior officials are currently hiding in hospitals.
Not unreasonably, Israel wants an internationally guaranteed and monitored ceasefire agreement that would put a total stop to Hamas assaults against its territory.
Olmert, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and Foreign Minister Tzippi Livni have cast aside their political rivalries in order to orchestrate an answer: Israel must fight off the Gazan rockets.
Israel has gone a long way since the Arab world set out to kill it off.
Nevertheless, in Gaza’s political milieu, Hamas is a moderate Islamic group that opposes al-Qaeda-style extremism.
In a recent declaration, the group made favorable mention of al-Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
While traditional Salafi movements have stayed away from politics, the younger groups see activism and violence as the best means of realizing their goals.
With hundreds of tunnels connecting the Gaza Strip and Sinai, it is very difficult to control the flow of arms, ammunition, and possibly foreign fighters.
Altogether, Italian GDP has contracted by 9% during the past seven years.
What Italy managed in the past by devaluing the lira must now be emulated through so-called real depreciation.
Even if a country’s trade unions enable such a policy through wage moderation, debtors would run into difficulties, because they borrowed on the assumption that high inflation would continue.
Renzi is not alone in this.
The Doha Round of WTO talks was a flop, and the agreement reached in Bali last year, despite being sold as a success, does little more than accelerate the collection of customs duties.
But these benefits are far from guaranteed.
But it is not acceptable for the EU to offer foreign investors protection from a European country’s inability to meet its obligations, in particular to service its debt.
More dramatically, people in Austria, France, Japan, and Germany appear to be no happier than people in much poorer countries, like Brazil, Colombia, and the Philippines.
Instead of having more time for leisure, they spent more time at and commuting to work.
For nomadic societies, there was no point in owning anything that one could not carry, but once humans settled down and developed a system of money, that limit to acquisition disappeared.
Coincidentally, Kahneman’s article appeared the same week that Buffett announced the largest philanthropic donation in US history – $30 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and another $7 billion to other charitable foundations.
So the question now is not whether to increase aid, but how best to finance it.
However, opaque solutions designed to avoid critical public scrutiny do not seem particularly democratic.
Above all, SDR’s represent liquidity and can be allocated only if and when there is a “global need,” which would currently be difficult to prove given highly liquid and “easy” international capital-market conditions.
Moreover, the IMF’s share in crisis countries’ total external debt has reached unprecedented and systemically problematic levels.
Since the financial crisis began in 2008, several developed countries, having sustained demand with excessive leverage and consumption, have had to repair both private and public balance sheets, which takes time – and has left them impaired in terms of growth and employment.
The hard truth is that the flip side of the consumption-led growth model that prevailed prior to the crisis has been deficient investment, particularly on the public-sector side.
Particularly in the US, employment generation has been disproportionately in the non-tradable sector.
As a result, deleveraging remains a clear priority in a range of countries, reducing growth, with fiscal countermeasures limited by high or rising government debt and deficits.
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu’s “zero conflicts with neighbors” approach gave this re-orientation its strategic and theoretical foundation.
While initially viewed as pacific and moderate, it was underpinned by an overarching view of Turkey as the hegemonic regional power – as an arbiter of conflicts, but ultimately also as an enforcer of its own views on lesser players.
A new sultanate? Erdoğan as the new Saladin?
Even within this framework, the negotiations were challenging. So how did 44 disparate powers, each seeking to protect its own national interests, manage to agree on a new global monetary system?
The bilateral nature of the negotiations certainly implies that they have a chance. But there was another critical factor underpinning the success of the Bretton Woods conference: the global political and security environment.
Are they? And should they even want to be?
Unlike China, a large trade power with underdeveloped monetary and financial capabilities, the eurozone meets the requirement of systemic significance in all three areas.
These deficits raise persistent concerns about the system’s viability, with observers (mostly outside the US) having long predicted its imminent demise.
Despite the 2008 financial crisis, the US remains the undisputed leader in global finance.
PRINCETON – Though a solution to the euro crisis continues to elude European leaders, the foundations of one are not difficult to discern.
This time, the Germans won, with a spectacular display of power in a 7-1 semifinal erasure of the host country, Brazil, and a 1-0 triumph over Argentina in the final.
Something needed to be shaken up.
There are other lessons that Germans and Europeans can derive from these experiences.
Consistent, reliable, long-term success requires forward-thinking measures that focus on building strong fundamentals.
The most significant meetings took place on September 16 and October 28 – in the aftermath of the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers – and focused on the creation of bilateral currency-swap agreements aimed at ensuring adequate liquidity.
By contrast, the International Monetary Fund has finite resources provided by member countries.
Even the Swiss representative condemned the measure.
PRINCETON – History matters, but in different ways.
But 1914 is not the only possible or attractive point of comparison in interpreting Britain’s past.
The film’s director, Vladimir Khotinenko, said that it was important that his audience “didn’t regard it as something that happened in ancient history but as a recent event… that they felt the link between what happened 400 years ago and today.”
That is why it is France that must make the gesture of pardon....It is only I who can reconcile France and Germany, because only I can raise Germany from its decadence.”
Today, Europe’s fringes, by contrast, appear determined to escape into it.
Even the newly formed Alternative for Germany – which did unexpectedly well in the recent election, finishing just short of the 5% threshold needed to enter the Bundestag – insists that its anti-euro agenda is not anti-Europe.
Maybe the royal family will go back to styling itself the House of Hanover?
Roughly every hundred years since the Lutheran Reformation, the number of independent German political units has fallen by a factor of ten.
According to official data, more than 160,000 farmers have committed suicide in India since 1997.
The creation of seed monopolies is based on the deregulation of seed corporations, including giving them oversight over bio-safety.
This was a period when Monsanto and its Indian partner, Mahyco, were also carrying out illegal field experiments with genetically engineered Bt cotton.
For farmers, it translates into suicide.
Roughly 18,000 children died daily as a direct or indirect consequence of malnutrition.
The problem is that, having neglected food security and the productive sectors of their economies for several decades, many developing countries’ governments now lack the fiscal capacity to increase public spending in order to increase food production and agricultural productivity.
However, cutting farm subsidies will increase food prices, at least initially, while reducing agricultural tariffs alone will not necessarily lead to an increase in food production in poor countries without complementary support.
Of course, economic forecasters have generally been far too optimistic at every turn of late, so the public is understandably leery of their prognostications.
One hopes that President-elect Obama’s all-star economic team will at least adopt a coherent and consistent policy.
Recessions have important cleansing effects, helping to facilitate painful restructuring.
But these regions are nevertheless mired in recession.
Fidel’s appearance at the Party’s congress – an event full of political significance, because he has only rarely participated in public events since becoming sick in 2006 – seemed to confirm his support for this outcome.
Indeed, there are talks centered on debt, with some creditors interested in the mechanics of capitalization.
Migration, an option financed by remittances from relatives in the United States, was not made any more flexible, either.
Has Economic Power Replaced Military Might?
Many crucial issues, such as financial stability or climate change, simply are not amenable to military force.
The European Union’s soft power at the end of the Cold War, and that of China today, owes much to the success of the EU and Chinese economic models.
Markets and economic power rest upon political frameworks, which in turn depend not only upon norms, institutions, and relationships, but also upon the management of coercive power.
But, while it does sometimes appear that the current crisis is due, at least in part, to financial innovation, financial-market liberalization has been shown to be a good thing overall.
The US is one of the world’s most financially liberal countries.
Mayhew concluded that it is rather difficult to tell whether derivative markets worsen financial-market volatility, because their creation tends to come when existing financial markets already are more volatile, or can be predicted to become so.
So, we should not slow down financial innovation in general.
Indeed, more than a dozen emerging-market economies now face severe financial pressures: Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine in Europe; Indonesia, Korea, and Pakistan in Asia; and Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela in Latin America.
Traditionally, central banks have been the lenders of last resort, but now they are becoming the lenders of first and only resort.
NEW YORK – The recent annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Lima, Peru, were dominated by talk of the weakness of several emerging and developing economies.
The Belgian economist Robert Triffin first identified this problem – dubbed the “Triffin dilemma” – in the 1960s, emphasizing the fundamental conflict between national objectives, such as limiting the size of the external deficit, and international imperatives, such as creating enough liquidity to satisfy demand for reserve assets.
The first step toward making SDRs a more active force in global finance would be to remove the division between SDR accounts and normal IMF operations.
Some five decades after Triffin first identified the problems with the US dollar’s reserve-currency status, the SDR’s moment has, one hopes, finally arrived.
Such efficiency gains from increasing the extent of the market and promoting specialization should have produced rapid growth in Mexican productivity.
To be sure, economic deficiencies still abound in Mexico.
OXFORD – Throughout the history of the oil industry, fear and concern about the imminent exhaustion of oil reserves has been a recurring theme.
But the track record of “peak oil” theorists on such matters has not been impressive: their predictions have steadily moved forward the date that global oil production will peak.
Reserves are defined as the quantities of petroleum that are expected to be commercially recoverable from known fields.
Some who believe in the imminence of peak oil consider these barriers essentially irrelevant, arguing that their removal would merely delay the peak for a few years.
But, after last month’s presidential election returned Putin to the office, the protest wave rapidly subsided.
But there was no real victory for the country’s power elite; nor was society defeated.
And Moscow is not the only example.
What we can say for sure is that only a democratic Russia will be able to survive within the country’s current borders.
How carefully can one plan for the long term in, say, the eurozone, if the currency itself is at risk? And how long should brick-and-mortar retailers’ time horizons be if distribution is moving online?
For stock markets, the difference may be important.
The average holding duration for each shareholder is three years.
They find that holding durations for two of America’s primary shareholders, Fidelity and Vanguard, have not budged since 1985.
In that sense, it is reasonable to say that the worst of the downturn is now probably behind us.
Moreover, disposable personal income rose in the first quarter only because of a massive jump in tax rebates and government pension payments. In contrast, salaries, self-employment income, dividends, and interest all fell.
So, by the end of the year, we will see a slightly improved level of GDP, but the rate of GDP growth is likely to return to negative territory.
Moreover, China is already the world’s largest oil importer, and energy demand continues to increase rapidly.
At the same time, given slower growth in world markets and the challenges of domestic structural adjustment, the annual growth target has been reduced, to around 7.5%.
With this mix of policies, Chinese carbon emissions could peak by 2030, even as the economy grows at a rate of 4-5%.
The global nature of environmental challenges creates an important opportunity for international cooperation based on shared interest.
There is nothing new about that insight, but now it is easier to keep track of personal behavior.
In my own case, I behave pretty well already: I swim for 50 minutes a day, I floss regularly, I eat sensibly, and so forth.
An existing service in which I plan to invest, www.GetUpandMove.me, allows you to challenge a friend: “I will swim for 50 minutes if Alice runs around the block four times.”
More convincing will be data shared by individuals and collected (with permission) by third parties.
A referendum on autonomy which was approved in May in Bolivia’s eastern province of Santa Cruz has generated fear about the region’s eventual secession.
The inauguration of Morales, an indigenous leader, was a political earthquake, but it was also a sign of deepening democracy.
But, while the relative power of Bolivia’s diverse regions is increasing, none can survive alone or veto the actions of highly mobilized zones of the country.
More democracy and material welfare probably can co-exist with realistic local autonomy, whereas partition, it should be remembered, does not always breed political pluralism, social cohesion, and economic well-being.
Many chemical mediators are involved, including cortisol and adrenalin from the adrenal glands, other hormones and neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and noradrenalin), and responses from the autonomic and immune systems.
For example, levels of the stress hormone cortisol increase in the evening, when they are normally low.
If so, new, the new antidepressants would have to target what appear to be progressive neurodegenerative changes in the brain, which we infer are taking place because recurrence of depression is so high under currently available treatments.
Several decades ago, the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington argued that economic prosperity in developing countries with weak governing institutions would not necessarily lead to political stability.
Indeed, extraction of a country’s wealth for use by the elite can occur even in democratic societies when those who dominate the political system face no constraints other than periodic elections.
The Swiss proceedings were stopped at the request of the Pakistani government when Zardari became president.



The new wave of innovation is attributable to three key factors: the ability to personalize therapy, the capacity to get treatments to market faster, and improved engagement with patients.
With this approach, research can begin in as little as three weeks, compared to the 34 weeks, on average, for a standard trial.
But they are just the beginning.
Airlines and hotels have known this for a long time.
How do you translate healthy behavior into status? First, of course, you can have cards identifying your compliance behavior – e.g., not how many drugs you take, but how regularly you take them.
Its initial service, at http://imoveyou.com, allows you to challenge someone else by filling in a form, which is then published on the person’s Facebook wall or on Twitter.
While the service is currently designed for individuals, companies could also use HealthRally to enhance their corporate wellness programs.
Finally, the car carries no warranty.
He parks this $10 million in Treasury bills, too, and sells another 10 million options. This nets him another $1 million, which he uses to cover expenses.
So when the event eventually does occur, investors who leave their money in the fund lose everything, whereas Oz nets more than $3 million in each year before the fund crashes.
Requiring managers to apprise investors of downside exposure would help even more.
Perhaps the most notable consequence of Spain’s recent reform efforts is its current-account surplus – the country’s first in more than two decades. At the peak of the crisis, Spain’s current-account deficit amounted to an unprecedented 10% of GDP.
The most potent threat to Spain’s economic recovery stems from the labor market.
OXFORD – It is now a near certainty that, by the end of this year, falling energy and commodity prices will push annual inflation in the eurozone below zero – well under the European Central Bank’s target of near 2%.
Another factor impeding QE’s impact in the eurozone is low bond yields, which, by increasing measured pension-fund deficits, make some companies reluctant to invest and thus more likely to raise contribution rates and limit pension benefits.
Another alternative would be to use the electoral register, a public database that the ECB could use independently of governments.
HELSINKI – One early result of today’s global recession is that many donor governments are trimming their foreign aid programs.
Few decision-makers seem aware of this.
Cape Verde received 34% of its GDP from remittances, Eritrea 38% and Burundi 23%.
In West Africa, a simple money transfer operator now handles 70% of official payments and also imposes exclusivity on banks.
Its signatories recognized a direct link between political and military issues and human rights concerns – and that this link is a fundamental component of peace and security.
The high-level Panel of Eminent Persons on European Security as a Common Project, established at the Basel Ministerial Council by last year’s Swiss OSCE chairmanship, provided invaluable insights when they presented their Interim Report on European security at the Munich Security Conference Core Group Meeting in Vienna this week.
Simply put, without a shared approach to security and a dedicated joint response, overcoming our current challenges will be virtually impossible.
The platform is already in place. Let us get to work – together.
Moreover, though composting receives good press as a “green” practice, it generates a significant amount of greenhouse gases (and is often a source of pathogenic bacteria in crops).
Another limitation of organic production is that it works against the best approach to enhancing soil quality – namely, the minimization of soil disturbance (such as that caused by plowing or tilling), combined with the use of cover crops.
But that reflects science-based research and old-fashioned technological ingenuity on the part of farmers, plant breeders, and agribusiness companies, not irrational opposition to modern insecticides, herbicides, genetic engineering, and “industrial agriculture.”
लेकिन, लंबी अवधि में, सबसे बड़ा वरदान, खाद्य सुरक्षा और पर्यावरण दोनों के लिए, संभवतः नई फसल किस्मों की सूखे क�� अवधियों और अन्य जल-संबंधी तनावों को सहन करने की क्षमता होगा। सिंचाई के लिए उपयोग किए जानेवाले पानी की मात्रा में थोड़ी-सी कमी से भी, विशेष रूप से सूखे की स्थितियों में, भारी लाभ हो सकते हैं।
इसके लाभों को देखते हुए, यह उम्मीद की जा सकती है कि ऐसी घटनाओं की सर्वत्र सराहना की जाएगी और उन्हें प्रोत्साहित किया जाएगा। लेकिन इन्हें भारी विनियामक बाधाओं का सामना करना पड़ता है। उदाहरण के लिए, यूरोप काफी हद तक जेनेटिक इंजीनियरिंग (जीई) की फसलों पर प्रतिबंध लगाता है; भारत ने कीट-प्रतिरोधी कपास को तो मंजूरी दी है, लेकिन उसने किसी प्रकार की खाद्य फसलों के लिए मंजूरी नहीं दी है। जहाँ जीई फसलों की खेती की भी जा रही है, वहाँ अवैज्ञानिक और जरूरत से ज्यादा भारी विनियमन के फलस्वरूप फसलों की नई किस्मों के उत्पादन की लागत में भारी वृद्धि हुई है, जिससे कई संभावित महत्वपूर्ण फसलें बाजार से बाहर हैं।
Many people purchase organic foods in order to avoid exposure to harmful levels of pesticides.
For example, the EU’s policy notes that “foreseen flexibility rules” can compensate for “local climatic, cultural, or structural differences.”
Finally, many who are seduced by the romance of organic farming ignore its human consequences.
In September, an eminent group of scientists called upon the scientific community to “stand together in staunch opposition to the violent destruction of required tests on valuable advances, such as golden rice, that have the potential to save millions” of people from “needless suffering and death.”
The assumption that “genetically engineered” or “genetically modified” is a meaningful – and dangerous – classification has led not only to vandalism of field trials, but also to destruction of laboratories and assaults on researchers.
In many places, the location of field trials now must be identified, even including GPS coordinates – a practice that facilitates vandalism.
Unfortunately, it is the wrong question.
When Russia annexed Crimea last March, Kadri Liik of the European Council on Foreign Relations pointed out the marked difference in the way it handled its invasion of Georgia in 2008.
Many of these global threats are closely intertwined with war, but war that is far more likely to be fought within borders than across them.
Yet today, faced with a virus that kills half of those it infects and the prospect that it could decimate an entire region of Africa, disrupt air travel, and put people around the world in quarantine, the world has delivered only a fraction of the needed financial and material assistance.
But we are in extraordinary times, and the government has taken and is prepared to take unprecedented measures.
During the Great Depression, many debt contracts were indexed to gold.
As during the Great Depression and in many debt restructurings, it makes sense in the current contingency to mandate partial debt forgiveness or a debt-for-equity swap in the financial sector.
Perubahan Zat-zat Aman menjadi Berbahaya
Di awal tahun ini, Environmental Protection Agency di Amerika Serikat (EPA) menyimpulkan bahwa “berdasarkan pertimbangan bobot bukti atas data yang tersedia, herbisida 2,4D dikelompokkan sebagai ‘Kemungkinan Kecil bersifat Karsinogenik pada Manusia’”.
Dalam kajian yang dimulai di tahun 1970, JMPR selalu menyimpulkan apabila 2,4D digunakan dengan tepat, maka tidak akan menimbulkan ancaman kesehatan terhadap orang ataupun benda di tanah atau perairan.
Heroes Cross Swords in Sri Lanka
In his bitter resignation letter, the general accused Rajapaksa of “ unnecessarily placing Indian troops on high alert” and failing to “win the peace in spite of the fact that the army under my leadership won the war.”
In victory, that strength is being raised further, in the name of “eternal vigilance.”
But, with the fractured opposition rallying behind Fonseka and a moderate Tamil party also coming out in support of him, this election may produce a surprise result.
Alternatively, Israel might launch a pre-emptive war against Hezbollah in order to rob Iran of a nearby retaliatory capacity.
Although both Hezbollah and Iran still argue, perhaps correctly, that Israel will not give back the Golan Heights or allow the emergence of a Palestinian state, the possibility of peace cannot be ruled out.
While Hezbollah has tried to convince other Lebanese that its presence helps maintain the country’s security and stability, regional and international developments suggest that it faces mounting challenges.
Tantangan-tantangan ini, meskipun sulit untuk diatasi, setidaknya dapat dilihat.
Selama booming infrastruktur domestiknya, Tiongkok mendanai proyek-proyek besar – umumnya berhubungan dengan pertambangan, energi, dan infrastruktur – di negara berkembang lainnya.
Perjanjian currency-swap, yang penting bagi Brasil dan Argentina, juga perlu diperhitungkan.
Those opposed to such rampant use of drugs note that diagnostic rates for bipolar disorder, in particular, have skyrocketed by 4,000% and that overmedication is impossible without over-diagnosis.
DSM-III grew out of meetings that many participants described as chaotic.
Yet the complete story turned out to be rather more complicated.
Failure to reform psychiatry will be disastrous for public health.
Domestic supply disruptions are now fueling inflation and compounding the problems of a subsidy-laden national budget.
Their responses, however, have fallen short, following a familiar sequence that begins with waiting for an endogenous bounce and aspiring to self-reliance.
And many of those who bravely fought for freedom had little political experience, placing an even greater premium on great leadership to channel Egyptians’ enormous energy – and their demands for greater social justice – into a shared vision and common purpose.
That is the bad news.
Without determined efforts at political progress and unity, however, it will remain stuck in neutral – and could slip into reverse.
But the fact that several Asian and emerging-market countries are resisting this decline by buying dollars is putting inordinate pressures on the more flexible currencies, such as the euro and the Canadian dollar, which are trading at record levels.
The Federal Reserve would be forced to lower interest rates further, making the dollar even less attractive, and the concomitant shift in global demand away from the US, marked by a sharp decline in the US trade balance, would put still more pressure on the dollar. According to my own calculations in a series of research papers with Maurice Obstfeld, the trade-weighted dollar would likely fall by 20% if a global demand shift (say, due to a US housing recession) were to cut the US trade deficit in half.
For the past couple of years, finance ministers and central bank heads have had the luxury of using the IMF meetings to congratulate themselves on rapid global growth, regardless of how much they actually contributed to it.
Iran’s nuclear program is the decisive factor in this equation, for it threatens irreversibly the region’s strategic balance.
Bush had promised to bring the Middle East conflict closer to a resolution before the end of his term this year.
·    With the approaching end of the Bush presidency and uncertainty about his successor’s policy, the window of opportunity for Israeli action is seen as potentially closing.
Should this newest attempt fail, things will soon get serious. Deadly serious.
With budget deficits that are projected to be 5% of GDP by the end of the coming decade, and a debt/GDP ratio that has roughly doubled in the past five years and is continuing to grow, the real interest rate on Treasuries should be significantly higher than it was in the past.
In other words, buyers are getting an additional 2% current yield in exchange for assuming the risk of holding long-term bonds.
The Fed has pursued its strategy of low long-term interest rates in the hope of stimulating economic activity.
What she brings to this task is openness and an eagerness to construct a new architecture for Sino-US relations.
This caution is understandable. But what seemed to be missing in China was a full recognition of just how uncertain things have become in the US, and how, with a new president, almost everything is in an unprecedented state of flux.
China should take up Clinton’s call for collaboration on climate change, which could possibly become a paradigm-shifting issue in Sino-US relations, much as the united front against the Soviet Union did in 1972, when Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger went to China to begin normalizing relations.
Sometimes her expression is briefly clouded by a streak of stifled pain, obstinate and not wholly contained.
It is ten in the evening, and I am waiting at the elevators in the lobby of the Hotel Westin with Mahmoud Jibril, one of the leaders of the Libyan insurrection.
She displays emotion and composure, I note.
And she has no doubt that the West, in responding to the Arab League’s entreaty to intervene, avoided a replay of Srebrenica in North Africa.
TOKYO – F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said that “there are no second acts in American lives.”
In the midst of two wars and Asia’s rise, Clinton confronted the three great tasks that any US secretary of state must face: pinpointing the challenges at hand; developing a viable strategy that attracts the support of the entire US government and public opinion; and managing the actual practice of US diplomacy.
Of course, Clinton’s efforts to revitalize America’s alliances made restoring confidence in US leadership an overriding priority, which she achieved without seeking to militarize every international problem.
Hillary in Asia, Round Two
As for Myanmar, its neighbors and fellow ASEAN members – Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand – are also concerned about Suu Kyi’s continued prosecution.
So diplomatic efforts must instead aim to join Americans and like-minded Asians in common cause, to push for steps forward in the medium to longer term.
There is still no confirmation concerning when Obama will visit Asia, though many expect that he will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit, to be held in Singapore in November.
Hillary\u0027s Back
(The real news in his victory was that he got a chunk of white men, who rarely support a Democrat.)
But one of her undeniable accomplishments, perhaps more important than anything else she did during that time, was the set of global journeys that she undertook on behalf of women’s issues.
Rather, cooperating with other international leaders, America tries to solve the world’s true problems: environmental degradation, resource shortages, inadequate literacy, and the appalling poverty in which the “bottom billion” live.
Clinton’s tour produced the clearest signals yet that America is unwilling to accept China’s push for regional hegemony.
And this was followed by the visit of a US aircraft carrier to Vietnam, the first since the Vietnam War ended 35 years ago.
In Asia, the hope today is that Clinton’s visit will enable China’s rulers to understand that it is primarily in Asia that their country’s overall international role is being tested and shaped.
The attendees would be wise to consider an important fact: Although the NPT requires its members to “pursue negotiations in good faith” on nuclear disarmament, a wide legal gap still remains when it comes to eliminating nuclear weapons.
And it is scandalous that vast sums are being devoted to maintaining and modernizing these weapons at a time when budget constraints undermine efforts to address pressing human needs around the world.
Until now, nuclear-weapon states’ national governments and bureaucracies have preferred to limit the disarmament debate to symbolic measures that imply no deadlines or additional legally binding obligations.
Egyptians go to the polls on September 7th to elect a president from among ten contenders, including the incumbent of 24 years, Hosni Mubarak.
So the Mubarak regime has had to use various ploys to neutralize the judge’s union.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood, thought to be the single strongest opposition group in Egypt, are urging their followers to caste ballots and vote their conscience but not to give support to any ‘despotic, corrupt rulers.’
One draws an analogy with Pearl Harbor, Japan’s attack on the US in 1941.
Vietnam proved to be the end not the beginning of the line.
They do not necessarily share the same aims as Al Qaeda.    
Leave Afghanistan to the Taliban, hoping against hope that they will become better-behaved global citizens, and what is the effect likely to be on Pakistan? Here come the dominoes – wrong in Vietnam but not necessarily in the South Asian sub-continent.
So the West should see the job through in Afghanistan – do it better but do it.  Sometimes the dominoes do topple over, one by one.
The banks’ institutional personalities reflect the role of collective memory in shaping how officials conceptualize the problems that they face.
They invoke specific analogies not so much because they resemble current conditions, but because they are seared into the public’s consciousness.
Anyone who does so will find it hard to defend the ECB and its stubborn inaction in the face of events.
That was the defining episode for American monetary policy. And I am, after all, an American.
Let us start with the analogy between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hitler.
The second analogy, to the old balance-of-power system in Europe, is especially popular among Israeli and American diplomats.
The third analogy is reflected in Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s recent references to Israel’s nuclear deterrent, which may have been a mistake, but probably indicate the evolution of Israeli strategic thinking.
The last two Secular Forums projected that, after the global financial crisis, the world economy would not reset in its traditional, cyclical manner.
Yet, along with “good” asset-price inflation, aimed at making people feel richer and spend more, these approaches have delivered “bad” inflation, owing to surging commodity prices, which impose a tax on both inputs and consumers.
As a result, many long-standing promises will come under pressure over the next 3-5 years.
·          Sovereign creditworthiness will continue to diverge, with a further deterioration in advanced countries and continued improvement in emerging markets.
Multi-year re-alignments are messy and complex, especially when they occur simultaneously at the national and global levels, and when multi-speed growth, inflation, and credit dynamics are at work, as is the case today.
The first thing that many people ask about charities is, “How much of my donation is spent on administration?” In the United States, that figure is readily available from Charity Navigator, a Web site that has five million users.
So Karnofsky and Hassenfeld got together with six friends who also worked in finance and divided up the field to find out which charities could be shown to be effective. They contacted organizations and received lots of attractive marketing material, but nothing that answered basic questions: what do the charities do with their money, and what evidence do they have that their activities help?
Population Services International, which promotes and sells items like condoms, to prevent HIV infection, and bed nets, to prevent malaria, came out on top, followed by Partners in Health, an organization that provides health care to poor rural populations.
In the US, individual donors give about $200 billion to charities each year.
There are many who acknowledge this and want to change.
In today's Netherlands, assertiveness is seen as a good thing, modesty as a form of self-chastisement.
Indeed, what is most ominous is that extremists realize this more clearly than the moderate, silent majority, who find the noise irritating but do not know how to start a serious dialogue.
At the same time, native Europeans must learn to accept that Islam may offer new vantage points on such moral issues as euthanasia, abortion, individuality, and solidarity.
Children must learn that they do not live in a monoculture, but in a pluralist society bound together by universal values and common laws.
Indeed, the country could be facing catastrophe, as Hollande’s actions risk miring the economy into sustained stagnation and driving an increasingly angry French public to elect the far-right National Front party’s Marine Le Pen as his successor.
In the meantime, however, there will be an increase in diesel excise duties, and a 20% surcharge on property taxes will be imposed on unoccupied second homes in densely populated areas.
The deflationary impact of internal devaluation is compounded by the rule, reinforced in the 2012 “fiscal compact,” that eurozone countries are wholly responsible for their own debts and thus must adopt strict budgetary discipline.
As a result, France can expect popular protest, as well as a further increase in support for more extreme parties – above all, Le Pen’s National Front.
But corporate villains, typically multinational companies, have never been so ubiquitous as today.
Many policymakers seem to be under the impression that surging profits are a purely cyclical phenomenon, as economies continue to grow out from the depths of the 2001 recession.
Growing inequality would not be such a problem if governments could simply raise taxes on the rich and strengthen subsidies to the poor.
Otherwise, globalization’s storyline may not proceed according to the script.
The point of Holocaust denial is to remove the taboo now associated with the original crime.
Had she been politically active during the Nazi times, Merkel would have landed in a concentration camp.
What he doesn’t understand is that the memory of Auschwitz is also the memory of the Battle of Britain, the bombing of Dresden, the occupation of Paris, and the Warsaw uprising.
NEW YORK – In his remarkable apology to the Catholics of Ireland (most of that country’s population), Pope Benedict XVI explained why he thought sinful priests were tempted to commit sexual acts with children.
Such practices were accepted as facts of life, as they still are in many poor and southern countries, which might explain why the exposure of priestly abuse has taken place mostly in the north, where social change has been more rapid.
The real changes, in such countries as Ireland, Germany, or the US, concerned the status of women and children.
Catholics have tended to be more tolerant of hypocrisy than Protestants.
There is a solution to this problem.
They never seemed so much on people’s minds.
Europeans are buying gemütliche Alpine ski chalets, glamorous condominiums with Mediterranean views in the South of Spain, and, increasingly, villas in picturesque sites in Turkey, Hungary, and Croatia.
There is reason to worry about this.
Most vacationers seem to derive a sense of excitement from the presence of many other vacationers around them.
Uprooted from their homes and livelihoods, and traumatized by the violence or sudden disaster that forced them to flee, the displaced are often thrust into an extremely precarious future with few resources.
The number of those displaced by natural disasters is rising, as the adverse effects of climate change continue to mount.
We must prevent displacement from occurring, and end it as quickly as possible.
Ten years after the Guiding Principles were signed, the time for excuses and inaction has run out.
But the report plainly understated the degree of public support for change.
This could be accompanied by a pledge to create a legislature composed entirely of directly elected members in 2020.
Both sides will need to give a little to prevent the confrontation in the streets from escalating, with the police forced to provide a substitute for a sensible policy.
हांगकांग के फूहड़ प्राधिकारियों के लिए आगे के किसी रास्ते को सुझाने से पहले, तीन बातें स्पष्ट करना बहुत ज़रूरी है। सबसे पहले, हांगकांग के नागरिकों की निष्ठा और उनके सिद्धांतों पर यह एक मिथ्या आरोप लगाया जा रहा है कि बाहरी बलों द्वारा उनके साथ चालाकी की जा रही है जैसा कि चीनी सरकार का प्रचार तंत्र कर रहा है। हांगकांग के हजारों लाखों प्रदर्शनकारियों को जो चीज़ प्रेरित करती है वह उनका यह प्रबल विश्वास है कि स्वतंत्र और निष्पक्ष चुनाव में वे उन लोगों को चुन सकेंगे जो उन पर शासन करेंगे, उन्हें अपने मामलों को चलाने दिया जाना चाहिए, जैसा कि उनसे वादा किया गया था।


In April 2004, China's legislators ruled out universal suffrage in Hong Kong's 2007 election of its chief executive, as well as for its 2008 Legislative Council election.
Indeed, at the close of nomination on August 4, eleven functional candidates were chosen without opposition, including those representing banks and the Chinese chamber of commerce.
It only backed down when the pro-government Liberal Party, which held a number of functional seats, broke ranks as a result of intense public pressure.
Hong Kong's people may well conclude that they have no alternative but to use every occasion to protest chief executive Tung Chee-hwa's unpopular government, making it even harder for him to govern.
Indeed, the deal that Hong Kong’s colonial subjects appeared to accept – leaving politics alone in exchange for the opportunity to pursue material prosperity in a safe and orderly environment – is not so different from the deal accepted by China’s educated classes today.
They recognized then that under future Chinese rule, only genuine democracy might safeguard the institutions that protected Hong Kong’s freedoms.
China traditionally had institutions – clan associations, religious communities, business groups, and so on – that were relatively autonomous.
So far, there is no evidence that the protesters in Hong Kong’s Central district have any ambition to undermine, let alone topple, the government in Beijing.
HONG KONG – The massive public demonstrations by students and young members of the middle-class that have roiled Hong Kong in recent weeks are ostensibly demands for democracy.
The Western-educated heir to a shipping fortune, and unusually well connected with the global elite, Tung was thought to be a conservative, thoughtful, cosmopolitan man imbued with liberal values and free of ties to the powerful families that dominated the real-estate industry in the territory.
Tung’s successor, Donald Tsang, was chosen reluctantly.
Worse, Leung pushed forward an unpopular plan to introduce “patriotic education” to Hong Kong, stoking fear among students of a China-dictated brainwashing.
BERKELEY – However bad you think the global economy is today in terms of the business cycle, that is only one lens through which to view the world.
Overwhelmingly, those who became and remained unemployed suffered the most.
But, after six months or so passed without successful reemployment, they tended to become discouraged and distraught.
Horse Trading and Climate Change
At least the panda smiled.
“Copenhagen 1” was always bound to fail, partly because – and this may sound strange at first – it is all about climate change.
For, as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has explicitly warned, if emissions do not fall before 2015, and only fall from then onwards (and the overall trend is that they have been rising), we will reach the point of no return.
The inherently erratic behavior of the major renewable energy technologies presents serious problems for power system planners.
Six thousand kilometers below the surface, the planet’s core is as hot as the surface of the sun.
But it is the economics of HDR geothermal that will eventually determine its long-term role, because deep boreholes are expensive to drill, and their costs must be met before power stations can begin to generate electricity. The shallower the heat resources and the cheaper the capital, the more competitive an HDR project will be.
Over the past six months, attention and worry have shifted from America’s enormous trade deficit to its surging property markets and real-estate bubble.
But we aren’t willing to do that.
As the prices of these assets fall, their yields will rise.
If there is a sharp spike in interest rates – caused either by capital flight in anticipation of a dollar decline or by tight monetary policy in reaction to a dollar decline comes to pass – we will see how good the Federal Reserve really is.
They also track their workouts, monitor their babies, and amass huge collections of digital friends (for better or worse).
Like computers and the Internet, 3D printing will affect business and behavior around the world and across industries.
One early example is KeyMe.net, which makes house keys on demand.
Consider Apple power cords (the item that I lose most often), which are a huge source of profit for all involved.
In the long run, 3D printing will allow more efficient use of physical resources and faster diffusion of the best designs, boosting living standards around the world.
The basic idea was to solicit thousands of predictions from hundreds of experts about the fates of dozens of countries, and then score the predictions for accuracy.
We can see this process in sharp relief when, following the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, we classify experts as “hedgehogs” or “foxes.”
Because they avoid over-simplification, foxes make fewer mistakes.
Granted, it is not easy to create methods of keeping score that are credible across the spectrum of reasonable opinion.
Europeans might rethink some of their current dilemmas in the light of Hirschman’s theory.
As a result, the EU is constantly expanding, while the US likes to urge the world to democratize.
In the mid-1980’s, then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher successfully pushed the idea of an integrated internal market.
It is easier for the US to deal with Europe as a whole, especially when some European answers to common social dilemmas look as if they might provide solutions for America as well.
DENVER – Critics of America’s Middle East policies are reminiscent of Woody Allen’s quip in Annie Hall: “The food at this place is really terrible...and such small portions.”
Unilateralism, it seems, is fast becoming the isolationists’ internationalism.
The Kremlin’s consequential and sustained support of Assad is serious policy, and suggests that if the US is to make progress short of confrontation with Russia, it should work with Russian leaders to narrow the differences so that, at the end of the process, a peace conference is held.
Obama’s explanation of a Syrian policy might look something like this: “Syria is a difficult problem that, left unchecked, could threaten US interests in the region.
In the end, a solution in Syria will depend on Syrians’ agreement on future political arrangements.
Are they right?
And yet legal change was not central in Brazil’s success.
Commercial arbitration – and courts’ obligations to enforce the arbitrators’ decisions – can assure investors, even if the courts generally do not.
How, then, did his victory help to fuel the financial growth of the subsequent decade?
Institutional improvements help, but they can come later.
In only two decades, China has become Southeast Asian countries’ leading economic partner, boosting its influence throughout the region.
Though China remains well behind Japan, Europe, and the US on this front, it certainly has the potential to catch up, as Chinese private-equity firms increasingly look abroad.
The US, meanwhile, is struggling to cobble together a domestic consensus on trade.
And, on a broader, institutional scale, the money spent and the money to be gained do not belong to the same pocket.
(There are also all the separate costs of bad health, which are much harder to count or capture.)
But I think it is doable – especially if they work together to figure out the numbers, study the effects of small-scale healthy-living/preventive health-care efforts, and encourage one another to move forward.
They will choose themselves.
Five years from now, we will wonder what took us so long to get started.
Specifically, what happens to entrepreneurs once they get their money? Everywhere I go – and I have been in Moscow, Libreville (Gabon), and Dublin in the last few weeks – smart people ask how to get companies through the next phase of growth.
But this week in Dublin, I found what we need: not policies or theories, but actual living examples.
These guys are not the “startups”; they are the mentors, carefully solicited by Kelly from within the tightly knit Irish business community.
Not all of them have the makings of an entrepreneur. But most of them have skills worth sharing, whether it’s how to run a sales meeting, oversee a development project, or manage a database of customers.
For example, some oil-producing countries ask their customers to pay in euros, but that does not mean that their oil is priced in euros.
As the dollar declines, commodities – including oil – attract investors.
If nominal oil prices remain constant while the dollar declines, the real income of the oil-producing countries declines, resulting in less investment in additional capacity and maintenance.
But, since many Americans use gas-guzzling SUV’s for their vacations, demand for gasoline has remained high.
The most interesting analogies are Germany’s rise in the 19th century and Japan’s in the 20th.
In both the German and the Japanese cases, the already-existing industrial powers complained that there was some sort of nefarious and unfair mechanism behind the newcomer’s advantages.
Like Germany in the mid-19th century, or Japan in the 1960’s, China sees many advantages in participating in the international order more or less as it is currently configured.
If China is to avoid the fate of early 20th century Germany, it must bolster successful economic modernization with constitutional and political reform.
Development economists, for their part, argued that much more attention would be paid to randomized trials and field experiments.
As this view is sometimes put, the next 20 years will see no breakthrough as revolutionary as the steam engine or the transistor.
Knowledge, as encapsulated in the textbook and interpreted by the professor, is delivered from above.
The outcome will be messy. But the economics profession will also become more diverse and dynamic – and our children’s economics will be healthier as a result.
Thus was born the field of rational-choice political economy, and a style of theorizing that many political scientists readily emulated.
The more we claimed to be explaining, the less room was left for improving matters.
There would then scarcely be any need for engineering schools.
Revenue hungry governments will impose a lower tax when they think that it can be evaded than when they think that it cannot.
Without a clear understanding of who gains and who loses from the status quo, it is difficult to make sense of our existing policies.
Flexibility allows NGOs to be innovative in ways that organizations like the UN often cannot.
The situation in Indonesia led the UN to adopt a new “cluster” system to improve coordination.
CARE, as both a relief and development agency, can take a long-term approach to disasters, matching emergency relief with a rehabilitation and recovery phase.
The HPG therefore recommended long-term monitoring of future humanitarian responses, and said that success or failure should be judged in a broad context rather than by a narrow focus on a specific project.
Of course, the Muslim Brotherhood was also a victim of its own mistakes, particularly the failure of Morsi and his government to reach out to the secular opposition, elements of which had contributed to his election.
Morsi and the Brotherhood also faced competition from Saudi-backed Salafists.
Immediately following the coup, the European Union adopted an ambivalent position toward it.
Hope remains that Egypt will not become Algeria in 1992 (or Chile in 1973).
German Chancellor Angela Merkel resisted all proposals to provide relief to Spain and Italy from the excessive risk premiums that both countries are now confronting.
In exchange for specified structural reforms in Italy and Spain, the Fund would acquire and hold a significant portion of their outstanding stock of debt.
Of course, the issuance of European Treasury bills would require the approval of the Bundestag, but it would be in conformity with the German Constitutional Court’s requirement that any commitment approved by the Bundestag be limited in time and size.
If the rest of Europe is united behind this proposal, and the Bundestag rejects it, Germany must take full responsibility for the financial and political consequences.
Indeed, these factors help to explain why France remains the world’s fifth-largest economy.
The “law on growth and activity” that will be voted on this year will unleash the business sector’s energy, including by stimulating competition.
French citizens will soon begin to feel the impact of these efforts in their daily lives.
But my government will not be deterred from forward-thinking action that will ensure that tomorrow’s France is the France our citizens want and deserve.
How Free is Speech?
He has compared the Koran to Hitler’s Mein Kampf , and wishes to stop immigration of Muslims to the Netherlands.
He should be criticized, even ridiculed, but not jailed.
Words used by young black men among themselves in American cities would have a very different resonance if young white men used them.
And that not only makes it harder to attack their views, but also gives free speech a bad name. 
Indeed, they are cleared to leave, and it is only Obama’s failure to keep his promise – and the US Congress’s failure to legislate their transfer – that is keeping them there.
I recently toured Alcatraz, the former US federal prison in San Francisco Bay.
They are not even notified of the deaths of parents and children.
Perhaps, someday, tourists will travel to Guantánamo and look in horror and amazement at what America built.
But India’s resilience in the face of adversity, and its mature restraint in the face of violent provocation, encouraged investors to return.
Among the drivers of growth, domestic capital formation retained much of its momentum from preceding years.
Some 40% of the population still lives below a poverty line drawn just this side of the funeral pyre.
CHICAGO – Before the recent financial crisis, politicians on both sides of the aisle in the United States egged on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-backed mortgage agencies, to support low-income lending in their constituencies.
Moreover, any change will require years to take effect, and therefore will not address the electorate’s current anxiety.
In the US, though, there have been strong political forces arrayed against direct redistribution in recent years.
In fact, one does not even need to look outside the US for examples.
As global financial uncertainty rises, it is time for Japan to change course.
In the US, this has complicated the Federal Reserve’s task.
Current ultra-low interest rates may be scaring people about the adequacy of future income.
Global investors are apparently willing to accept these extraordinarily low rates, even though they do not appear to compensate for expected inflation.
Finally, oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates seek to set aside wealth during the boom years.
But how long can the storm last? Although highly unpredictable, it is easy to imagine how the process could be reversed.
Third, eventually the clouds over Europe will be resolved, though I admit that this does not seem likely to happen anytime soon.
If a shooting war ever breaks out in Asia, Japan is nowadays prepared to do a lot more than fill the petrol tanks.
Nor are the Self-Defense Forces' operations and obligations any longer restricted to Japanese territory and the adjacent seas.
Every Japanese citizen may have his or her own opinion, but a clear majority appear to agree that Japan must become a prominent nation in promoting international and regional security, as well as economic growth.
But America, in its global war on terror, has justifiably lost interest in bearing Asia's many military burdens alone.
Human beings would be more like the “lilies of the field, who toil not, neither do they spin.”
The reason we have done so well is that annual productivity growth has been higher than Keynes projected: about 1.6% for the UK, and a bit higher for the US.
He recognized that there are two kinds of needs, absolute and relative, and that the latter may be insatiable.
But, since most of the rich – “those who have an independent income but no associations or duties or ties” have “failed disastrously” to live the “good life,” why should those who are currently poor do any better?
The financial-reform law passed by the United States Congress last month requires improved transparency from banks and other financial-services firms.
It also published a list of Web sites that the Australian government proposed blocking, the extreme-right British National Party’s membership roll, an analysis of a major Icelandic bank’s default risk, and video footage of a US helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed 12 people, including a Reuters journalist and photographer.
But even some supporters of open government think Wikileaks goes too far.
Sometimes it is possible to do good only in secret.


Egypt is entering a new era. But the radical policy upheavals predicted by analysts will prove to be small tremors. Saudi interests will continue to weigh heavily on Egyptian foreign policy.
That is how regulatory progress is often made.
The label would be designed for those who are less motivated and/or able to read these prospectuses.
Including such statements in the disclosure is analogous to the requirement that food labels contain a full list of nutritional factors per serving, rather than merely a featured list that the producer might try to add in order to promote the product.
The choice of words to describe America’s fiscal situation matters, given the hysteria that has been whipped up in recent months, primarily by people who want to make big cuts in the country’s two main entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare.
These tax cuts should also be linked to the state of the economy, so that they would wind down as employment recovers (for example, to its level in 2007, relative to total population).
Ordinarily, partisan political gridlock in Washington would prevent any such sensible change.
During his campaign, Obama demonstrated these skills in his calm response to crises, his forward-looking vision, and his superb organizational ability.
We judge leaders not only by the effectiveness of their actions, but also by the meanings that they create and teach. 
Contextual intelligence is the intuitive diagnostic skill that helps a leader align tactics with objectives to produce smart strategies in different situations.
On the bottom board of transnational relations outside the control of governments – pandemics, climate change, the drug trade, or transnational terrorism, for example – power is chaotically distributed.
The Alberta government – and the oil companies that influence it – would upgrade “tar sands” to “oil sands,” apparently thinking that a better name somehow silences environmental critics.
Had BP spilled hundreds of billions of barrels of bitumen across hundreds of square kilometers, environmentalists would rightly demand that no expense be spared to rid the dirt of every trace of oil.
They disparage hideous strip mines and toxic tailing ponds that even superstar marketers cannot “greenwash.” &#160;The scale is unusual, but open-pit mines and tailing ponds are normal mining operations everywhere.
These developments will come anyway, and, once they do, the United States will become a mere bystander.
In the longer term, were shale gas and oil to satisfy US demand, Canadian oil could wean America’s allies from their Middle East oil addiction, giving them new foreign-policy options, too.
The Political Economy of 2013
The question, both for Italy and Europe as a whole, is whether the new government will maintain the current economic policy stance or shift to one that is less acceptable to the country’s external partners (particularly Germany and the European Central Bank).
In other countries, the causal direction will run primarily from economics to politics.
While some would have favored greater policy activism, Merkel’s Germany has provided a steady anchor for a eurozone struggling to end bouts of financial instability and put an end to questions about its survival as a well-functioning monetary union (one that aspires to becoming much more).
BRUSSELS/MEXICO CITY – Since the global economic downturn began in 2008, debate has centered on the macroeconomic strategies and instruments used to address the crisis and foster recovery.
The renowned American economist Mancur Olson argued that stagnation in developed economies results from cartels and lobbies becoming more numerous and powerful over time, until they eventually drain a country’s economic dynamism.
Economic policy is like gardening: pulling on plants will not make them grow faster, but a successful gardener can provide them with the right environment in which to flourish.
This cannot be achieved without bridging ideological divisions and overcoming political pressures from particular economic groups.
By basing economic policy on this experience, we could not only avert Olson’s grim prophecy. We could also accelerate economic recovery, increase the pace of innovation, and raise livelihoods for millions of people worldwide.
These inferior substitutes often imply exorbitant costs for borrowers – and financing that is usually too short term for productive investment activity.
In Malaysia, agent-banking regulation (which safeguards consumers’ interests while supporting financial institutions’ business models) has led to the expansion of branchless banking to reach previously unserved rural areas.
This September, Malaysia’s central bank will advance the process by hosting AFI’s Global Policy Forum.
With its benchmark lending rate at the zero-bound, the Fed has embraced a fundamentally different approach in attempting to guide the US economy.
After all, it conducts a comprehensive triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which provides a detailed assessment of the role that wealth and balance sheets play in shaping the behavior of a broad cross-section of American consumers.
Trapped in the aftermath of a wrenching balance-sheet recession, US families remain fixated on deleveraging – paying down debt and rebuilding their income-based saving balances.
The Occupy Wall Street movement began two years ago this month.
NEWPORT BEACH – Three years after the global financial crisis, the global economy remains a confusing place – and for good reasons.
While the obstacles are not yet sufficiently serious to derail the ongoing recovery, only a fool would gloss over them.
Last week, Portugal joined Greece and Ireland in seeking an official bailout to avoid a default that would undermine Europe’s banking system.
The longer the US postpones the day of reckoning, the greater the risk to the dollar’s global standing as the world’s main reserve currency, and to the attractiveness of US government bonds as the true “risk-free” financial benchmark.
There has not been a good solution since that black Wednesday in August 2013, when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s war machine, by using chemical weapons, crossed the “red line” that US President Barack Obama had warned would trigger an American military response.
The world was rightly horrified by America’s recent blunder in bombing the Médecins Sans Frontières’ hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan.
And his thinly veiled threats against the Baltic states, Poland, Finland, and now Turkey – whose airspace and relations with NATO have been probed by Russian aircraft – reveal a strategy of aggression that has as its chief goal the weakening of Europe.
Will the enormous rise of United States government debt that is projected for the coming decade and beyond lead to inflation or even to default? Will the explosive growth of commercial banks’ excess reserves cause rapid inflation as the economy recovers?
While it is hard to say how much the decline might be, it would not be surprising to see a fall of 20% over the next several years from the current level of about 1.4 dollars per euro.
It will also use its new authority to pay interest on the reserves held by commercial banks at the Fed in order to prevent excessive lending.
Described as a “generational opportunity,” the potential is indeed great.
Unfortunately, the proposed health agenda seems to ignore this trend.
Of the 99 papers reviewed for the health consultation, 15 came from organizations promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights, while only five were from NCD-focused groups (six if a paper from a group supported by the alcohol industry is included).
For example, people living with and affected by HIV organized vibrant social movements that issued demands for change at national and global levels, dismantled legal and social barriers that exacerbated risk, and articulated norms and standards in human-rights terms.
Likewise, over the last four decades, improved breeding methods, higher-quality feed, and better veterinary care have more than doubled average milk production worldwide. Nevertheless, regional discrepancies remain massive: cows in the Netherlands can produce roughly 9,000 liters of milk annually, while Zebu cattle in the tropics produce only about 300 liters.
Underused land reserves also exist elsewhere in South America, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe.
Whether climate change will be a source of yield uncertainty in the coming decades remains unclear as well.
But it would not have changed the course of history for the worse if President Bush had not responded as he did.
Indeed, since September 2001, the war on terror has claimed more innocent victims than those terrorist attacks.
Nevertheless, the ideologues in the administration were determined to pursue it because, in the words of Paul Wolfowitz, "it was doable."
Indeed, after all that has happened, a majority of the US electorate continues to have confidence in Bush on national security matters.
The war on terror polarizes the world.
If Americans fail to recognize that they may be wrong, they risk undermining the country's dominant position.
After the long and painful campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, I understand every impulse to stay clear of the turmoil, to watch but not to intervene, to ratchet up language but not to engage in the hard, even harsh business of changing reality on the ground.
I completely understand this view. But to embrace it would be a grave strategic error.
If you elect a bad government, then tough – you live with it.
The people do want democracy, but they will be disdainful of Western critics whom they will see as utterly naive in the face of the threat to democracy that the Muslim Brotherhood posed.
But others are taking sides.
I understand why the pendulum has swung so heavily the other way.
The West would have to pay tribute to China in the future the way it had kowtowed to it in the past.
There is more fear today in the West, but also a little less hope in Asia.
The question is no longer one of shared interests or common security goals, but of culture, as the United States, in particular, increasingly looks to Asia and Latin America and attracts immigrants from those regions.
How to Avoid a Double-Dip Global Recession
Overspending countries are now retrenching, owing to the need to reduce their private and public spending, to import less, and to reduce their external deficits and deleverage.
Seventh, in countries where private and public debt levels are unsustainable – household debt in countries where the housing boom has gone bust and debts of governments, like Greece’s, that suffer from insolvency rather than just illiquidity – liabilities should be restructured and reduced to prevent a severe debt deflation and contraction of spending.
But how can we distinguish good banks from bad?
As a result, Japan never fully recovered from its recession.
As Simon Johnson suggests in his book 13 Bankers, we should break up the mega-banks into smaller parts that can comfortably be allowed to fail.
Although this plan would prop up the value of the financial system as a whole, it would still allow market forces to determine relative share prices of individual banks.
How to Default on Sovereign Debt
More likely than not, sovereign debtors will have to interact with the same creditors and international actors again.
And yet things are not necessarily so black and white.
This repayment contributed to a slow improvement in its credit rating and its eventual return to international capital markets in 2014.
If the real interest rate on Greek debt were 4% (more or less what Greece is paying now for the emergency loans from the European Union) and annual GDP grew by 2% on average, the required primary fiscal surplus each year for the next quarter-century would be 5.7% of GDP.
This approach has several advantages: by leaving the face value of the debt unaltered, EU officials could argue that restructuring Greece’s debt did not amount to a default, thereby limiting contagion.
But markets are already assigning a high probability to a Greek default.
NEW YORK – Some people thought that Barack Obama’s election would turn everything around for America.
The total shortfalls were estimated at $150 billion a few months ago; now the number must be much larger – indeed, California alone faces a shortfall of $40 billion.
- Confidence is important, but it must rest on sound fundamentals.
- Don’t confuse saving bankers and shareholders with saving banks.
The era of believing that something can be created out of nothing should be over.
As I argue in my book The Globalization Paradox, expanding the scope for national governments to maintain regulatory diversity and rebuild frayed social bargains would enhance the functioning of the global economy.
Progress along such a path requires “national” citizens to begin viewing themselves increasingly as “global” citizens, with interests that extend beyond their state’s borders.
World Resources Institute President Andrew Steer notes that more than 50 developing countries are now implementing costly policies to reduce climate change.
Of course, “global citizenship” will always be a metaphor, because there will never be a world government administering a worldwide political community.
Discredited regimes may cling all the more ruthlessly and ruinously to power, as in Syria.
Burma has a very different internal political dynamic, not least because of the complex relationships among its various ethnic and linguistic communities – social cleavages that were not an issue in largely homogeneous Poland’s transition.
Above all, we should be patient.
We feel less lonely – it all worked out for you.”
After being pushed to the wall by more than two decades of Western expansion – be it European Union or NATO enlargement – into a part of Europe that it considers vital to its national security, Russians believe that they have the moral high ground in defending their interests.
One centers on the US and its ambition to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).
What matters in resolving today’s conflicts, be they active or supposedly “frozen,” is to build a broader framework of cooperation and dialogue between the EU and what I term Greater Eurasia.
Around the world, the number of women in the workforce remains far below that of men; only about half of working-age women are employed.
Employment of women on an equal basis with men provides companies with a larger talent pool, potentially increasing creativity, innovation, and productivity.
Women benefit when flexible work arrangements are introduced and the barriers between part-time and full-time work contracts are lowered, as the Netherlands has successfully done.
MELBOURNE – Did you make any New Year’s resolutions? Perhaps you resolved to get fit, to lose weight, to save more money, or to drink less alcohol.
But if we have already made that decision, why don’t we just do it? From Socrates onwards, that question has puzzled philosophers.
What does this have to do with keeping resolutions? Richard Holton, a professor of philosophy at MIT and the author of Willing, Wanting, Waiting, points out that a resolution is an attempt to overcome the problem of maintaining an intention when we expect that, at some future time, we will face inclinations contrary to our intention.
·         Break your resolution into a series of small steps;
BERKELEY – The dollar has had its ups and downs, but the downs have clearly dominated of late.
The dollar would plummet. There would be financial distress and a deep recession.
Indeed, the very fact that the Fed is under such intense political scrutiny makes it all but certain that it will take the first opportunity to reestablish its price-stability bona fides.
When banks borrow on the wholesale money market to finance their investments, they borrow in dollars.
Caught on the horns of this dilemma, the Fed could do nothing to solve America’s problems.
We need to assess what can be achieved at the national level and what EU institutions should do.
This must go hand in hand with a discussion of how the EU can provide incentives to member states that are committed to difficult structural reforms at a time of retrenchment, which could lead to talks about possible forms of fiscal coordination. Though it is premature to enter into such discussions now, the issue should not be taken off the table.
Most worrying, the crisis has challenged the very idea of European integration. Thus, we will be able to advance a reformist agenda only if we have a convincing narrative that explains why we need Europe and why it serves the interests of current and future generations.
LOS ANGELES – The recent stampede in Mecca, in which more than a thousand pilgrims making the hajj were trampled to death, is a tragic but powerful reminder of the city’s prominence in the Muslim world.
Annual influxes of hundreds of thousands of pilgrims closely packed into steamships were blamed for spreading cholera through port cities from Bombay to Hamburg, making the hajj a major cause of death around the world.
When the Saudi government introduced Fords to the area in around 1930, it needed all of its military resources to prevent the Bedouin from destroying them.
It is up to the rest of the Muslim world to provide alternatives to the modern idea, championed by Saudi Wahhabis and other arch-conservatives, that Mecca is the inexorable and inevitable center of the Muslim world.
More than a decade after the launch of the Doha Round of global free-trade talks, this agreement could be a down payment on the commitment that WTO members have made to linking trade and development.
A new customs component to a highway project between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City helped increase the total value of trade through the Moc Bai-Bavet border by 40% over three years.
It is time for WTO members to make progress on issues where there is room to do so.
Equity-based awards, coupled with the highly leveraged capital structure of banks, tie executives’ compensation to a leveraged bet on the value of banks’ assets. As Holger Spamann and I show in our research, executive payoffs should be tied to the long-term value delivered not only to shareholders, but also to other contributors to banks’ capital.
To do so, executive payoffs could be made dependent on changes in the value of the banks’ credit-default swaps, which reflect the probability that the bank will not have sufficient capital to meet its full obligations.
It thus would also contribute to making our financial systems safer.
As a result, levels of import penetration actually fell, quite sharply, in virtually every country.
In 1931, after Britain and some two dozen other countries suspended gold convertibility and allowed their currencies to depreciate, countries that stuck to the gold standard found themselves in a deflationary vice.
The same is true today.
Fortunately, the Chinese government has a ready solution to this problem: that’s right, it can let its currency appreciate.
The European Central Bank should reverse its mistaken decision to hike interest rates.
Fifth, debt burdens that cannot be eased by growth, savings, or inflation must be rendered sustainable through orderly debt restructuring, debt reduction, and conversion of debt into equity.
Leaving the common currency would, of course, threaten collateral damage for the exiting country and raise the risk of contagion for other weak eurozone members.
The risks ahead are not just of a mild double-dip recession, but of a severe contraction that could turn into Great Depression II, especially if the eurozone crisis becomes disorderly and leads to a global financial meltdown. Wrong-headed policies during the first Great Depression led to trade and currency wars, disorderly debt defaults, deflation, rising income and wealth inequality, poverty, desperation, and social and political instability that eventually led to the rise of authoritarian regimes and World War II.
Upholding the peace treaty with Israel would have the opposite effect, enabling Egypt to pursue its goals of consolidating the military’s authority at home and enhancing its influence throughout the Middle East.
Egypt’s newly democratic government would be more strictly accountable for fulfilling the treaty’s terms if it played an active role in establishing them. At the same time, the agreement would boost domestic support for Egypt’s government and enhance its regional standing.
They remain badly in need of protection from the threat of insolvency.
And that is now happening.
Some compromise will be necessary.
Given the high risk premiums currently prevailing in Europe, this percentage is too low to constitute a level playing field.
Much depends on how the Greek crisis plays out.
A bailout, then, would simply delay the inevitable at a huge cost to taxpayers.
How can that be?
The secret behind Sweden’s successful development, and hence people’s attitudes, is how the costs of change are distributed.
Social protection also has a broad, general nature.
Intense foreign competition and rapid technological change does not have to be a race to the bottom.
As ever, change upsets the cozy status quo and the interests that benefit from it.
All politics is local, and there is no local constituency for the global economy, so what triumphs often erodes global imbalances further.
Unfortunately, it is difficult for existing NGOs to take up the cause of popularizing global economic policy coordination.
A transparent and fair process of arriving at its policy recommendations, based primarily on convincing economic research and data analysis, will be essential.
The targets set by the MDGs basically amounted to a list of “things that would be good to achieve.”
And why these particular goals? Why aspire to improve access to information technology (the Internet, mobile phones) but not to basic energy?
Despite the MDGs’ breadth, one issue received the most attention by far over the past decade: global warming.
But if we do not explicitly choose between policies based on their effectiveness, often the decision is made for us by other factors, including which issue attracts the most media attention or has self-interested corporations and activists pushing for a specific investment.
But, instead of celebrating an agreement that has helped stabilize East Asia for a half-century, the treaty is now at serious risk, as much from indecision as from kneejerk anti-Americanism.
But the biggest problem with Hatoyama’s government is that the DPJ took power without a coherent national security policy.
Instead of dealing with these concrete threats to Japan, Hatoyama continues to act like an opposition politician by attacking the LDP and undermining one of the proudest achievements of LDP rule, the deep and trusting alliance with the US.
People are discovering that Hatoyama is incapable of making – and sticking with – a decision.
Indeed, what really makes a crisis profound is precisely the broad variety of differing diagnoses and different remedies.
Such rescues, in short, appear to help big companies with bad managers.
In today’s credit crunch, as in the Great Depression, central banks lend at practically zero interest rates.
It is in times of crisis that Utopian ideas about ways of guaranteeing human happiness flourish, often claiming some scientific basis.
Although this election was accompanied by far less violence than the previous presidential vote in 2007, the opposition candidate Raila Odinga’s second consecutive defeat has only re-enforced his supporters’ fears that they are once again being cheated out of power.
By some definitions, around one-quarter of the country’s 44 million people are in the middle class.
There are even instances in which two managers will contrive to hire each other’s relatives to evade nepotism charges.
By introducing and implementing fairness and transparency to public-sector recruitment, and ensuring that appointments are based on talent, not ethnic or family connections, Kenyans may become less fearful about their political leaders’ origins.
While some countries ­- say, Poland - strongly supported America's war effort, others tried to balance their support for the US with their "understanding" of the views of Germany and France.
Although the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia recently declared they wanted to keep the Visegrad grouping alive even after their countries' enter the EU, the future of Visegrad cooperation is uncertain.
The three Baltic states will most likely cooperate much more closely with the Scandinavian countries than with the other new members.
Their plight, symptomatic in many ways of the plight of women around the world, holds lessons for us all.
The second reason that a million US women have filed for bankruptcy is that legislation enacted in 2005 now pits individual women – who can’t afford costly legal advice – against credit-card companies in terms of who gets paid first when ex-husbands owe delinquent credit-card payments and child-support payments.
As a result, they often see buying trendy shoes or a great haircut – rather than giving some money each month to a broker – as an “investment” in their romantic futures.
When middle-class women anywhere in the world get over this taboo, we will do so by understanding that money is never just about money, and that becoming financially literate means pushing back against a social role that casts middle-class women as polite, economically vague, underpaid, shopping-dazed dependents.
For the moment, things are moving in the wrong direction.
But Japanese men, who spend less time caring for children than fathers in most other industrialized countries, could share more of the responsibilities of parenting.
More important, current tax policies that reinforce women’s over-representation in temporary contract work should be changed.
The latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), published by the consultancy Z/Yen in London, revealed that the Rock had risen further and faster up the ranks than any other center – 17 places, from 70th to 53rd position, since the previous report in September 2013.
For one brief shining moment, the Royal Bank of Scotland was global top dog in rankings of commercial banks, and we know how that story ended.
Indeed, it seems that London’s small decline is attributable to negative scores on general factors such as the “business environment” and “infrastructure.”
That is especially true in fund management.
But, unless New York’s populist new mayor, Bill de Blasio, tries to run the banks out of town, Western sheriff-style, these cities do not seem likely to steal Wall Street’s crown anytime soon.
The AQR is the key element in a “comprehensive assessment” of Europe’s banks before the ECB formally takes on supervisory responsibility for more than 80% of the eurozone banking system in November.
Collectively, they are known as the ESAs (European supervisory authorities).
Integration-minded officials at the European Commission clearly do not regard this as a satisfactory end-state.
The general direction is clear.
His forecast represented a simple extrapolation of two trends: continued financial deepening worldwide (that is, faster growth of financial assets than of the real economy), and London’s maintenance of its share of the global financial business.
Andy Haldane, one of the lieutenants Carney inherited at the BoE, has questioned the financial sector’s economic contribution, pointing to “its ability to both invigorate and incapacitate large parts of the non-financial economy.”
Using a sample of 20 developed countries, they find a negative correlation between the financial sector’s share of GDP and the health of the real economy.
Periods of rapid growth in lending are often associated with construction booms, partly because real-estate assets are relatively easy to post as collateral for loans.
JPMorgan will bounce back, of course, but its travails have reopened the debate about what to do with banks that are “too big to fail.”
Banks on the list must keep higher reserves, and maintain more liquidity, reflecting their status as systemically important institutions.
The UK has decided to take action before any Europe-wide solution is agreed.
Germany’s government seems to have little appetite for breaking up Deutsche Bank, and the French have taken a leaf from the British book and implemented their own reform.
That is not the outcome that the G-20 – or anyone else – sought back in 2009.
To be sure, the exchange rate has an impact on investment and trade.
Intellectual property protection is related to economic development, so the question should be whether China has reached the stage at which effective protection is possible.
Nevertheless, to American eyes, other contentious issues are now emerging in relations with China.
MEXICO CITY – Supporters of Hugo Chávez, the recently deceased Venezuelan president, and even many of his critics, have repeatedly emphasized two supposed achievements that will burnish his legacy.
The decline was especially pronounced in the three largest countries – Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina – which comprise nearly 75% of the region’s population.
With the exception of the Caracazo – a wave of protests against free-market reforms in 1989 that resulted in an estimated 3,000 deaths – there were only minor bouts of repression.
LONDON – I remember the exact date of my visit to Venezuela.
Oligarchs fight to keep control over the oil revenues, populists promise to redistribute them, and both groups steal as much as they can for themselves.
Upon reasserting political control in 2003, Chávez fired 40% of PDVSA’s staff.
In early 2013, the government was forced to announce a 32% devaluation, and stopped issuing government debt in dollars.
Chávez’s petro-diplomacy sometimes took bizarre forms, like providing cheap bus travel for Londoners to please London’s left-wing mayor, Ken Livingstone.
Indeed, there is an almost universal belief that, with multifaceted cultures and intricate technology, humans have freed themselves from the pressures of natural selection.
The most significant changes occur when individuals at one end of a trait’s value are heavily favored, pushing the entire population in that direction.
Recently developed statistical tools have finally made this possible. With more sophisticated methods, my colleagues and I were reliably able to distinguish genetic changes, and thus to demonstrate an evolutionary shift toward a younger age at first birth in a small, insular population in Québec over the last 140 years.
Add to that a faltering global economy, and there seems to be little “holiday cheer” on offer.
As a child, the mere sight of the dentist chair would cause me to break out in a cold sweat, as I anticipated my forthcoming encounter with the battery of gleaming instruments seemingly designed for the principal purpose of causing excruciating pain.
Louis XIV of France had all of his upper teeth removed after a dentist fractured his jaw trying to extract a lower molar.
Even if she did, however, she would not face the barriers that people with poor dental health confronted in the past.
Migration Realism
But, all too often, migrants are used as scapegoats.
European countries, for example, need to devise mechanisms to share the flow of incoming migrants.
We must be careful not to drive migration further underground or offer additional opportunities to the criminal gangs that prey on the desperation of migrants to make obscene profits.
Indeed, the discrimination usually continues even after they are cured, blighting not only their lives, but the lives of their family members.
Many of the problems faced by people affected by leprosy today stem from society’s ignorance about the disease.
We call on states to use the opportunity afforded by the UN’s historic resolution to work toward a world where people affected by leprosy and their family members can live with dignity and play their part in the life of the community.
Against this background, it was impossible to agree on a single, comprehensive human rights instrument giving holistic effect to the Declaration’s principles. And, unsurprisingly, it took almost two decades before UN member states simultaneously adopted two separate treaties – the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights – encompassing the two distinct baskets of rights. However, only the former treaty was endowed with a follow-up mechanism to monitor its implementation.
Yet the Declaration’s enlightened vision of individual freedom, social protection, economic opportunity and duty to community is still unfulfilled.
A key part of the answer lies in more effective systems of accountability, so that rights are recognized and laws enforced.
Nothing on this anniversary is more important than to urge our leaders to recognize the scale of the task and commit to sustained action to build institutional capacities to protect human rights, starting in their own countries.
Thanks to this collective effort, tens of thousands of individuals – and millions more through schools, community groups, trade unions, and civil society organizations – have come to identify again, or for the first time, with the goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The security impasse that exists between Israel and the Gazan-Palestinian leadership has also led to blockades of food aid by Israel that have left Gaza’s 1.5 million people facing conditions of real hunger.
This diversion of the energy of war can take place at any stage of the cycle of escalation, but if preventive peace building is not launched at the first sign of trouble, and problems remain unaddressed as the conflict intensifies (especially if it turns violent), some type of intervention will be needed.
Palestinians and Israelis need to establish viable dialogues across the huge social fissures that divide them, as well as dialogues between the authorities and ordinary people who live in a state of confusion about what is being done in their name.
WASHINGTON, DC: There is an old saying that goes, “If you have only a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”
Trade deficits reflect transactions between producers and buyers, and those transactions are the result of incentives and price signals.
Once again, China provides clear evidence of these patterns, with almost 60% of Chinese exports being produced by foreign corporations.
Countries that substitute government spending for market spending either generate inflationary budget deficits, or end up with excessively high tax rates that destroy incentives.
Ever since, the country could be held together only by an iron fist: Iraq’s history is replete with Shia, Kurdish, and even Christian Assyrian revolts, all put down in bloody fashion by the ruling Sunni minority.
Let’s be frank: Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia as it disintegrated in the early 1990’s.
This may be more conducive to peace than trying to impose on them a hated occupation or an equally hated Shia hegemony.
On one side are politicians like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, US President Barack Obama, former Israeli Welfare and Social Services Minister Isaac Herzog, and religious figures like Pope Francis. On the other are Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán, French nationalist politician Marine Le Pen, US Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, the Cardinal of Hungary, Péter Erdő, and legions of other Eastern European clergy.
Their gut-level response is to build fences and walls, as long and as tall as possible, whether on the border between Mexico and the US, on Israel’s border with Egypt, or on Hungary’s border with Serbia (or even with fellow EU member Croatia).
WASHINGTON, DC – When you spark one of the largest protests in Eastern Europe since the fall of communism, you know that you have stirred up the electorate. That is exactly what the Hungarian government did when it recently proposed an “Internet tax” of 50 euro cents ($0.62) per gigabyte.
The resulting price hikes impede the adoption and use of ICT, lowering tax revenues from purchases of goods and services. And the evidence shows an even larger indirect effect: restricting ICT adoption dampens growth.
Countries would be better off with policies that promote ICT: elimination of taxes and tariffs on ICT products and services, removal of non-tariff barriers like requiring local data storage, and encouragement of digital innovation and transformation in economic sectors through regulatory and procurement reform.
With the lowest central pressure of the 2012 hurricane season, Sandy may have caused up to $20 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest superstorms in history.
Indeed, recent reports by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other scientific literature suggest that the intensity of tropical cyclones (that is, hurricanes) will increase as a result of warmer waters.
It should also be noted that an atmospheric weather pattern known as a “block,” a persistent area of high pressure that may have led to record melting in Greenland, was most likely the reason that Sandy moved inland rather than out to sea.
The world will need more cooperation in the coming years, as climate change begins to interact with and exacerbate extreme weather events, in order to gain the lead-time needed to prepare for disasters.
Thirty years ago, Australian vessels, with the government’s blessing, killed sperm whales off the West Australian coast.
Moreover, whalers do not want to use a large amount of explosive, because that would blow the whale to pieces, while the whole point is to recover valuable oil or flesh.
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser’s conservative government accepted his recommendation that whaling be stopped, and Australia soon became an anti-whaling nation.
The Japanese do have one argument that is not so easily dismissed.
Stopping a Dirty Bomb
There is evidence that terrorist groups have tried to acquire the material needed to construct a crude nuclear explosive device, or a dirty bomb.
Although only a handful of these incidents involved material that could be used to make a nuclear explosive device, a relatively small amount of radioactive material could be combined with conventional explosives to create a dirty bomb.
Terrorists and criminals will try to exploit any vulnerability in the global security system.
Either way, the premise that the US should lead forcefully rests on the idea that without a benevolent hegemonic power to police the world, chaos will ensue and more malevolent forces will take over.
That is the paradox of imperialism.
Germany and Japan had to be kept down, the Communist powers had to be contained, and the old countries of Europe had to learn to live with one another under unifying pan-national institutions.
In his recent foreign-policy speech at the US Military Academy at West Point, Obama barely mentioned East Asia.
And it is just as natural for Japan to feel nervous about the prospect of becoming a kind of vassal state (the Koreans are more accustomed to this role, vis-à-vis China).
Under the Japanese name of Takagi Masao, he served as an officer in the Japanese Imperial Army. He graduated from a military academy in Manchuria, where Kishi had once ruled over an industrial empire that was built on Chinese slave labor.
Territorial disputes over unimportant islands could be laid to rest.
The US presence allows East Asia’s rival powers to act irresponsibly.
Because Abe is the nationalist grandson of a former prime minister who was once arrested as a war criminal, and because he has paid public tribute to soldiers who died for the emperor in World War II, these protests might seem reasonable.
That is why the main goal of nationalist-minded Japanese leaders, starting with Abe’s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, has been the return of full Japanese sovereignty by revising Article 9.
On the contrary, his reinterpretation of the constitution is meant to help the US in its military policing of East Asia.
In fact, Chinese attitudes may be more complicated and less unified than they seem.
Israel’s defenders are right to point out that public opinion in Europe, and to a much lesser extent in the United States, tends to be much more critical of Israeli atrocities in Gaza than about bloodier violence committed by Muslims against Muslims in other parts of the Middle East.
The link between corrupting Jewish influence and the US was originally a right-wing trope.
If all Jews were responsible for the oppression of Arabs, attacks on Jews in Europe, or anywhere else, should be condoned, if not actively encouraged.
So, naturally, they applaud the Israeli government for using harsh measures to keep the Arabs down.
The world is increasingly fragmenting, with fearful people embracing smaller, defensive identities: Scottish, Catalan, Flemish, Sunni, Shia, Kurdish, and so on.
There is no room for Stalin’s mass murders in the kind of “patriotic” education favored by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In their efforts to revise the historical record, they are not really thinking of Koreans or Chinese, but of political adversaries at home.
Kishi’s aim was to regain Japanese pride and sovereignty by revising the constitution and reviving old-fashioned patriotism, thus undoing some of the American educational reforms.
Historical truth is not the point; political mastery is.
In the first case, Dmitri Borodin, the minister counselor at the Russian embassy in The Hague, was arrested late one night in October of last year, after neighbors alerted the Dutch police that Borodin, allegedly in a drunken state, was beating his two small children.
Because consular officials do not enjoy the same degree of immunity as higher-ranking diplomats, the police were acting within their authority, even if their methods – strip-searching Khobragade, for example – might be considered excessive.
Whether or not this is true is beside the point.
This, too, was very much a case of “keeping face”: the Chinese expected tribute; the British lord insisted on the equal status of his king.
She was born into the Dalit caste, the “untouchables,” who in former times would never have gotten anywhere near the elite, except to sweep their floors.
As individuals and societies become richer, they come into closer contact with one another – virtually, through communication technologies, and physically, through population growth, urbanization, and travel. Meanwhile, rising consumption of products like food, energy, and medicine enhances the externalities, or spillover effects, of individual choices, with the connectivity of global systems increasing these effects’ range and impact.
While it is impossible to safeguard the system fully, sound regulation and effective oversight could have prevented the crisis, or at least reduced its impact on millions of people’s livelihoods.
Financial regulation is driven by the interests of banks, health policy by the interests of insurance companies, and tax policy by the interests of the rich.
They are themselves shaped by ideas – beliefs about who we are, what we are trying to achieve, and how the world works.
Or do you turn inward and reward your military friends and other cronies, at the expense of almost everyone else? Authoritarian rulers in East Asia embraced the first strategy; their counterparts in the Middle East opted for the second.
Our interests are in fact hostage to our ideas.
It was economists and their ideas that made it respectable for policymakers and regulators to believe that what is good for Wall Street is good for Main Street.
People may have a taste for oranges or bananas, or a preference for enjoying life today instead of saving for the future.
Who people are and how they think of themselves is key to the decisions that they make.
This example is just the tip of the iceberg.
If they do not, they will seek to game the incentive system, rather than to meet the organization’s goals.

There is no humane slaughter requirement for wild fish caught and killed at sea, nor, in most places, for farmed fish.
To put this in perspective, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 60 billion animals are killed each year for human consumption – the equivalent of about nine animals for each human being on the planet.
Her recent book Do Fish Feel Pain? shows that fish are not only capable of feeling pain, but also are a lot smarter than most people believe.
The deluge of conflicting data relating to various foods’ costs and benefits exemplifies the challenge inherent in making informed decisions.
Using genetic-engineering techniques, the British company Oxitec has created new varieties of the mosquito species that transmit dengue fever.
With a little research, she would have discovered that male mosquitoes do not bite, and that the released mosquitoes (all male) die in the absence of their specially supplemented diet.
That definition is worthy of consideration as we reflect on the perils of ignorance in the twenty-first century.
You see where this could easily go: if we push far enough, most of us do not actually know, in the Platonic sense, much of anything.
That’s why we keep allowing ourselves to be talked into supporting unjust wars (not to mention actually dying in them), or voting for people whose main job seems to be to amass as much wealth for the rich as they can get away with.
The only thing that they agreed on was to admonish China to revalue its currency.
Governments are silent, acting more or less as if nothing important is happening.
Above all, every developed economy pursued policies designed to provide high wages, which would guarantee high consumption and thus rapid growth.
The US now borrows $2 billion a day, 95% of it from Asia and 45% of that amount from China’s central bank. America’s total debt exceeds 39 trillion dollars, or roughly 3.5 times US GDP.
Plugging the Leaks in Africa’s Economies
Abusive transfer pricing – in which legally related entities misprice goods or services – accounts for roughly 60% of the continent’s illicit capital flight, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.
Out of control tax incentives are another source of the problem.
In its Agenda 2063, the African Union emphasized the need to mobilize domestic resources toward sustainable and inclusive development.
But one recommendation – curbing illicit financial flows – was unexpected.
This, like money laundering by criminal organizations, is obviously illegal (as well as morally reprehensible).
If this effort produced just a 10% reduction in the average losses from illicit financial flows, compared to 2002-2012, it would save countries $768 billion – money that could be used to finance development projects.
Unfortunately, the existing framework for preventing money laundering does not offer an encouraging precedent.
This struck me last week when I listened to one of Egypt’s new online generation talking enthusiastically about the future.
People may want a world free of corruption, but it’s hard to understand how such a world works.
“Our government is going to set free-market prices just like yours.”
But in the real world, even online, things aren’t so easy.
The modernizers need to form a coherent force – and most likely a political party – rather than simply relying on the wisdom (and good behavior) of the crowd to govern the country.
Let’s take a case study, the last generalized boom-bust cycle in commodity prices, which caused these prices generally to rise (more or less) from some time in the 1960’s until the 1980’s, and then generally to fall until the mid-1990’s.
This was the time of the “great population scare,” which transformed thinking worldwide, no doubt contributing to higher commodity prices while the fear lasted.

Maybe that image was at least part of the reason why people became so worried in the 1970’s about population running ahead of resources.
While it may seem that no image in the last decade was so dramatic as the first photo of the earth from space, think again.
With so many vivid images of a shrinking and damaged planet, is it really any wonder that human psychology is ripe for high commodity prices?
Today, no less than yesterday, Mediterranean people – Muslims, Christians, and Jews –share inescapable geopolitical, demographic, and economic realities.
But the comments were widely interpreted as an echo of pronouncements a few days earlier by Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front party.
Indeed, the test of success of any new Mediterranean structure will be the degree to which it meets the aspirations and scrutiny of this young, politically aware generation throughout the region.
Yet consumer confidence, capital expenditure, and hiring have yet to take a sharp hit.
Mostly we are not even reminded of them.
The image of a bank run, of long lines of angry people lining up outside a failed bank, was briefly on our minds after the Northern Rock failure in Britain.
Psychology need only change enough to bring about a drop in consumption or investment growth of a percentage point or so of world GDP, and market repercussions can do the rest.
Its loans are limited to a multiple of a country’s contributions to its capital, and by this measure its loans to Greece are higher than any in its history.
But a crisis-wracked government will struggle to manage multiple demands.
Its rationale for doing so highlights the risks associated with its decision.
It will be difficult for the IMF to regain the trust of these increasingly prominent members.
Blanchard notes that in 2012, Greece agreed “to generate enough of a primary surplus to limit its indebtedness” and to implement “a number of reforms which should lead to higher growth.”
“Why insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75% of primary spending; the other 25% have already been cut to the bone.
Blanchard calls on Greece’s government to offer “truly credible measures.”
On this point, Greece and the IMF agree.
But the Greeks have already made tough choices.
This option should have been put on the table, recognizing that Greece has broader political reasons for staying within the eurozone.

Moreover, the skeptics overlook the fact that incentives to carry out structural reforms are partly endogenous.
In short, the IMF should not have made Europe’s concerns, about contagion or debt repayment, decisive in its decision-making.
WASHINGTON, DC – More than four years have passed since an overwhelming majority of the membership of the International Monetary Fund agreed to a package of reforms that would double the organization’s resources and reorganize its governing structure in favor of developing countries. But adopting the reforms requires approval by the IMF’s member countries; and, though the United States was among those that voted in favor of the measure, President Barack Obama has been unable to secure Congressional approval.
Removing the link between them would require the support of the US administration, but not ratification by Congress.
The Inequality Trifecta
But these are not normal times.
That is why it is so disappointing that, despite heightened awareness of inequality, the IMF/World Bank meetings – a gathering of thousands of policymakers, private-sector participants, and journalists, which included seminars on inequality in advanced countries and developing regions alike – failed to make a consequential impact on the policy agenda.
Such an approach would reduce the enormous policy burden currently borne by central banks.
Within two years, Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck.
He detested liberal critics.
At the center, a civilian-military conflict emerged, the German army having always had a state-within-a-state mentality and status.
For a moment in the spring of 1918 – after the Bolsheviks signed a German-dictated Carthaginian peace – a German victory seemed possible.
The consequences of their leadership became manifest only later, as an aggrieved nation’s people turned against each other in their deep political and moral divisions and hatreds.
Then, in the 1980’s, a revisionist history came along.
In its first episode, Ferguson appears amid the splendid monuments of China’s Ming Dynasty, which, in the fifteenth century, was undoubtedly the greatest civilization of the day, with its naval expeditions reaching the coasts of Africa.
But the question is whether it also provided, through Hegel’s “cunning of reason,” the means to escape from them.
Chinese savings are underwriting much of the American civilizing mission that Ferguson applauds.
Germany blames France, and vice versa.
But those rules were steadily weakened, and by the early 2000’s were widely derided (including by Romano Prodi, Delors’ successor as President of the European Commission), as governments found that they could run large deficits without paying higher market interest rates.
A legal vestige of the original plan may offer an easy path to a greater ECB supervisory role today.
At the time of his report, he concluded that the European budget would amount to some 3% of GDP – identical to the peacetime US federal budget’s share of GDP during the country’s first stage of monetary union, in the nineteenth century.
The implication is clear: American children require no more nuanced attention than animals or inanimate objects.
The study compared two sets of disadvantaged children, with one set receiving excellent nutrition and high-quality, stimulating care for eight hours a day from birth to age five, and the other receiving ordinary formula and care.
Early childhood educators with the same qualifications had an average annual salary of $27,000-28,000.
JERUSALEM – Israel’s 60th anniversary has come and gone.
The first scenario is when a real war threatens to spill over into a wider conflict, destabilizing the region and Great Power relations.
The US warned Israel not to get involved, and Israel was forced to comply.
When either of these two scenarios is lacking, American initiatives are stillborn.
No national conflict has ever been solved by outside powers, however well intentioned they may be.
It also puts city managers at odds with environmentalists, who campaign for restrictions on development to ease pressure on forests and watersheds.
Farmers near Beijing, for example, have been paid to convert croplands from rice to corn.
The authors of “The Urban Water Blueprint” have calculated that more than $18 billion could be productively directed toward conservation activities, saving cities money and creating a new market comparable in size to the market for the water sector’s existing technologies.
Land use and water security are firmly linked.
Free medicines are only part of the solution.
These children join more than 500,000 others in Xinjiang who have participated in the educational component of Health Express. By targeting schools as hubs for health-care education and shaping students into health ambassadors for their families and friends, we can reach an even greater number of people in Xinjiang’s nomadic communities.
With the world population growing rapidly (to an estimated 8.5 billion by 2030), the impact of climate change becoming increasingly apparent, and the amount of arable land dwindling, there can be no denying that achieving this goal will be a daunting challenge.
And innovation is already happening.
Another potential pitfall of agricultural development is environmental damage, including land degradation, soil nutrient mining, excessive water use, and water pollution.
We are confident that African leaders will rise to the challenge.
Reflecting these reforms, the International Monetary Fund recently projected that Italy will have a cyclically adjusted budget surplus of nearly 1% of GDP in 2013.
That would remove the serious risk that the ECB could start buying bonds on the basis of agreed fiscal packages, and then be forced to react if governments fall short on implementing them.
Moreover, the increase in exports and the shift from imports to domestically produced goods and services would strengthen their economies, thereby reducing their fiscal deficits as tax revenues rose and transfers declined.
In Cautious Praise of Latin America
Although growth has indeed been significantly above trend in recent years, performance over the entire decade was unimpressive.
Second, Latin America needs to overhaul its weak health and education systems.
It passed the crisis test with flying colors, and the future is promising.
Amnesty laws in Argentina at the time shielded him from prosecution.
Immediately after the announcement, Sudan’s government and its allies began a diplomatic campaign aimed at securing a Security Council deferral of the investigations for 12 months. They are attracting wider support than they should – in part because of fear of retaliation against UN peacekeepers and humanitarian workers.
Supporters of Europe’s social model claim that what distinguishes it is the importance placed on “social cohesion.”
Indeed, some policies aimed at achieving cohesion may well reduce it.
For example, during the referendum campaign in France for the European constitution, the “Polish plumber” became a symbol of the threat that European integration was supposed to pose to French workers’ standards of living.
But the conservative attitudes underlying opposition to change are anything but “social,” for they would deny the poorest of Europe’s poor a chance to improve their lot.
It poses, for example, no obstacle whatsoever to a criminal investigation.
So-called “fishing expeditions” – indiscriminate trawling through bank accounts – remain out of bounds.
The OECD’s founding convention calls on it to assist sound economic expansion and to contribute to growth in world trade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis.
There is no political risk involved; the Swiss have no powerful lobby in the United States or the EU that they can mobilize; as the birthplace of private banking, Switzerland has enormous symbolic value; as the world leader in private banking, it triggers jealousies.
The current crisis has exposed the original lacunae and widening cracks in the compact between Europe’s citizens and EU institutions, between Europe’s north and south, and between its peoples and its elites.
Germany, in particular, must acknowledge that, far from being an innocent victim, its economy is the eurozone’s biggest beneficiary – and has been since the euro’s inception.
If EU institutions are to regain trust and relevance, they need to articulate concrete policies and deliver on issues that bear directly on citizens’ interests – youth unemployment, urban planning, health care, bio-tech research, energy conservation, transport, and aging.
MILAN – Around the world, the debate about financial regulation is coming to a head.
Moreover, few would disagree that, as the complexity of the system increases, gaps and asymmetries in terms of information, knowledge, and expertise are multiplying.
One is the “perfect storm” position: there were very many failures, misperceptions, informational asymmetries, and complexities, as well as much repugnant behavior, but it never occurred to market participants, regulators, or academics that the aggregate effect would be a near-collapse of the system.
The finance industry, regulators, and political leaders need to create a shared sense of collective responsibility for the system as a whole and its impact on the rest of the economy.
Neither will fiddling with the rules.
By contrast, mainstream economists argued, a technologically advancing industrial society was bound to be different.
And increasing rewards for those at the increasingly sharp peak of the income distribution have not called forth enough enterprising market competition to erode that peak.
But Wolf’s solution is not enough, for the problem is not confined to high finance.
He was one who wanted to remain true to the tradition of the January Uprising and the Legions of Józef Piłsudski, to the tradition of the insurgents of the Warsaw ghetto and Warsaw Uprising, to the values of the Polish October and the student revolt of 1968, to the values of KOR (Workers’ Defense Committee) and of “Solidarity.”
He wanted a democratic Poland in a strong and democratic Europe.
But he also worried.
I appeal to my ancestry only in one single case: when I encounter an anti-Semite.
It has only sketchy economic policies toward Russia; ambitions, but no game plan, to become a player in the Middle East; and, despite its original leadership on the Kyoto Protocol, no successor program on climate change. And the biggest question of all – how to engage with China, India, and other giants of the future – has received virtually no attention from EU-level policymakers.
At the beginning of the 1980’s, when Europe was faltering and the media catchword was “Eurosclerosis,” 50% of people polled for the Eurobarometer surveys viewed membership as positive for their country.
That demand must be abandoned.
The trigger for imposing this code of conduct was a scandal over MPs’ expenses, which rocked Britain’s political class for much of 2009.
Upwardly mobile MPs from the ruling Labour Party claimed the trappings of their newly-acquired middle-class status: second homes, mock-tudor beams, and plasma screen televisions.
Duties of government, like fighting wars, educating children, or punishing criminals, are being outsourced to private companies.
Complexity, by leading to moral ambiguities, forces relationships onto a contractual footing.
But there will be less of it than in societies run by bureaucrats, courts, and policeman.
Legislation or regulation aimed at restoring faith in the political class should be a last, not a first, resort.
In particular, the two countries whose problems drove much of the need for twentieth-century European integration – Germany and Italy – were culturally and politically highly diverse.
Now it is European unity that is needed for economic reasons.
In the 1780’s, a new consensus against such measures emerged.
Traditional marriage vows entail a commitment that binds the partners through changing circumstances: for richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health.
We know these creatures' apotheosis, Dracula, as a vampire from Transylvania, a bat-like person with long canine teeth who lies in a coffin during the day and bites necks and drinks blood for sustenance.
Since the sixteenth century, Czar Ivan IV - Ivan the Terrible - was called the "Russian Dracula."
Vampires, according to eighteenth-century science, were nothing more than the product of victims' delirium.
Literary works in which people who committed cruel, bloody acts were transformed into vampires became popular from 1820 onwards.
For the first time in history, however, neither the laureate nor any member of his immediate family will be present in Oslo to accept the award.
Despite this ongoing persecution, Liu continued to write and petition the government on behalf of the people of China.
Though now better off than they have ever been in material terms, the Chinese people under the current regime are denied any real opportunity to retain and refine their own dignity beyond the quest for wealth and luxury goods.
Just as Czechoslovakia’s communist government once imprisoned Havel for daring to dream of a civil society and a true constitution of liberty for his country, China’s government has imprisoned Liu for attempting something similar, with his Charter 08 appeal, modeled on Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77.
The extent to which growth creates opportunities and improves living standards depends on an array of structural and institutional economic policies, including many in areas outside of education and redistribution (the areas most commonly featured in discussions about inequality).
Both types of policies – macroeconomic management and measures that boost inclusiveness – deserve equal attention in national economic strategies.
Achieving Education for All
Specifically, the Incheon Declaration calls for all people to gain access to 12 years of publicly funded education, of which at least nine years are compulsory.
Beyond getting children into school, efforts must be made to ensure the quality of the education they receive.
This begins with political will and the setting of priorities.
This approach – which will guide the efforts of a joint program launched earlier this year by UNESCO, UN Women, and UNFPA, with support from the World Bank, to empower adolescent girls and young women through education – ensures that initiatives will have the strongest impact.
How can it be minimized?
Why would capitalists extract so little value from workers if they could get so much more out of them?
Before anyone can consume a kilowatt-hour, a liter of water, or a bus ride, somebody has to get a copper wire, a pipe, and a road to their house.
In Kenya, where there are 50 mobile phones per 100 people, only 16% of the population has access to electricity.
A similar logic led to the expansion of the interstate highway system.
In developing and emerging economies, one charitable explanation for the poor quality of public discourse about income inequality is that data on income distribution are often unavailable or dubious.

The same exercise, which treats pensions as deferred consumption and therefore abstracts from the redistributive role of pensions among the older populations of the advanced economies, yields a drop of seven points in the United States and a bit more than nine points in the European Union.
But, because cash transfers are universal, rather than targeted at the poor, the overall effect is not progressive but neutral, another paper finds.
So income inequality is bound to prove politically controversial when it is worsening, and also when it tends to decline.
But there is surprisingly deep inequality in firms’ productivity, which means that the size of the pie varies radically.
To address the problem requires investing in inclusion, endowing people with skills, and connecting them to the inputs and networks that can make them productive.
In this context, if markets are characterized by what economists call perfect competition, once the opportunity cost of all inputs has been paid, there is nothing left to distribute.
As with land, the current intellectual property-rights regime, by over-protecting old ideas, may provide market power that not only exacerbates income inequality but also hurts innovation.
The global financial crisis shook up the international financial architecture, catching many institutions off guard.
Similarly, China’s sovereign wealth funds have served as important anchor investors in the vehicles designed by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation and the EBRD to bring long-term institutional capital into their projects.
Despite the remarkable size of China’s investment projects, the country’s leaders have so far remained relatively conservative in terms of institutional innovation.
And when it comes to the EBRD, China’s stake will be tiny, at least at first; the Chinese say they are there to learn.
This is no mere rosy scenario.
Inadequate financing means large classes, insufficient books and teaching supplies, poorly constructed schools, and aging infrastructure.
A World Bank study on language and mathematics showed that, for the same cost per pupil, private schools in the five participating countries (Colombia, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, Tanzania, and Thailand) performed 1.2-6.7 times better than public schools in terms of student achievement.
And, as the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) noted in 2010 “The demand for education services (in Africa) is rising at a faster rate than governments can supply.”
STRASBOURG – In the 1990’s, the world averted its eyes to genocide in Rwanda, and to the “Great Lakes War” in eastern Congo, which claimed upward of five million lives – the most in any war since World War II.
But the South gained these freedoms only in 2005, with the CPA, and only after a huge and bloody conflict.
South Sudan’s mineral wealth could also be substantial, though no one knows because exploration has been impossible for so long.
Renewed conflict could also drag in the United States (supporting the South) and China (Bashir’s key international backer) into a dangerous and potentially escalating proxy conflict of the kind that was common in Africa throughout the Cold War.
India, Iran, and the Case for Double Standards
They allege that the agreement creates a double standard, according to which only some countries may possess nuclear weapons.
This is not true of either North Korea or Iran.
The situation is made more difficult by the fact that oil prices are already at a record high, while US ground forces are busy in Iraq, thus reducing the credibility of American military threats to Iran.
India: No Longer Handcuffed to History
The dispute remained intractable, and dragged interminably through the courts.
They view the state as soft, pandering to minorities out of misplaced Westernized secularism.
The court’s decision thus is an affirmation of Indian pluralism and of the rule of law.
Basketball? No, the IPL is the newest Indian innovation revolutionizing that most staid of Victorian sports – cricket.
Today, the public’s obsession has made India into the sport’s global financial powerhouse, with advertisers and sponsors pouring unheard-of sums into the game.
Even the possibility that five tense, exciting, hotly-contested, and occasionally meandering days of cricketing could still end in a draw seems derived from ancient Indian philosophy, which accepts that in life the journey is as important as the destination.
A land divided by caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom, and costume is united in consensus around a great conviction: cricket.
That not only highlights the extent to which India has become a fulcrum in global politics, but also points to the exceptional composition of the new Security Council.
Issues like sanctions on Iran, the stop-and-start Middle East peace process, and the world’s response to a likely change of leadership in North Korea, will almost certainly appear on the Council’s agenda as well.
It should emerge from the experience with its reputation and credibility as a major global player enhanced.
At first, the hostility between India and Pakistan that arose soon after partition thwarted any discussion of the issue. In 1971, though, Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan, facilitated by India, allowed for the possibility of a solution, and a land-boundary agreement was concluded in 1974.
Even Jaitley, now India’s finance minister and a prominent cabinet member, has not expressed any opposition. And, given that Bangladesh gains the most from the settlement, both officially expanding its territory and enhancing its position relative to India, the deal should face no resistance there.
Already, Bangladesh’s Awami League government, which returned to power this year after a controversial election that was boycotted by the principal opposition party, has embraced an unprecedented level of cooperation with India on security and counter-terrorism issues.
The net result was a closer Indo-US relationship and a positive view of Bush that overrode unpopular actions such as invading Iraq.
First, India is wary that any Democratic administration will include the same proponents of nuclear nonproliferation who opposed Bush’s exemption for India.
“Iraq is yesterday’s problem,” said one advisor to an Indian audience several weeks ago.
This includes restoring ties with Europe, tightening the nuclear nonproliferation regime and possibly a restoration of China as the centerpiece of US policy in Asia.
Detractors on the right insist that the new laws will break the budget and undermine economic growth, while opponents on the left argue that they do not go far enough in covering all of India’s poor and vulnerable.
The decision to permit foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail and civil aviation has been pursued, even at the cost of losing a recalcitrant coalition ally.
For decades after independence – when Britain left the subcontinent one of the poorest and most ravaged regions on earth, with an effective growth rate of 0% over the preceding two centuries – India was seen as an impoverished land of destitute people, desperately in need of international handouts.
Concessional loans at trifling interest rates (between 0.25% and 0.75%, well below the cost of servicing the loans) are also extended as lines of credit, tied mainly to the purchase of Indian goods and services, and countries in Africa have been clamoring for them.
India has also commissioned 100 small development projects (mainly quick-gestation, small-scale social-sector projects), and pledged further funds for education, health, power, and telecommunications.
Whereas China’s omnipresence has provoked hostility in several African countries – a presidential candidate in Zambia even campaigned on an explicitly anti-Chinese platform – Indian businesses have faced no such reaction in the last two decades.

बहरहाल, भारत के लिए स्वयं को इस तरह से व्यवस्थित करना सही है। इसकी शासन प्रणाली इस विश्वास पर टिकी हुई है कि सौदेबाजी, असहमति, चिंतन, और समझौते की एकीकृत प्रक्रिया – न कि ऊपर से नीचे तक चुनौती रहित निर्णय लेने की प्रक्रिया – बुद्धिमत्तापर्ण, निष्पक्ष, और सफल नीति-निर्माण के लिए सबसे प्रभावी मार्ग है।
But the potential is far from uniform. According to a new report, more than half of India’s GDP growth between now and 2025 will come from just eight states (Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Uttarakhand), home to just 31% of the country’s population.
Interestingly, one-third of these clusters can be found in states that have delivered low to medium economic performance, or are located close to smaller, lesser-known towns in better-performing states.
MUMBAI – The global economy’s slowdown has not spared India.
This presupposes higher investment in health care, nutrition, and sanitation, so that India’s citizens are healthy and able; education tailored to developing skills that are valued in the labor market; and the creation of jobs in firms that have an incentive to invest in training.
These bodies are especially important in providing budgetary estimates, particularly for unfunded long-term liabilities.
The most stable form of financing, foreign direct investment, has the additional benefit of bringing in new technologies and methods.
As developed countries struggle with slow growth and large debt burdens, their interest in an open global system can no longer be taken for granted.
Startlingly, the central protagonist in most of these stories is that most peaceable and innocent of animals, the cow.
To be sure, there have been plenty of other repellent stories of intolerance that have nothing to do with cows.
Where beef was legally available, it was consumed not just by Muslims and other minorities, but also by many poorer Hindus, who could not afford other kinds of meat.
Indians have generally felt free to be themselves, within their dynamic and diverse society.
Now that power is becoming a tool of the unsavory agenda pursued by the Hindu chauvinists who enabled his rise.
Until 2003, the Indian Foreign Ministry had a single Africa division; it now has three: West and Central Africa, East and Southern Africa, and West Asia and North Africa.
ONGC-Mittal Energy is keen to secure blocks with proven reserves, but also is less concerned about the fine detail of the infrastructure packages than their Asian competitors.
India should not regard Africa as simply a source of natural resources.
NEW DELHI – As the New Year dawns, it has become increasingly clear that India’s new government faces a dilemma entirely of its own making – one that its predecessor never had to confront.
In fact, Modi’s rise was followed almost immediately by a series of attacks on India’s minorities, particularly Muslims.
The education ministry abruptly withdrew German as an optional third language in government schools, and replaced it with Sanskrit.
Similarly, Reibling added, Middle Eastern investors would respond to an anti-Muslim policy by cutting India out of their portfolios.
मोदी को मतदाताओं के सामने एक कूटनीतिपूर्ण (और उदारतापूर्वक वित्तपोषित) चुनाव अभियान के ज़रिए पेश किया गया जिसमें उन्हें व्यापार की समझ रखने वाले एक ऐसे नेता के रूप में चित्रित किया गया जिसने गुजरात राज्य को विकास के मॉडल में बदल दिया था और जो पूरे देश के लिए भी यही करेगा। युवा लोगों को नौकरियों के वादे के साथ, और पुराने मतदाताओं को सुधार और विकास की संभावना के साथ आकर्षित करके, मोदी ने एक ऐसा जनादेश हासिल किया जिसे देखकर देश के जनमत सर्वेक्षक दंग रह गए। इस बीच, कांग्रेस ने अब तक का सबसे खराब प्रदर्शन किया।
इसके अलावा, निवेशकों को आकर्षित करने और औद्योगिक विकास को बढ़ावा देने के लिए श्रम बाज़ार के उदारीकरण को अब भुला दिया गया है, जबकि पहले कभी इसे अपरिहार्य माना जाता था। सुधार के बारे में आशावादी बातों का स्थान अब आधिकारिक तौर पर "क्रमिक रूप से वृद्धि" के प्रति सम्मान ने ले लिया है।
NEW DELHI – It is not often that I get to wear two hats at once.
India is less urbanized than China, and it is in the early stages of benefiting from the virtuous forces that normally accompany that process.
My visits as chairman of the AMR review also allowed me to witness some encouraging signs.
But, given that India's investment climate seems to be improving, that moment might not be too far away.
To bring India up to speed, Modi’s government announced in August a national digital initiative: 1.13 trillion rupees ($19 billion) in investment to bring broadband communications to 250,000 villages, provide universal mobile access, expand online government services, and enable online delivery of all sorts of basic services.
For India to derive the full potential of these technologies, it will need to dismantle barriers to adoption.
India or China?
The race was finally on.
In such a world, continued hassles and hiccups for Chinese exports can be confidently expected.
सिंगापुर – चीन और भारत एशिया की जनसंख्या और शहरीकरण के रुझानों का संचालन कर रहे हैं। 2010 मैकेन्ज़ी अध्ययन के अनुसार, 2005 और 2025 के बीच इस महाद्वीप की शहरी आबादी में होनेवाली वृद्धि में इन दोनों देशों का हिस्सा 62%, और दुनिया भर में होनेवाली ऐसी वृद्धि में 40% जितना अधिक होने की संभावना है।
इसके विपरीत, भारत के शहरों का बेतरतीब विकास हुआ है जिसमें कुल मिलाकर शहरी प्रणालियों के सुचारू रूप से कार्य करने पर लगभग बिल्कुल ध्यान नहीं दिया गया है। उदाहरण के लिए, देश के शहरी क्षेत्रों में अक्सर पर्याप्त क्षेत्रीय परिवहन नेटवर्क की कमी रहती है। खाली पड़े शहर के भीतर के जिलों और उपनगरीय परिधियों में अनौपचारिक बस्तियों के बड़े-बड़े निर्माण हो रहे हैं जिनसे पर्यावरण की स्थितियों, सार्वजनिक स्वास्थ्य, और निजी सुरक्षा पर बुरा असर पड़ता है। भूमि उपयोग के स्वरूपों में औद्योगिक और आवासीय जिले मिले-जुले रूप में होते हैं, जिससे असुरक्षित (और बढ़ती हुई) आबादियों पर अनेक दुष्प्रभाव पड़ते हैं।



प्रभु के वादों में रेल लाइनों का सुधार और विस्तार करना, रेलवे स्टेशनों पर वायरलेस इंटरनेट शुरू करना, मानव-रहित लेवल क्रॉसिंग समाप्त करना, फोन पर शिकायत करने के लिए उपयोगकर्ताओं के लिए 24-घंटे टोल-फ्री नंबर तैयार करना, और महिला यात्रियों की रक्षा के लिए सुरक्षा कैमरे स्थापित करना शामिल हैं। उनके आलोचकों को ये सुधार काफी हद तक मामूली लगते हैं, और इनसे उनके अपने साथी सांसद बिल्कुल भी प्रभावित नहीं हुए हैं।
But putting in place an effective regulatory and enforcement infrastructure can be equally important, especially in areas where consumers have difficulty assessing the value of products and the risks they can pose.
For example, American, European, Japanese, and other drug regulators have developed guidelines, through the International Conference on Harmonization, that take advantage of their collective expertise.
The country made the safe acceleration of the approval process a high priority, and tremendous progress has followed.
It will require significant resources, and the process risks angering domestic companies that have become accustomed to a lack of regulatory oversight.
That reception was, of course, intended to nurture India’s collective ego, which had sensed a Sino-centric tilt to American policy ever since Obama became president.
The great diplomatic success of George W. Bush’s presidency (and maybe the only true one) was to construct a strategic partnership with India.
The time has come for India to recognize that with power comes responsibility, and to act like the indispensable nation for regional and world security that it has become.
But this debate misses a crucial point: the hypermarket model is itself under serious threat everywhere from online shopping.
For small shopkeepers, this poses both a challenge and an opportunity.
So India’s political debate over the entry of foreign retailers into the market, while heated, is probably already outdated.
It is likely that this operation was propelled from Pakistan through the Lashkar e Tauba, a terrorist organization sustained by hatred of secular India and backed by shadowy Pakistani agencies and street support.
It understands that you cannot blame the whole community for the sins of a few.
I am frustrated by the impotence of my government in Mumbai and Delhi, tone-deaf to the anguish of my fellow citizens.
Few countries are as dependent on the Persian Gulf region’s hydrocarbons as is India, which imports almost 80% of its consumption.
It was the Northern Alliance, backed by India, Iran, and Russia, that overthrew the Taliban regime in Kabul in late 2001 with the help of America’s air war.
But, far from being able to play the role of bridge-builder between the US and Iran, India is being forced to walk a policy tightrope, and its desire to chart a neutral course has annoyed both sides.
Throughout the Cold War, the world’s oldest democracy and its largest were essentially estranged.
Tempers cooled soon enough, but India was always regarded as tilting toward the Kremlin, hardly a recommendation for warm relations in American eyes.
But Obama – who had displayed a photograph of Mahatma Gandhi in his Senate office, carried a locket of the Hindu god Hanuman, and spoke often of his desire to build a “close strategic partnership” with India –struck the right symbolic chords in New Delhi and won over the fractious parliament.
India\u0027s Bollywood Power
It’s considered directly responsible for a spike in the sale of generator sets and even for absences from religious functions which clash with its broadcast times.
When a bhangra beat is infused into a Western pop record or an Indian choreographer invents a fusion of kathak and ballet; when Indian women sweep the Miss World and Miss Universe contests, or when “Monsoon Wedding” wows the critics and “Lagaan” claims an Oscar nomination; when Indian writers win the Booker or Pulitzer Prizes, India’s soft power is enhanced.
India’s Burma Dilemma
For 45 years, Myanmar’s people have been subjected to the junta’s reign of terror.
China balks at interfering in the “internal affairs” of a neighbor from whom it gets precious natural gas and potential access to the sea.
But the credibility of all democratic regimes, not just India’s, is at stake in what unfolds in Myanmar.
Indian information technology firms have opened offices in Shanghai, and Infosys’s headquarters in Bangalore recruited nine Chinese this year.
He is the most recognized worldwide symbol of a country that he has not seen for nearly five decades.
The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP, which led the previous government) has criticized the current administration for not “expressing concern over the use of force by the Chinese government” and instead “adopting a policy of appeasement towards China with scant regard to the country’s national honor and foreign policy independence.”
Yet, six decades later, the India that emerged from the wreckage of the British Raj is the world’s largest democracy, poised after years of rapid economic growth to take its place as one of the giants of the twenty-first century.
Despite many stresses and strains, India has a remained a freewheeling multi-party democracy – corrupt and inefficient, perhaps, but nonetheless flourishing.
For example, India permits all religions to flourish while ensuring that none is privileged by the state.
More generally, the logic of the electoral marketplace means that no single communal identity can dominate others.
Instead, the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal won convincingly.
But India takes electoral convulsions in its stride, and the results triggered no turmoil in financial markets.
By contrast, India strikes many as maddening, chaotic, divided, and seemingly directionless as it muddles its way through the second decade of the twenty-first century.
The reason that India, despite predictions of its imminent disintegration, has survived the stresses that have beset it during more than six decades of independence, is that it has maintained a consensus on how to manage without consensus.
They were in India to affirm their claim to it.
But both sets of fourth-wave migrants remain closely connected to their motherland.
But we should not get carried away: overseas Indians still invest a lower proportion of their resources in India than overseas Chinese do in China.
Reform has stalled amid profound political paralysis.
Rajan is a superstar academic researcher, a brilliant writer on political economy, and a former chief economist for the IMF.
True, India’s government must now consider growing threats to the country’s investment-grade credit rating.
Of course, India’s democratic government cannot simply bulldoze through people and the environment to create infrastructure.
But a series of scandals, some involving billions of dollars, has now seriously undermined that elite’s standing in the eyes of the Indian public.
The old aristocracy not only dominated the House of Lords, but also used its influence to get relatives, friends, and family retainers elected to the House of Commons by exploiting a key institutional weakness – the existence of “rotten boroughs” that could be bought and sold.
For Britain and the US, the transition in the nature of the governing elite was relatively smooth.
Still, as the recent controversy over the Nobel Peace Prize demonstrated, the government remains nervous about any dissent that challenges the legitimacy of the ruling elite.
As we know from Nazi Germany and other cases, such movements do not always lead to a happy outcome.
For all the attention that India’s retail revolution, information technology prowess, and booming manufacturing sectors have garnered in recent years, agriculture, on which 70% of the population still directly depends, is in crisis.
The new budget, recognizing the country’s acute water crisis, also calls for more money to expand irrigation.
But the strategy of embracing “poor-friendly” policies that deliver little real relief could backfire.
Indian companies have long recognized the opportunities in meeting previously overlooked demand at the “bottom of the pyramid.”
That’s jugaad.
Given that some five million Indians die of cardiovascular diseases every year, more than a quarter of them under 65, and that about two million die from drinking contaminated water, these innovations’ value is apparent.
The initial reviews are good.
NEW DELHI – Every year, during India’s rainy season, there is, equally predictably, a “monsoon session” of Parliament.
After a few more ineffectual minutes of trying to be heard above the din, the Speaker adjourned Parliament again.
Many of India’s new MPs – several of whom had been educated in England and observed British parliamentary traditions with admiration – reveled in the authenticity of their ways.
One of my abiding recollections from childhood was the photograph of a burly Socialist parliamentarian, Raj Narain, a former wrestler, being bodily carried out of the House by four sergeants-at-arms for shouting out of turn and disobeying the Speaker’s orders to return to his seat.
We need look no further than the temple of Indian democracy to see it in action.
Most of India’s major news outlets highlighted in their coverage of the story charges of corruption and ineptitude.
So President Patil has large shoes to fill. One can only hope that she will prove her critics wrong.
Like the American revolutionaries of two centuries ago, Indian nationalists fought for “the rights of Englishmen,” which they thought the replication of the Houses of Parliament would both epitomize and guarantee.
In 2010, an entire parliamentary session was lost when the BJP held it hostage to the party’s demand that government establish an investigative committee to inquire into an alleged act of corruption.
The result is that the vast majority of the public has lost respect for the “temple of democracy,” as the parliament is known.
India is now becoming divided in much the same way, and for much the same reason – the emerging system of “reserved places” aimed at redressing centuries of caste discrimination.
In addition, 76.2% of schools do not have clean drinking water, while 14.6% lack electricity.
It also happens to be the least expensive and most cost-effective support that government can provide.
India’s government has, no surprise, joined the rest of the world in calling for an end to the military action, but its criticism of Israel has been muted.
Whereas Israel notoriously exacts grim retribution for every attack on its soil, India has endured with numbing stoicism an endless series of bomb blasts, including at least six major assaults in different locations in 2008 alone.
When India’s embassy in Kabul was hit by a suicide bomber last July, American intelligence sources revealed that not only was Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence behind the attack, but that it made little effort to cover its tracks.
Every now and then, particularly before elections, caste groups demand to be placed on the list of “other backwards classes” (OBC’s), in order to benefit from these reservations.
The huge mass of evidence available in the censuses and land revenue settlement reports of the period from 1901 to 1931 lies ignored.
Thus, the economic status of households varied a great deal within each caste.
In some regions – Uttar Pradesh, Bombay (Maharashtra and Gujarat), and the Telugu speaking areas of Madras (Andhra Pradesh) – the lowest economic positions were occupied by some “backward” castes, not by untouchables.
But it is hypocritical to argue that this does anything to eliminate poverty.
Singh will open up India’s economy even more than he has so far.
Yet India continues to face many challenges: nearly 300 million people living in poverty, the spreading Naxalite insurgency, the danger of terrorist attacks ala Mumbai, and sprawling urban slums.
But the significance should not be missed.
But these instincts can be bolstered by wise long-term policies.
In short, the re-election of the Singh government has made the world a less dangerous place and has opened up many political opportunities.
While several provincial satraps have been cut down to size, new, aspiring ones have garnered significant support.
Increasing corruption within governments run by the Congress party, which led India to independence and monopolized political power for decades, showed what a lucrative career politics had become.
Like existing castes, the new caste specializes in one occupation: political office.
It rewards ambition, promotes office-at-any-cost politics, and devalues merit.
Instead, relations have been strained by the continuing refusal of Australia’s Labour Party government to sell uranium to energy-starved India for its civilian nuclear program.
Pakistan’s willingness to allow its territory to be used for attacks against India, like the assault on Mumbai in November 2008, inevitably carries the risk of sparking a larger conflagration, and its refusal to sign a “no first-strike” agreement with India is a serious cause for concern.
NEW DELHI – As the world awaits the Beijing Olympics, many wonder whether China’s grand coming-out party will also mark the occasion when it wrests dominance of the medal tally from the United States.
Our cricketers have come close to being considered the best in the world, but cricket is not an Olympic sport.
The explanations range from the anthropological to the borderline racist: Indians don’t have the genes, the build, the stamina, the climate, whatever. There are structural and infrastructural explanations: lack of training facilities, gymnasiums, running tracks, equipment, financial resources.
And if Indians can be better than white and black sportsmen on the cricket field, why can’t they beat them in an Olympic stadium?
For India’s nationalist leaders, this meant that every foreigner with a briefcase should be viewed as the thin edge of a neo-imperial wedge.
Indian-style socialism was a compound of nationalism and idealism.
Since then, India has become a poster child for globalization.
Three different coalitions have led India’s government since 1991, including one (from 1996 to 1998) that included Communists, and none has departed from the new “New Delhi” consensus.
Several controversial provisions included in the government’s last budget are being reviewed.
India’s growth has slipped, while his government has been consumed by one corruption scandal after another.
The Congress can rightly take credit for the most far-reaching such program, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which assures one member in every poor rural family 100 days per year of paid employment.
The prime minister who has done the most to make this possible has returned to the charge, clearly determined to consolidate his legacy after a spate of bad-news stories.
Populist policies that transfer scarce budget funds to hundreds of millions of rural men and women end up encouraging them to withdraw their labor services, driving up wages and undermining international competitiveness.
One key to India’s economic success is a large population of technically educated entrepreneurs, who are creating new companies and building a modern middle class.
One sign of progress is that a new cabinet committee, chaired by Singh, will review large private investment projects that have been held up by regulatory issues or other legal barriers.
But I am betting that India is rising again: millions more will be lifted out of poverty in the coming years, while the increasingly prosperous Indian middle class will expand further.
Contrary to China, India finds it difficult to adapt to its status as an emerging “Great Power.”
But India does not seem to know how to deal with its northwestern neighbor, and even less whom to deal with in its government.
What prevails nowadays in New Delhi and Moscow is simple pragmatism.
MUMBAI – Every day, a small Japanese jet brings another 60 businessmen from Tokyo to sniff out new commercial opportunities in Mumbai and the heart of the Indian economy.
The grand old Taj deserves all the business it is getting, after being the target of a terrorist attack in 2008.
They do not expect much from the state and are not surprised when it fails to deliver.
In many rich OECD countries, the financial crisis and recession have made government intervention popular again.
First, as India’s middle class expands, more must be done to ensure that economic growth is inclusive.
Yet it is also home to 300 million of the world's poorest people.
Chidambaram's 2004/2005 budget puts those fears to rest.
There are an estimated 600,000 villages in this vast country of one billion citizens.
But even India, with its growing economy, cannot afford to make these investments out of national resources.
Indeed, the government says that the growth rate will hit double figures soon.
If it is not used now, it will dissipate.
Raising farm productivity and income requires improved irrigation, wasteland reclamation, warehousing, marketing, transport development, and the free movement of produce within the country.
It is not the amount of money allocated by government that matters.
PARIS – When it comes to compensation, the company you work for often matters more than how good you are at what you do.
But even in advanced economies, where social protection is broad in scope, access to benefits is far from equal.
But it should ensure that all participants in the labor force, whatever their status, enjoy equal access to essential benefits; and it should aim at minimizing the losses that impede mobility across firms, sectors, and types of employment.
Points earned could be spent on lifelong education and professional training, which would thus become independent from employment status.
Employees nowadays are often lost in the complexity of the various social benefits to which they are entitled.
MANILA – Every year, forest fires ravage Indonesia, causing massive environmental, social, and economic devastation.
And, like coal, peat stores massive amounts of carbon, which is released into the atmosphere when the land is burned, cleared, and drained to make way for plantations.
To build on this, consumers and markets also need to send signals to companies that directly or indirectly support slash-and-burn farming.
Indonesia’s Democratic Islam
Indeed, Syafi’i Ma’arif, the former chair of Muhammadiyah, has made pluralist arguments, grounded in the Koran, against blind obedience to Islamic classical jurisprudence.
In one particularly absurd case, a group of Muslim feminists who wrote a book promoting women’s rights based on Koranic exegesis had to publish their work in secret, because it included arguments for women’s reproductive rights and a small percentage of the group’s funding came from a foundation that had received money from USAID.
But that is difficult to do.

Today, however, many of those Chinese have returned.
Some credit the 2004 tsunami, which killed hundreds of thousands of Acehnese, for this breakthrough.
These punitive policies are self-defeating.
Organizers of Bali’s renowned Ubud Writers and Readers Festival have just had a foretaste of what may be a new round of active censorship, with local officials threatening to cancel the entire festival if proposed panel discussions of the massacres went ahead.
The following evening, Major General – later President – Suharto led a successful counter-coup.
Things may, however, be starting to change, especially following the release three years ago of Joshua Oppenheimer’s extraordinary documentary film, The Act of Killing.
This is true not only of China, Singapore, France, and Brazil – countries usually associated with such policies – but also for the United Kingdom, Germany, Chile, and the United States, whose industrial policies are often less explicit.
These pervasive failures appear to be due mostly to governments’ inability to align their efforts with their country’s resource base and level of development.
If domesticprivate firms in these sectors are already present, policymakers should identify and remove constraints on those firms’ technological upgrading or on entry by other firms.
PALO ALTO – One of the worst responses by officials to the financial crisis and deep recession has been to revive “industrial policy.”
Because private investors are unable to appropriate the returns, private markets invest too little in basic science.
In the 1980’s, advocates of industrial policy praised its extensive use in Japan.
Government should set general goals for energy and the environment and then let entrepreneurs, investors, and consumers decide how best to achieve them.
Much the same is true within countries.
Is that the choice we have to make then: freedom or equality?
Another difficult question is how the basic status is to be guaranteed.
Nevertheless, while a free society recognizes limits to inequality, it also accepts that inequality exists, for it provides hope for many by showing what one might achieve with ability and luck – or perhaps even luck alone.
So India must “take steps that reduce social and economic inequalities, without hurting the process of growth and without reducing the incentives for individual enterprise and creativity.”
Nevertheless, one wonders why the evidence that inequality causes social unrest is not stronger.
An article by Ernst Fehr at the University of Zurich and Alexander Klein and Klaus Schmidt at the University of Munich in the January 2007 issue of the journal Econometrica shows how people design economic relationships based on their knowledge of the circumstances in which people are trustworthy.
In such cases, inequality may be perceived more intensely, for people may link it with the loss of good will.
The insight (obvious in retrospect) underlying Airbnb’s model – and the burgeoning sharing economy in general – is that the world is replete with under-utilized assets and resources.
Second, the platform must create trust – in the product or the service – on both sides of the transaction.
The McKinsey Global Institute has recently studied internet-based approaches to the labor market and the challenge of matching demand for talent and skills with supply.
Clearly, issues relating to liability and insurance will have to be addressed in all sharing-economy models, especially financial ones; but these are hardly insurmountable obstacles.
But in 2003, following five years of deflation, China’s economy entered a new phase.
The central bank (PBOC) initially attributed it to excess liquidity, and so began to use monetary policy tools, raising interest rates five times since late 2007.
As a result, with investment demand remaining robust, inflation could spread.
CAMBRIDGE – It is time for the world’s major central banks to acknowledge that a sudden burst of moderate inflation would be extremely helpful in unwinding today’s epic debt morass.
But right now, the global economy is teetering on the precipice of disaster.
As the recession deepens, however, bank balance sheets will be hammered further by a wave of defaults in commercial real estate, credit cards, private equity, and hedge funds.
Indeed, it seems like avoiding sustained deflation , or falling prices, is all they can manage.
CAMBRIDGE – The investors that I talk to these days are not sure whether to worry more about future inflation in the United States or about future deflation.
But such a strategy can work only in countries where the duration of the government’s debt is long and the interest rate on that debt is fixed.
The other broad components of the consumer price index have increased in recent months, and the consumer price index is up about two percentage points over the past 12 months.
The Deflation Bogeyman
They are doing this by promising to keep short-term rates low; maintaining large portfolios of private and government bonds; and, in Europe and Japan, continuing to engage in large-scale asset purchases.
But Japan has experienced a low rate of inflation and some sustained short periods of deflation without ever producing a downward price spiral.
The result has been a massive mispricing of financial assets.
As pro-democracy protests shake Arab authoritarian regimes, the prospect of sustained conflict threatens a global economy still dependent on oil, while the aftermath of the Japanese earthquake and nuclear accident raises doubts about the security of nuclear energy.
The debate in the 1970’s – the period of the last general inflationary surge – has become relevant again.
And they produce an economic basis for discontent – which played at least some part in triggering the protests of the “Arab Spring.”
As the statistical manipulation that attends uncertainty increases, confidence is eroded.
If, instead of “Arab Spring,” we had spoken of “Arab revolutions,” we might have had more realistic expectations.
Today, however, a much larger part of the population, both within and among countries, has access to the power that comes from information.
Individuals and private organizations – including WikiLeaks, multinational corporations, NGOs, terrorists, or spontaneous social movements – have been empowered to play a direct role.
In other words, some aspects of the information revolution help the small, but some help the already large and powerful.
LONDON – Is it acceptable for doctors to withhold information from their patients? Some claim that it is not only acceptable; it is desirable.
The junior doctor, uncomfortable with this deceit, asked the minister’s wife for permission to tell the truth, and after much hesitation, she agreed.
One problem is that doctors receive little formal training in obtaining consent, with medical schools teaching only the basics.
She was just a few feet away from a hysterectomy.
We can ask the doctor what she would do in our position, or what advice she would give if the patient was her own child or parent.
विश्व बैंक पहले ही एक दशक के भीतर बुनियादी ढाँचा परियोजनाओं का विस्तार करके अपने ऋण को दोगुना करना चाह रहा है। इसकी नई वैश्विक बुनियादी ढाँचा सुविधा (GIF) विशिष्ट परिसंपत्ति वर्ग के रूप में बुनियादी ढाँचे में निवेश करने के लिए वैश्विक पेंशन और श्रेष्ठ संपदा निधियों को जुटाएगा।
यह ख़ास तौर से ऊर्जा, जल, परिवहन, और सूचना और संचार प्रौद्योगिकी (ICT) में बुनियादी ढाँचे में निवेश के मामले में होता है। उदाहरण के लिए, अफ़्रीका में बुनियादी ढाँचा विकास के लिए कार्यक्रम में 2040 तक इन क्षेत्रों में $360 बिलियन मूल्य की "विश्वसनीय विशाल-परियोजनाओं" की योजना बनाई गई है। खनन कार्य और तेल और गैस पाइपलाइनों के समर्थन के लिए PIDA सौर, पवन, और भूतापीय जैसी अक्षय ऊर्जा प्रौद्योगिकियों को दरकिनार करते हुए, ऊर्जा (ख़ास तौर से जल-विद्युत) परियोजनाओं को प्राथमिकता देता है। इसी तरह की चिंताएँ एशिया में दक्षिण अमेरिका में क्षेत्रीय बुनियादी ढाँचे के एकीकरण की पहल और आसियान बुनियादी ढाँचा निधि की परियोजना "पाइपलाइन" के मामले में भी हैं।
SINGAPORE – Infrastructure projects can be among the most productive investments a society can make, with clear links to a country's economic growth.
In order to overcome the obstacles to investment, we propose the creation of an asset class that we call “buy-and-hold equity" (BHE).
Ideally, the investment platform would create a sustained project pipeline by establishing a private-sector-funded structure that does not solely rely on governments or international financial institutions to bring ventures to the market.
We have also learned that only 20-40% of the breast cancers that cluster in families come from BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations – genetic alterations that are present from birth in every cell of the body and can be transmitted to the offspring.
Several national networks and consortia have already developed models for estimating the breast cancer risk in women with a positive family history.
Last, but not least, criteria have to be established to define when and to whom genetic testing should be offered.
But when the time comes to pay for the ride, you may feel like you are in Boston, Luxemburg, or Zurich: the value of the Brazilian real, like the currencies of many emerging-market countries, is high – and could go higher.
For a decade now, the world economy has suffered from tremendous global imbalances: massive external surpluses in countries like China, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, and the oil producers, matched by equally large external deficits in the US, the United Kingdom, Spain, and others.
Europe, gripped by a tremendous banking and debt crisis, is not an attractive destination, and loose monetary policy in the US has produced ultra-low bond yields there.
Massive capital inflows caused real-estate and stock-market bubbles in the US and parts of Europe.
All we can look forward to is the next G-20 communiqué.
In brief, innovation will only truly take off with the understanding that the world is rapidly changing, extremely dynamic and volatile, and that the future is unpredictable.
Theories are never certain and must always be prepared for an uncertain future.
Developed-country governments scramble to subsidize technology that could be the Next Big Thing.
Companies that depend solely on their products’ commercial appeal are limited in the kinds of innovations that they can safely introduce, because if one of their products fails in the marketplace, they may not survive to build another one.
Because of the reward structure, these efforts could be coordinated, rather than pursued in isolation.
But there is little risk in offering a contract for a job well done: there is no payout if the problem remains unsolved.
The economic planners and policymakers who are chasing Silicon Valley’s taillights are learning that they cannot always replicate the entrepreneurial culture and finance mechanisms that flourish there now.
Most of these private securities were sold to oil-exporting countries and Europe, in particular Germany, Britain, the Benelux countries, Switzerland, and Ireland.
The propaganda was successful. Even in 2008, the US was able to attract net capital inflows of $808 billion.
The authors therefore called the process of constructing CDOs “alchemy,” the art of turning lead into gold.
The US will have to reinvent its system of mortgage finance in order to escape the socialist trap into which it has fallen.
JOHANNESBURG – Nowadays, Africa’s economic potential – and the business opportunities that go with it – is widely acknowledged.
But, throughout the continent, market opportunities for consumer-facing companies are concentrated more in cities than in particular countries.
And half of all respondents claim to make daily sacrifices to save for major expenditures.
At higher levels of income, markets become saturated and growth slows.
They are more than twice as likely to search for information online and to seek products and stores that reflect the “right image.”
Mixed signals from competing power centers don’t help; nor does the recurring contrast between Iranian officials’ usually-strident public pronouncements and often-moderate private discourse.
Second, it is well understood that there is zero tolerance in Russia and China for an Iranian bomb, and all the rope that that these powers have so far given Iran in the Security Council will run out if Iran weaponizes.
And it is not without plausibility: Iran did not, after all, respond in kind when it was bombarded with chemical weapons by Iraq.
LEEDS – Thailand’s former prime minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, recently ignited a furor when he proposed that the separatist campaign in his country’s Muslim-majority southern provinces might be solved politically, with a form of self-rule.
According to counter-insurgency expert David Kilcullen, the violence in Thailand’s deep South – which has now claimed more than 3,500 lives – was some of the most intense in the world between 2004 and 2007, “second only to Iraq and Afghanistan during this period.”
Again, reporting such a messy story is a challenge; most Western news editors have preferred to highlight Iraq and Afghanistan.
Few of them seriously believe that a tiny separate Patani state, wedged between Thailand and Malaysia, would be viable.
To the east lie Iraq and Iran.
Indeed, Turkey lacks its neighbors’ oil and gas resources, but it compensates for this with the competitiveness of its industry and services.
To its credit, Turkey has begun to invest heavily in sustainable technologies.
Turkey has been deft in seizing these new opportunities, with exports increasingly headed south and east to the emerging economies, rather than west to high-income markets.
No doubt, Turkey’s ability to continue on a rapid growth trajectory remains uncertain.
Everyone wants economic stability, and many are reluctant to abandon today what gave them stability yesterday.
If a considerable fraction of the world economy wants to run a current-account surplus (by 2006, this included much of emerging Asia, most oil exporters, and Japan), an equal share of the world economy must run a deficit.
Yet the pattern of exchange-rate movements in the rest of the world has been largely unrelated to existing current-account positions. In fact, currencies of surplus countries with heavily managed exchange rates have actually depreciated in real effective terms since the summer, creating inflationary pressure and frustrating global adjustment.
The risks to global growth will increase as long as adjustment remains uneven.
One can debate whether a referendum is the most appropriate vehicle for asking for their consent, but ask one must.
It is normal for conservatives to argue for less government and to place greater trust in free markets, and for social democrats and greens to argue for public policies that deliver less income inequality, more public goods (such as a clean environment and public transport), and more regulation to help markets function with greater stability and distribute benefits more evenly.
And yet Cameron is right to believe that not all EU members will want or be able to be part of a more integrated eurozone.
Many details would have to be worked out. But this may be a vision that gives Europe a chance to remain big and inclusive, while retaining the politically integrated core that the eurozone needs.
In a study presented in early May at America’s National Bureau of Economic Research, the economists Dwight Jaffee, Howard Kunreuther, and Erwann Michel-Kerjan called for a fundamental change in policy aimed at developing true long-term insurance (LTI) that set insurance premiums for many years.
Meteorology is not an exact science, and we cannot predict the precise extent and impact of environmental initiatives, though progress in weather forecasting might also reduce the damage caused by hurricanes.
But trying to address these risks by limiting such increases doesn’t work well, because if insurance companies are not making any money, they will withdraw from the market.
In areas where scientists think that there is a likelihood that greater risks will prevail in coming years, high insurance premiums would provide a market incentive to curtail development.
Although these booms were initially financed by domestic capital, they soon became dependent on foreign capital, which flowed into their economies as advanced-country central banks pumped huge amounts of liquidity into financial markets.
But, unsurprisingly, they did not; rather, they succumbed to the notion that unprecedentedly high rates of GDP growth were the new normal.
The difference is that China has implemented structural – and thus longer-lasting – credit-based policies, while other emerging economies have been drawn into a cyclical lending binge.
So it is important to consider the causes of underinsurance and whether our insurance institutions are adequate to the risks that we face.
Insurance policies that clearly specify the amounts that will be paid and the types of damage that will be covered are far better than the government-administered, after-the-fact bailout that many people seem to have expected.
If it were fully implemented, which is unlikely, it would constitute a revolution in risk management in the US similar to that of the creation of Social Security in 1934.
The total value of outstanding cat bonds is small by Katrina standards.
Indeed, the Arab Union estimates that the lack of regional integration costs each country two percentage points of annual GDP growth, while the African Economic Commission reckons that if a Maghreb Union existed, the five countries would each gain 5% of GDP.
Regional integration could contribute to higher growth in two ways.
Nothing highlights the benefits of regional integration as starkly as major infrastructure projects that are of common interest to several countries.
Intellectual-Property Rights and Wrongs
The growth of the “open source” movement on the Internet shows that not just the most basic ideas, but even products of enormous immediate commercial value can be produced without intellectual property protection.
Moreover, so-called “patent thickets” – the fear that some advance will tread on pre-existing patents, of which the innovator may not even be aware – may also discourage innovation. After the pioneering work of the Wright brothers and the Curtis brothers, overlapping patent claims thwarted the development of the airplane, until the United States government finally forced a patent pool as World War I loomed.
If they had, would they have willingly condemned thousands of AIDS sufferers to death because they might no longer be able to get affordable generic drugs? Had the question been posed in this way to parliaments around the world, I believe that TRIP’s would have been soundly rejected.
And yet, despite numerous attempts to create one, there is no global legal body leading the fight against terrorism. It is time for that to change.
It would have a prosecutor and a reasonable number of judges, nominated with a view to balanced representation of the world’s principal legal systems and geographical regions, and to gender equity.
I chaired a panel on cyber peace and security that included a Microsoft vice president and two foreign ministers.
In little more than a generation, the Internet has become the substrate of the global economy and governance worldwide.
The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime, but the other two may become greater threats over the next decade than they are today.
Limiting all intrusions would be impossible, but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism.
International norms tend to develop slowly.
Similarly, the Japanese came to regret the appreciated yen after the Plaza Accord succeeded in bringing down an overvalued dollar.
This concern has been reflected, for example, in complaints about intervention by China and other emerging markets to prevent currency appreciation.
They view budget deficits as creating negative spillover effects for neighbors, owing, for example, to the moral hazard of bailouts.
Exchanges of views might help narrow differences in perceptions.
CAIRO – In one of his last essays, the late, great historian Tony Judt asked what we should have learned from the last century, a period in which so many soldiers and civilians died in conflict.
I was attempting to explain why the rule of law mattered so much to the territory's future, and I noted that when I was in the British government, the law applied to me just as much as to those I helped govern.
Indeed, he has made it a regular feature of Russian foreign policy, which is characterized by deceit, bullying, violence, and the desire to restore the empire that was dismembered after the collapse of communism.
Those US politicians who regard international institutions as anti-American conspiracies are continuing the harm, costing their country much of its moral authority.
WARSAW – Russia-instigated violence has returned to Ukraine.
Against this background, it will undoubtedly be extremely difficult to create an international order that strikes the needed balance between legitimacy and power. To meet this challenge, three potential approaches stand out.
Still, the recognition of China as a true global power would force the US to come to terms with its declining hegemony and compel China’s leaders to recognize their international responsibilities.
NEW YORK – When it comes to funding development, taxes are perhaps the most critical piece of the puzzle.
Indeed, the International Monetary Fund recently reported that developing countries lose three times more of their corporate-tax revenue to BEPS activities than their developed counterparts.
A first step toward achieving these objectives would be the establishment of an intergovernmental body with the mandate and resources to push through much-needed tax reform, while promoting stronger tax cooperation among governments.
Inequality and the Internet
Unless the benefits from information-age goods and services greatly outstrip what we spend on them, the wellbeing they provide will have already been accounted for.
Put in economic terms, that is an extra rise of 0.6% per year in standards of living since 1990, a far larger increase than the 0.2% per year that reliance on conventional measures would lead us to conclude.
OXFORD – Over the last decade, the number of new Internet users tripled.
Finally, women comprise 52% of the offline population and only 42% of the online population.
The lack of relevant local-language content may also limit use.
Nearly half of the world’s offline population lives in ten countries that face a significant struggle to overcome all four barriers.
Doing so would create considerable potential for economic growth.
This massive transition will transform how citizens interact with their governments, revolutionize entire industries, and change the way we engage with one another. In Europe, the Internet of Everything is emerging as the single most promising way to revive a moribund economy and tackle the continent's stubborn unemployment problem, with companies, cities, and even countries positioning themselves as leaders in innovation, growth, and the creation of jobs.
Many countries are doing just that, implying that the next game-changing technology may not come from Silicon Valley; it could just as easily be developed in a lab in Paris, London, or Berlin.
As Europe charts its economic course for the next decade, its leaders must ensure that digital transformation forms the foundation of their strategy. This will allow them to create a Europe that is stronger, faster, more dynamic – and more digital.
President Bush cited seeming huge job growth in the last 13 months, claiming that America's labor market turned the corner.
True, the economy was slowing when Bush took office, but he also inherited an enormous fiscal surplus, amounting to 2% of GDP, which he transformed into a yawning deficit, equaling 4.5% of GDP.
Critics warned that the war would cause instability in Iraq and the Middle East, and that this would lead to high oil prices.
The second threat to economic recovery is high oil prices.
Without grasping what has gone wrong in either area, it will be difficult to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
Emerging-market central banks diversified out of dollars and into gold.
China’s economy continues to soften; India’s growth rate is down sharply from a few years ago.
If you are a high-net-worth investor, or a sovereign wealth fund, it makes perfect sense to hold a small percentage of your assets in gold as a hedge against extreme events.
Ignoring the fact that bread in Babylon was probably healthier than today’s highly refined product, the price of gold today is not so different, equal to perhaps 600 loaves of bread.
जाहिर तौर पर, मध्य पूर्व में पश्चिमी हस्तक्षेप कोई नई घटना नहीं है। ईरान, मिस्र और तुर्की के अपवादों को छोड़कर, मध्य पूर्व में हर प्रमुख शक्ति मुख्य रूप से ब्रिटिश और फ्रेंच द्वारा बनाया गया एक आधुनिक निर्माण है। 2001 के बाद से अफगानिस्तान और इराक में संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका के नेतृत्व वाले हस्तक्षेप पश्चिमी शक्तियों द्वारा क्षेत्र की भू-राजनीति को ठीक करने के लिए किए गए अभी हाल के प्रयास को दर्शाते हैं।


We went to mass at midnight.
Sometimes, the symbols of the event become very confused.
It certainly should not, although we can recall terrible periods of Christian intolerance and bigotry.
Destroy that and you destroy the hallmarks of liberal order.
As the Irish comedian Dave Allen used to say, “May your God go with you.”
For example, an endowment or pension fund might consider basing its payout decisions more on long-run, potential shock-adjusted average returns than on a simple weighted average of past returns or end-period asset values (the normal practice now).
Put another way, when returns seem abnormally high for an extended period, they probably are, and something – even if we don’t know in advance what – is likely to bring them down.
But there are two other aspects of liquidity management that deserve attention.
DALLAS – As rising consumption and nationalism in OPEC countries pushes down their crude-oil exports and forces international oil companies to invest in high-cost areas with small reserves as global demand continues to grow, oil prices might ultimately shatter the record set in 2008.
Second, the difference between actual output and what the markets expected magnified the impact of falling production.
Looking forward, in the short run, speculators will continue to fuel oil-price volatility as bullish and bearish factors steer them one way or the other.
Inviting the Avoidable
So the BIS proposes nothing new or particularly attention-grabbing.
Treasury Secretary John Snow has spent almost no public time on the budget, but a lot of public time on China. Republican political operatives care far less about national savings than they do about manufacturing-sector job losses.
Sanctions, of course, have a dismal historical record in achieving their aims.
American attitudes toward Iran are probably far more conditioned by that episode than people realize.
While most of the world may have missed it, there is an ongoing competition between Iraq’s Najaf and Iran’s Qom over which city is holier.
This would not be an easy process, and could well meet considerable Iranian resistance.
They need to convey through their own bilateral approaches to Iran a sense of urgency – and perhaps even express a little anger – at Iran’s unwillingness to negotiate seriously.
This combination of hegemonic aspirations, questioning of the regional status quo, and a nuclear program is extremely dangerous.
Nor, however, is the debate about the military option – the destruction of Iran’s nuclear program through US air strikes – conducive to resolving the issue.
Indeed, the two other options – Iran’s emergence as a nuclear power or the use of military force to prevent this – would, in addition to all of its horrible consequences, also increase oil and gas prices.
But such an initiative can succeed only if the American administration assumes leadership among the Western nations and sits down at the negotiating table with Iran.
Under Khamenei’s leadership, an unholy trinity of nouveau-riche Revolutionary Guardsmen, hard-line clergymen, and indoctrinated Basij militiamen increasingly wield power.
If the Green Movement is to mount a serious challenge to the government it must incorporate support from bazaar merchants, workers in major industries, transportation unions, and government workers.
The second challenge for the US is to champion human rights and democracy in Iran without compromising the independence of opposition forces.
Iran’s theocratic mullahs allowed the election of Hassan Rowhani, a man who announced in his first speech as President-elect that his victory is “the victory of wisdom, moderation, and awareness over fanaticism and bad behavior.”
He toured Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya in September 2011 and received a hero’s welcome.
Khamenei and his fellow guardians of Iran’s Islamic revolution were able to weather the 2009 storm, but their façade of legitimate power was collapsing.
But enough for what?
To be sure, we do not know the degree, direction, or pace of change.
Moreover, while a preventive strike would delay Iran’s nuclear efforts, it would not stop the regime from rebuilding, and it might also create conditions that cause problems for the regime’s domestic opponents.
It is not difficult, however, to determine which one is preferable.
The nature of illusion is that we mistake what we perceive for reality.
Its vision was shaped by the recent independence struggles of many of its member countries, and its agenda promoted national sovereignty, non-interference, a rebalancing of North-South relations, and support for national liberation movements.
But the participants’ inability to reach a common position on their hosts’ nuclear program or the violence in Syria – two of the fundamental questions that confronted the summit – obviously undermined Iran’s effort to demonstrate that, despite facing severe economic and diplomatic sanctions, it remains an effective international player.
From 2003 to 2006, Iran made clear to anyone willing to listen that it would agree to all the key elements of the recent deal, including measures to block uranium and plutonium pathways to a bomb and obtrusive monitoring mechanisms to ensure ample advance notice of a likely breakout.
But with the US not talking to Iran at any level, and the EU talking but not listening, the effort went nowhere.
It knows that it would face attack by a much more heavily armed Israel, whether supported by the US or not; that Sunni powers in the region could move quickly to counter a “Shia bomb” with their own nuclear weapons; and that additional crushing international sanctions could be imposed.
Intelligent diplomacy beats brute force every time.
Soon after Kennedy assumed the presidency in 1961, he was “informed” by the CIA of its plot to overthrow Fidel Castro.
Viewed through the lens of history, the main job of US presidents is to be mature and wise enough to stand up to the permanent war machine.
Few Americans know that the CIA overthrew a democratic Iranian government in 1953.
The US is not a partisan in the Shia-Sunni struggle; if anything, the US confronts mainly Sunni terrorism, funded from Saudi Arabia, not Shia terrorism backed by Iran.
It was allowed to fly for about half an hour over southern Israel before being shot down by the Israeli air force over a sparsely populated area.
After several months of listening to Israeli (and, to some extent, US) war rhetoric, the regime began issuing its own menacing bombast, as a matter of substance and to defend the pride of a regime that views itself as the heir to the glorious imperial tradition of Persia.
Iran’s war rhetoric and threat to inflict a deadly blow on Israel is served by dispatching a drone in the general direction of Dimona.
Let us hope that the Americans act in time.
Turkey is a NATO member, and any violation of its territorial integrity could easily trigger the North Atlantic Treaty’s mutual-defense clause.
The key strategic question, however, will not be resolved on the region’s battlefields, but in the various negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program.
No single global power is likely to manage that alone.
As sanctions are lifted, Iran will become stronger, challenging the influence of the Gulf States.
Meanwhile, relief from sanctions, together with the gradual return of international companies, kick-starts Iran’s ailing economy.
Rouhani and his allies are unable to offer ordinary Iranians economic hope – a failure that causes them to lose both the legislative and presidential elections.
The framework agreement benefits all parties.
From the start of the twentieth century, the British Empire manipulated Persia in order to control its vast oil reserves.
Still, the British and American abuses vis-à-vis Persia and Iran started earlier, lasted longer, and imposed far higher costs than Iran’s actions vis-à-vis the US and UK.
In fact, both sides fully honored the treaty, and it led to the landmark 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
No one at this point seriously believes that Iran is maintaining an active program to develop nuclear weapons, though not long ago it was almost conventional wisdom that the country was close to having them.
Just as conservative forces in Iran can be expected to try to stop an agreement, forces thriving on confrontation in the United States and elsewhere will do the same.
The United Nations Security Council has been split and ineffective, and even Russia seems to be gradually losing the leverage it once had in Damascus.
Despite all the criticism they faced, US President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State, John Kerry, stuck doggedly to the task of negotiating a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program.
“I ask you,” he said in 1963, “to stop and think for a moment what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands, in the hands of countries large and small, stable and unstable, responsible and irresponsible, scattered throughout the world.”
There is an important lesson to be learned from more than a decade of negotiation with Iran.
The talks collapsed: no compromise, no agreement.
In reality – and as the coming weeks, months, and years will demonstrate – major issues have yet to be settled.
In the meantime, there could easily be changes of heart and mind as those who negotiated the interim deal return home and face criticism from their governments and publics over its terms.
President Barack Obama must contend with a far more complex political environment, beginning with the US Congress.
Obama is right: A nuclear agreement of the sort outlined is preferable to Iran possessing nuclear weapons or going to war to prevent that outcome.
Indeed, it is legitimate to ask whether Western (and especially US) negotiators were aware of the geopolitical implications of the deal.
And, whether Israel benefits or loses, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is sure to come out ahead.
Emulating the French statesman Cardinal Richelieu, Kissinger helped the weaker power against the stronger one.
All of this may say something essential about Obama’s approach to the nuclear deal with Iran.
But I had seen how determined Rouhani was to reach an agreement.
Likewise, the heavy-water reactor at Arak will have to be redesigned to produce only radioisotopes for medicinal and industrial purposes, or for research into other peaceful uses of nuclear energy, with the spent fuel it produces shipped out of the country.
What is most needed – and most difficult to achieve – is a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
We must now run the rest of the race.
Sanctions alone could not have accomplished this, and using military force would have entailed considerable risk with uncertain results.
Even without violating the accord, Iran can position itself to break out of nuclear constraints when the agreement’s critical provisions expire.
And the US should push back as warranted against Iran’s foreign policy or treatment of its own people.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and US President Barack Obama would both benefit from a deal.
Far from harboring weapons of mass destruction, he was focused on maintaining his grip on power.
The upheaval in these two neighboring countries has reshaped regional geopolitics.
According to Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer, human-rights activist, and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, the restrictions are part of a government policy to limit women’s opportunities outside the home.
Atheists, agnostics, or members of Iran’s Bahai community are not accepted.
It seems that we still take sexual and religious discrimination less seriously than we take racial and ethnic discrimination.
Ironically, while Khamenei is no fan of democracy, he relies on the fact that his principal enemies are bound by democratic constraints.
But, from the perspective of Iran’s leadership, the taunting has tactical value to the extent that it reinforces the view among the Israeli public that Iran is a dangerous enemy, willing to retaliate fiercely.
In fact, it is far from certain that Iran will be able to withstand current sanctions-related pressures indefinitely.
Indeed, conditions in Iran’s oil industry had so deteriorated in 2007 that gasoline rationing was introduced, opening the way to a thriving black market.
Other Turkish investors express similar complaints. Cesur Ambalaj pulled out because of “unkept promises.”
According to the International Monetary Fund, the Iranian economy is almost totally controlled by political actors.
Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that doing business in Iran is a labyrinthine nightmare.
Iran’s choice for its next president, the hardline Mayor of Teheran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is likely to worsen relations with the West and the country’s international isolation.
Most worrisome of all, he is close to the two main groups that represent the most extreme elements in Iran: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij organization.
Sometimes individual Iranian officials may have acted on their own to order and coordinate specific operations; they will now feel freer to do so.
A more militant Iranian posture is likely to increase friction with Iraq, as well as inspire more anti-American violence there.
Following more than a year of deadlock, after negotiations in January 2011 led nowhere, this dialogue is for many the last chance to find a peaceful solution to a nearly decade-long conflict (in which I participated closely from 2006 to 2009 as the West’s main negotiator with Iran).
Second, Iran’s regional standing has been shaken by the wave of Arab revolts, especially in Syria – a decisive country, given its strategic relations with both Iran and Russia.
With Iran’s nuclear program advancing and political uncertainty looming over the region, Israel supports a military operation against Iran in 2012, before, in the words of Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, it crosses the “immunity zone,” beyond which intervention would be futile.
Everyone has good reason to sit down and talk.
Once that’s done, any nation – or even a sophisticated terrorist group – can do the rest.
Iran could easily do what Japan does – hold enrichment facilities in readiness to make a bomb without actually doing so.
We are left in a situation that layers paradox upon paradox.
WASHINGTON, DC – The decision of former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami not to seek the presidency again has revealed how muddled Iranian presidential politics now is.  In trying to sort out this muddle, the most important thing to keep in mind is not so much who will be elected, but what that choice will reveal�about the intentions of the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Mir Hossein Moussavi, a former prime minister, and Abdullah Nouri, a former interior minister, are also expected to enter the race.
In order to manage the economic crisis successfully, any president must not only shift economic policy, but also amass enough political power to be able to thwart the intervention of the Revolutionary Guards and other organizations in economic policy-making.
The next president may have room to adjust economic or social policies.
Mousavi was an important part of the revolutionary movement that overthrew the Shah in 1979.
Former President Khatami, meanwhile, is reviled by the fundamentalists and the top brass of the Revolutionary Guards, who repeatedly obstructed his reform agenda during his presidency.
And an easing of US-Iranian tensions over the next few months, even if unaccompanied by substantive advances in the relationship, could improve the prospect for a fairer, less manipulated election result.
Iran’s theocratic regime, immersed in a momentous struggle for survival against what it regards as an unholy alliance of Israel, the American “Great Satan,” and a surrounding Arab world that abhors its hegemonic ambitions, will not surrender its nuclear ambitions easily. Indeed, nuclear weapons appear to be the regime’s only real route to self-preservation.
Iran’s backward economy, a third of which is controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, is simply incapable of offering job opportunities to Iran’s growing cohorts of university graduates – the same segment of society that toppled the Shah.
An attack on Iran might, however, produce precisely the effect that Netanyahu seeks to avoid.
Once fully operational, these facilities will give Iran mastery of the entire nuclear fuel cycle.
When it asked to visit a suspect lab within the Parchin defense production plant, the Iranians stalled.
“The least we can do to face this danger is to let our enemies know that we can defend ourselves.”
With Iran continuing to shelter top al-Qaeda leaders, this raises an even graver threat: that terrorists get hold of nuclear weapons.
Ahmadinejad confirmed sensing a similar presence. “I felt it myself, too, that suddenly the atmosphere changed and for 27-28 minutes the leaders could not blink....They had their eyes and ears open for the message from the Islamic Republic,” he told Ayatollah Javadi-Amoli.
In recent weeks, Ahmadinejad’s aides have denied another rumor that he ordered his cabinet to write a pact of loyalty with the 12th Imam and throw it down a well near the holy city of Qom, where some believe the Imam is hiding.
The Ministry of Information and Security (MOIS), largely sidelined by former President Mohammed Khatami, has re-emerged as a powerful repressive force, using plain-clothes agents, allied with the paramilitary Bassij and non-government vigilantes, to crack down on potential opponents of the regime.
In talks with members of Iran’s policy community, I am continually astounded that they see resolving the nuclear conflict (or, indeed, other problems in which Iran has a stake) to be primarily the responsibility of the US, Europe, and other major powers, not of Iran.
It would also be helpful if Iran laid out its strategic vision for the region.
The willingness of major countries to accept Iran with a nuclear status similar to Japan depends on whether Iran not only refers to itself as a status-quo power – which it occasionally does – but whether it acts as such.
Iran’s Political Clerics
Accordingly, the seminary establishment was no longer a civil structure managing only religious affairs, but instead developed into a unified, ideological party serving the interests of the regime.
Iran’s current supreme ruler, Seyyed Ali Khamenei, whose religious degree was a focus of suspicion in the seminary and among the clerical elite, was not considered a jurist by merit.
As a result, despite Saddam’s fall, the Najaf seminary remains impotent.
They may also hope to shatter the unified EU/US position that now exists.
It was far more costly to get Hezbollah to serve Iran’s strategy.
For the Israeli coalition government headed by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, matters are relatively simple.
If Lebanon’s political forces and Nasrallah’s followers cannot get him to revert to a truce, Israel will bomb more targets, including Nasrallah’s offices in south Beirut.
But instead of establishing friendly relations with Iran based on this new reality, the United States has consistently sought to restore its domination, even providing massive diplomatic, financial, and military support to Saddam Hussein in his war against my country during the 1980’s.
It seeks to win the confidence of its neighbors and has remained within the confines of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Iran has always considered regional stability to be in the vital interest of its own security and development.
We cannot predict our fate, but we can be certain that security will only come through real solidarity and global partnership.
It does not believe that sanctions can bring about its collapse.
If not, these forces will work to undermine the state.
This regime cannot survive in the long term with a political crisis such as the one it now faces.
The cheated presidential candidates, both veterans of the revolution, instinctively thought of a replay of history.
What’s missing this time, however, is a charismatic leader comparable to Khomeini.
By identifying squarely with the military-security apparatus headed by Ahmadinejad, Khamenei has alienated an important segment of the ruling clerical elite.
For that reason, it is demonstrating a degree of fragility that is comparable to the Shah’s regime in the latter part of the 1970’s.
Tension between the president and the Supreme Leader is built into the Islamic Republic’s core.
Their struggle is visible, however, in their maneuvering inside other branches of government.
By contrast, the president has no serious say in foreign policy, which is under the Supreme Leader’s direct supervision.
It is widely believed that the president would like to reduce the clergy’s influence and increase the power of the Revolutionary Guards, his main source of institutional support.
America’s decision to target Iranian agents in Iraq who may be involved in supporting violent militias is but another sign of the massive influence Iran is exercising in that troubled country.
At another level, Iran’s rise, reinforced by its suspected bid for nuclear weapons threatens to awaken historical hostilities, between Sunnis and Shiites and between Persians and Arabs.
Nevertheless, Iran also feels the need for accommodation with its adversaries.
Iran’s regional foreign policy has not yet caught up with its new pre-eminence; it is making as many enemies as it is gaining friends, and it might squander the windfall gains that it made in the past three years.
So how will the Iranian people weigh their votes? To answer, one needs to understand the composition of the Iranian electorate.
No candidate can be elected president of Iran without significant support among younger voters.
They want Iran to succeed – and to be recognized for its success – in sports, arts, and education at an international level.
Former President Mohammad Khatami, who openly considered trying again for the office, would have been a strong candidate for young voters.
The divide between Iran and Saudi Arabia, the Middle East’s most prominent Shia and Sunni powers, respectively, has deep roots.
The mass conversion to Islam among Persians was the first step toward the establishment of the first caliphate, a political-religious state comprising all Muslim lands.
It is thus unfathomable that they would dictate to Arab countries in any capacity.
That is why King Salman is overseeing the greatest military acquisition and expansion program in Saudi Arabia’s history.
Various state and non-state actors have been trying to fill the void created by America’s newfound caution, with most of the latter dependent on the support of regional powers, and two in particular: Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Even barring escalation beyond the Middle East, significant economic dangers are also likely, given the region’s energy reserves and thus its importance to the global economy.
Acceding to it would merely ensure further escalation of the conflict with Iran, which will never completely abandon its nuclear technology and nuclear activities.
While commentators have charged that Britain capitulated to Iran and handed them a humiliating victory in obtaining the release of the 15 British Marines last week, it would appear that something more like the opposite is actually the case.
Some have speculated that it was a matter of freelancing by the IRGC’s command, or the navy, reacting to a local target of opportunity.
All of this does not mean that there are necessarily “radicals” and “moderates” within the clerical regime in Teheran.
On one level, that reaction is predictable.
Terrorists who have tasted success in Iraq will increasingly turn on others.
Doing so would require significant investment, which in turn would require international confidence in Iraq’s future stability.
Second, countries should support Iraq’s government, despite its shortcomings.
Still, there is a big difference between an Iraq that struggles and one that implodes; between an Iraq that contributes to global energy security rather than undermining it; between a civil war and a regional war.
For Japan nowadays, security policy must satisfy a trinity of criteria: "national interests," "alliance," and "international cooperation."
From that time on, Japan trod a lonely path that ended with its defeat in World War II.
It is in recognition of the possible consequences - a return of US isolationism, the emboldening of terrorists - that many countries sent and retain troops in Iraq. Indeed, Russia, France, and Germany, which confronted the US and Britain at the UN over the Iraq war, and the UN itself, which withdrew early in the occupation, are all now searching for a way to assist in Iraq's rehabilitation.
The foundation was to be a liberal, even post-modern constitution, complete with a guarantee of 25% of parliamentary seats for women. 
But in practice administrative rules are now being applied to exclude so-called “high-ranking” Ba’ath members from any form of government employment, and thousands are affected.
One Shia leader, Moqtada Sadr, also vehemently opposes federalism.
Last year he was wanted for murder. Now he wants recognition as a statesman, money, and, at least implicitly, Sistani’s and the SCIRI’s humiliation.
To be sure, in the early 1960’s, members of President John F. Kennedy’s administration intellectualized war and debated the merits of strategies, including counterinsurgency.
No one can visit Iraq and talk to Iraqis without coming away with the sense that ridding the world of Saddam Hussein was an important – even noble – accomplishment.
If only he were more democratically minded, or would reach out to the Sunni community – perhaps offering another ministerial portfolio – suicide bombings of Shia religious festivals by Sunni extremist would end.
BLOOMINGTON – Iraqis go to the polls on March 7 to elect a new Parliament for the second time under the country’s permanent constitution of 2006.
The message from Iran’s allies in Iraq, who control the de-Baathification process, is clear.
The prime minister then met with Iraq’s chief justice, following which the court’s decision was reversed.
Even the principal Kurdish parties are facing a challenge from an independent party, Goran, and are likely to incur some losses to it.
On one side stood people who understood how to operate in a democracy, attain power, and realize their ambitions. They learned to speak the language of democracy, gaining money and influence in the process and enlisting independent organizations to defend their rights and privileges.
My answer to all of these questions was “yes.”
Though conditions in Iraq today are drawing many young men toward violence, I am convinced that we need only to provide decent jobs and housing to save them.
Above all, the government must spare no effort in convincing poor Iraqis of the value of democracy and freedom, and how important the constitution is in realizing their aspirations for a better life.
Thus, a vast majority of the population were sure that a democratically elected government would serve their interests and eagerly participated at the polls.
At a time when democracy is spreading, they remain dictatorships.
After all, this is precisely what the radical Islamists have done by, for example, reversing the traditional Islamic opposition to suicide bombing.
January’s Palestinian elections were won by a relatively moderate leader because he was put forward by the ruling Fatah movement and Islamists boycotted the election.
Now they hope to become a factor in bringing about real change.
The employees of the state-owned enterprises still receive paychecks, even though about a third of their workplaces have been destroyed.
Despite the violence, commercial activity has also risen, because Iraqis are now free to import the equipment and goods they need to build homes, run stores, and operate trucking companies.
Iraqi statistics, which define unemployment more expansively, show rates in percent declining from the mid-twenties to the teens in the past two years.
They also identify good officers and those who are corrupt or participating in death squads or sectarian militias.
But the key question concerning the future of the country remains: will Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds will unite behind a functioning central authority?
Article 11 of the new constitution declares that “All that is not written in the exclusive powers of the federal authorities is in the authority of the regions.”
Moreover, the Kurds are the proverbial dog that hasn’t yet barked.
Some Shia may turn to militia leaders, Sunnis to insurgents, and Kurds to leaders demanding independence.
Half of them go to other parts of Iraq; the rest go abroad.
But what happens to them?
But do the Iraqis really have these three choices? Can anyone watching reports of the daily carnage in Iraq envision Iraqis going back?
This leaves the third possibility – that of resettlement.
American behavior and self-perceptions reveal the ease with which a civilized country can engage in large-scale killing of civilians without public discussion. In late October, the British medical journal Lancet published a study of civilian deaths in Iraq since the US-led invasion began.
Another New York Times story (November 12), citing “military officials,” dutifully reported that, “Since the assault began on Monday, about 600 rebels have been killed, along with 18 American and 5 Iraqi soldiers.”
While the cameras were rolling, a US marine turned to an unarmed and wounded Iraqi lying on the ground and murdered the man with gunshots to the head.
Airstrikes against the Islamic State might unseat the group’s fighters in critical areas; but, as things stand, troops will be needed to hold and govern liberated territory.
In the two years following the withdrawal of US troops, then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, like Diem four decades earlier, set about consolidating political power through patronage.
Instead, security experts should consider how best to manage the potential for violence among and within the various factions vying for local control.
After 42 years of dictatorship, Libya, like Iraq in 2003 after the fall of Saddam Hussein, needs more than wishful thinking to become a vibrant democracy.
Last July, the Council’s military leader, Abdul Fatah Younis al-Obeidi, was assassinated under ambiguous circumstances.
The first is major cities’ competing sense of entitlement to the fruits of the revolution: Misurata, where Qaddafi’s body was displayed; Tripoli, which hosted the liberation ceremony; and Zintan, which is holding Qaddafi’s son, Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, prisoner.
The collapse of authoritarian rule created a security vacuum with no functioning state apparatus, making Libya highly exposed to international influence, often in the service of corporate interests.
Their campaign has been more coordinated and intense than last time, with the aim of mobilizing the maximum number of supporters and ensuring a high turnout, which most commentators assume will assist the Yes side.
The European Central Bank has provided a monetary lifeline that has provided much needed liquidity within the financial system and helped the government to stem the crisis of confidence created by the banking collapse.
Opinion polls conducted in recent weeks indicate that the Yes side commands a strong majority of 62% to 23%, with 15% of the electorate undecided.
“The recent economic and financial upheavals,” he declared, “have thrown a glaring light on the shortcomings of the intellectual tools provided by mainstream economics and its key assumptions regarding the sustainability of self-regulating markets,” especially “largely unregulated global financial markets.”
This is particularly important today, when public discourse in democracies is relentlessly demotic and academic work is increasingly specialized.
But this role has atrophied with the rising expectation that they should be “normal,” representing their populations’ habits and tastes as closely as possible.
“It is the art of the possible.”
In March, having agreed on the fiscal treaty, the European Council turned its attention to reviving economic growth, which will be the key to long-term fiscal sustainability.
It would also mean stable European economies to which we can export.
Crucially, we are also a member of the second-largest currency area in the world.
We must stand together or fall together, because our economies are so interconnected.
The “No” campaign has been vigorous, comprising a motley crew of aging Marxists, anti-globalization protestors, traditional euroskeptics, and obsessive “sovereigntists.”
The percentage of “Don’t knows” remains high, at about 47%, so there is everything to play for in the campaign’s final days.
Their votes could prove crucial in a tight contest.
The prospect of a future of genetically modified athletes incites alarm throughout the sports world, accompanied by portrayals of such athletes as inhuman or some form of mutant. This is a misrepresentation of how gene transfer would alter humans, both therapeutically and non-therapeutically, should it ever be legalized.
As has been made clear from the ethical debates on stem-cell research, a global policy cannot easily be adopted or enforced, nor should it be.
Those who fear that gene doping heralds the “end of sports” should instead recognize this moment as an opportunity to ask critical and difficult questions about the effectiveness and validity of anti-doping tests.
The Magna Charta is the world’s most visible statement of principles for the promotion and protection of university autonomy.
Moreover, this is not an affront to economics.
Once teaching reduces, if not eliminates, the original competitive advantage associated with a piece of research, academics and their funders are forced to seek new sources of advantage by producing new knowledge.
In the case of the university, this means allowing access to knowledge to students who lack the intellectual, political, or financial resources that might have enabled them to produce it for themselves.
One ongoing project is the construction of a new parliament building in Kabul, a symbol of India’s desire to see representative institutions flourish. But it is no secret that India does not believe that Afghanistan is ready to dispense with the foreign forces that have been shoring up domestic peace.
Indians have every reason to be relieved. An Afghanistan without ISAF will be prey to the machinations of Pakistan’s notorious Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which created, trained, financed, and directed the Afghan Taliban in the 1990’s.
The bottom line for India remains the Afghan people’s right to decide their own destiny. It views the international community’s role as being to help Afghans accomplish that.
One conservative intellectual put it in almost Nietzschean terms: “Yes, two million people took to the street after the elections. But they were voters, not fighters.
The effects of the latest round of international sanctions on Iran are somewhat ambiguous: they have weakened the country, but they do not seem to have weakened Ahmadinejad.
American officials often underestimate this threat perception and deep suspicion of US intentions, but they are powerful factors in Iranian politics.
If the Istanbul talks go well, they could provide a road map for further negotiations, not only on the nuclear issue, but also on Afghanistan, the Middle East, and terrorism.
The problem was Britain’s failure in the late nineteenth century to take its economy to the next level.
Enterprise managers promoted from the shop floor were, it is said, second rate.
There is no shortage of new MBAs establishing start-ups or even going to work for auto companies.
In response to the collapse of demand in 1929, it erected high tariff walls.
Is America Healing Fast Enough?
The third and fourth positive factors relate to housing and the labor market.
So, not surprisingly, they have provoked excitement in some circles that the US may finally be poised to leave behind the depressing trio of unusually sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and high and growing inequality.
Recall that the Fed’s policy bet was that these “costs and risks,” to use Chairman Ben Bernanke’s phrase, would be more than offset by the improvement in the overall economic situation.
Is Azerbaijan Next?
But can such a scheme work in Azerbaijan? A “dress rehearsal” failed in October 2003, when the opposition, incapable of uniting around a single candidate to challenge Ilham in the presidential election, declared the results to have been falsified and called people into the streets.
The transfer of power from father to son took place peacefully, and Ilham’s administration has presided over completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline – to the annoyance of Russia and Armenia.
As Brzezinski added, “Of course, it is important for the political regime in Azerbaijan to be as stable and legitimate as possible.”
But will such restrictions work?
Moreover, these CEOs lost a lot in the crisis.
Corporate executives manage larger companies. Investors manage much larger sums of money.
Indeed, politicians, eager to look good in the eyes of angry voters, are often more interested in setting limits to total compensation than they are in designing the optimal form of compensation.
Debt investors, not the government, would have bailed out the banks, making the financial crisis substantially smaller, if it had occurred at all.
In that case, a recession can occur despite the central bank’s best efforts.
After all, the US went off the gold standard in 1933, and the Fed cut the discount rate to 1.5% in 1934, ending deflation (except for minor episodes); but the unemployment rate did not fall consistently below 15% until 1941 and the onset of World War II.
We are now in the late stages of the biggest real estate boom in US (or world) history, driven by frenzied market psychology.
The police officer who murdered Taseer apparently acted because the governor recently launched a campaign to repeal the law. From the standpoint of Pakistani religious extremists who have applauded the murder, that itself was an act of blasphemy.
It is assumed in such circumstances that the violence will be carried out by those who sympathize with the views of the person inciting hatred.  An example would be a mob attack on a member of a racial or religious group in direct response to a speech urging an assault on members of that group.
Yet those who admire his courage in struggling for freedom of expression ought to see to it that efforts to make blasphemy a crime, or to perpetuate it as a criminal offense, are afforded no legitimacy whatsoever.
Now, instead of waiting for Maliki to act, US forces appear poised to do the job themselves.
Sadr can simply hold back and wait the Americans out.
First, it sidelines Maliki, which means that he will be less damaged politically than if he were directly identified with US attacks on Iraqi Shi’a.
Is Capitalism Doomed?
Even in the US, state and local governments, and now the federal government, are cutting expenditure and reducing transfer payments.
Others will soon follow.
Recent popular demonstrations, from the Middle East to Israel to the UK, and rising popular anger in China – and soon enough in other advanced economies and emerging markets – are all driven by the same issues and tensions: growing inequality, poverty, unemployment, and hopelessness.
Alan Greenspan attained an almost iconic status as Governor of the Federal Reserve Board.
Perhaps another occurred in 1998, when the Fed lowered interest rates in the face of what appeared to be an impending global financial crisis.
Greenspan’s irresponsible support of that tax cut was critical to its passage.
Unemployment harms workers, while the lower interest rates needed to generate more jobs may lead to higher inflation, which especially harms those with nominal assets whose value is eroded.
At some point, America will awaken from its geopolitical slumber; there are already signs that it has opened one eye.
It won the battle of the comminiqué, but it may have lost 20 years of painstakingly accumulated goodwill, the result of efforts such as the ASEAN-China free-trade agreement, signed in November 2002.
The geopolitical opportunity implied by inclusion of the map has not been lost on America, which is why the US, somewhat unusually, has made another effort to ratify the Law of the Sea Convention.
So why not make similar overtures to other ASEAN states?
LONDON – Remember the G-2? America’s financial difficulties and foreign entanglements, together with China’s economic ascent, led many last year to envisage the emergence of a sort of global condominium between the two countries.
First, the weak and largely jobless economic recovery in America and Europe shines the spotlight on China’s surging exports and the non-tariff barriers confronted by would-be importers to China.
China’s clash with Google and US protests at cyber attacks on American targets remind the outside world, as well as America’s media and political elites, of the difference in values between the two countries.
Far more worrying is an issue that is yet to play out.
This change, however, is also creating anxieties about shifting power relations among states.
Almost alone among developing countries, China is aging extraordinarily fast.
Communist ideology is long gone, so the legitimacy of the ruling party depends on economic growth and ethnic Han nationalism.
China’s size and high rate of economic growth will almost certainly increase its relative strength vis-à-vis the US in the coming decades.
He all but guaranteed that China’s annual growth would remain above 8% in 2009.
Even if successful in the short run, the huge shift toward government spending will almost certainly lead to significantly slower growth rates a few years down the road.
The environmental degradation is obvious even to casual observers.
These social differences have little to do with the yuan-dollar exchange rate, although that matters, too.
Instead, those who argue that the Chinese economy is overheating cite the high rate of investment in plant and equipment and real estate, which reached 43% of GDP in 2004.
And yet any government has to watch that the investment is being made effectively.
They can overextend their finances, fall victim to promotions, invest carelessly in the wrong assets, and direct production into regions and activities on the basis of momentary excitement rather than calculation of economic fundamentals.
Is China’s Tibet Policy Bad for Business?
With nationalist sentiment aroused, few Chinese are asking why the violence occurred.
Activists cannot possibly take aim at all foreign businesses in China, so most firms are unlikely to be specifically targeted or suffer reputational damage.
Chinese spokesmen denounced this as a throwback to the days when America thought it could, and should, try to “contain” the People’s Republic.
Conversely, some of China’s most disturbing moves can be chalked up to exaggerated feelings of insecurity.
At the same time, China really is still a “poor” country in terms of per capita income.
Outsiders are increasingly convinced that China is a superpower, and that it needs to show that it can be a responsible one.
In Saudi Arabia, the state-owned China Railway Construction Corporation built the Al-Mashaaer Al-Mugadassah light-rail project to ease traffic pressure during the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.
Excruciatingly laborious “stakeholder” consultations – of the type that lasted nearly ten years to construct the World Bank-funded Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric power plant in Laos – are not required of Chinese aid.
For example, 750 Chinese workers were shipped to Indonesia, along with 630,000 tons of steel, to construct the five-kilometer Suramadu bridge linking Surabaya to Madura.
But reaching that goal requires a plan, and China must play its part in formulating it.
On one side stands Arvind Subramanian, from the Peterson Institute and the Center for Global Development.
Historically, poor regions of the world have often relied on what is called a “vent-for-surplus” model.
The problem for poor countries is that they are not producing the right kinds of goods.
And they have made little systematic use of explicit industrial policies that could act as a substitute for undervaluation.
So it should surprise no one that “containment” is coming to dominate Asian diplomatic discourse.
Everybody has benefited from these ties.
But, even according to the highest estimates, China’s military budget is only now about equal to that of Japan and, of course, much less than the combined military budgets of Japan, India, and Russia, all of which border China – not to mention Indonesia, South Korea, and a militarily modernizing Taiwan.
In 2011 we may begin to see whether those incentives lead China’s rulers to re-appraise their diplomatic conduct, which has left them with only the corrupt, basket case economies of Burma and North Korea as reliable friends in Asia.
Yet the region has inadequate opportunities for young people to find meaningful work.
Moreover, Iraq's possession of oil is a mixed blessing, because few oil-based economies have proven hospitable to liberal democracy.
But this will take time and patience - and it will need to be accompanied by policy changes on Iraq, Palestine-Israel, and the regional economy.
But getting there requires American policies that are consistent with the comprehensive approach that democratic transformation requires.
True, Syria and Iran are playing a major role in supporting Iraqi insurgents, and Syria is still encouraging the trafficking of jihadists and weapons across its borders with Iraq. But the idea that these activities can be halted at will is naïve.
In these cirumstances, neither Syria nor Iran seems capable of delivering anything but mayhem in Iraq.
Assad cannot turn his back on all of this.
In the United States, the debate has been fueled by the baseball player Barry Bonds’ march towards the all-time record for home runs in a career.
To those who say that this will give drug users an unfair advantage, Savulescu replies that now, without drugs, those with the best genes have an unfair advantage.
Moreover, I would argue that sport has no single “spirit.”
So, while Savulescu’s bold suggestion may reduce drug use, it will not end it.
Output collapsed and unemployment soared.
Yet I am reluctant to believe that things will turn out the same way this time.
A third difference is that the political preconditions for a cooperative response are better today.
Reintroducing the national currency in order to depreciate it, but leaving the euro value of other financial instruments untouched, would destroy balance sheets and wreak financial havoc.
But it is the precise policies on which European governments cooperate that will tell the tale.
The point at which credit risk becomes exchange-rate/redenomination risk is ambiguous.
That said, much can still go wrong.
The eurozone is still prone to bad equilibria as long as growth on its periphery remains weak.
LONDON – Evidence-based medicine, as David Sackett and his colleagues wrote in 1996, is “the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.”
This is problematic for two main reasons.
She also happens to be opposed to taking blue-colored pills.
The medical community must develop the science of shared decision-making, in which epidemiological evidence informs conversations about what matters to the patient and how best to achieve those goals.
But for how long? While reading the economic tea leaves is always risky, there are signs that we are at the cusp of a transition to a new regime in which the rules of the game will not be nearly as accommodating for export-led strategies. 
Neither the economics nor the politics of this pattern of current-account balances is sustainable, especially in a recessionary environment. 
So exporting will become an even tougher business.
What is moderately bad news at the moment will become terrible news only if economic distress in the advanced countries – especially the US – is allowed to morph into xenophobia and all-out protectionism; if large emerging markets such as China, India, and Brazil fail to realize that they have become too important to free ride on global economic governance; and if, as a consequence, others overreact by turning their back on the world economy and pursue autarkic policies.
[Thus,] GDP would be higher than otherwise by $120 billion in 2009 and $180 billion in 2010...,” and by $60 billion in 2011.
It follows that an additional stimulus package in 2010 would be another mistake...”
We are interested in what the multiplier is under more normal conditions, and when the unemployment rate is 10%.
He characterizes the stimulus bill as a two-year $600 billion increase in government purchases.
At the moment, the United States Treasury can borrow at a real interest rate of zero for five years – and shove the entire five-year inflation risk onto the lender.
First, France has found it difficult to adjust to the demands of globalization.
In France, by contrast, the statist tradition – which, as Tocqueville so aptly observed, harks back to the Ancien Régime, and which is equally shared today by both the Gaullist and socialist ideologies – is strongly linked to a marked distaste toward the strictures of economic liberalism.
Whether it is the breakup of public monopolies, such as electricity, gas, telecommunications, and even the post office, or the replacement of military conscription by a professional military, or pension reform, France has changed much more than is commonly believed.
But the details of the treaty offer little comfort to a region that is still recovering from the economic devastation wrought by those wars.
At the same time, the agreement eliminates most import tariffs for commodities like rice, yellow corn, or dairy products.
So why did Central America's leaders sign the agreement? The region's economies have not experienced significant growth in the past five years (nor have they grown more than 5% annually in the past 20 years).
What lies ahead is uncertain; the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean stressed that CAFTA's implementation will add 0.5 percentage points to the rate of annual GDP growth in the region.
For contemporary democrats, the fullest possible respect for the autonomous individual is, as Thomas Jefferson put it, "self-evident."
Beyond fundamental freedoms and economic prosperity, do we have a specific civilization to defend?
To do so, there cannot be too wide a gap between our stated principles and our actual behavior.
In France, the debate has stalled altogether due to bitter distributive conflicts, deep division within the Left, and the Right's absence of an economic and social vision.
Individual buying of gold goes far beyond the airport shops and other places where gold coins are sold.
The dollar price of gold does not increase with the US price level.
And, if the price level should fall, a newly issued TIPS bond will return the original nominal purchase price, thus providing a hedge against deflation.
And gold is a liquid asset that provides diversification in a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and real estate.
Two weeks later, on May 31, Blair and Brown met in a small restaurant in North London, and debated who should take over the party leadership.
As a result, Britain has had an unprecedented decade of low inflation and relatively high economic growth, outperforming many of its European counterparts.
His reputation for command and control of the economy is magisterial and unchallenged, but he has given almost no clue as to what he thinks of other government policies.
All of them concentrated on domestic policies; none dared discuss Iraq, because they all know that to do so would raise the question of withdrawal, which in turn would unleash a major and possibly explosive debate about Britain’s relationship with the US.
But, despite the grim parallel, Japan’s government does not seem to think that it needs to take the problem seriously.
In other words, the private sector’s huge savings financed the government’s deficit, so that capital flight never occurred in the way it has in Greece, despite the desperate budget situation.
After averting its eyes since coming to power, Japan’s new government has finally started discussing tax hikes.
What is needed most now is for the DPJ government to restore comprehensive economic management.
WASHINGTON, DC – The geography of poverty and social deprivation has changed dramatically over the last two decades.
Moreover, income growth has contributed to improved education. Adult literacy rates in South Asia match the global norm.
The dowry tradition puts pressure on girls’ families to marry them early, leading to a preference for sons – and thus to sex-specific abortions targeting female fetuses.
In today’s uncertain world, social turmoil, gender deprivation, and rising conflict have tested countries’ abilities to create jobs, promote gender equity, equip young people with skills, and design effective social protection programs.
Two facts stand out.
This emphasis on anti-worker, pro-rich policies as the recession’s primary cause fits less well with events in Europe.
Continental Europe did not deregulate as much, and preferred to seek growth in greater economic integration.
The alternative view suggests different remedies.
Europe may be better off with stop-gap measures.
CAMBRIDGE – Inflation is now low in every industrial country, and the combination of high unemployment and slow GDP growth removes the usual sources of upward pressure on prices.
In past decades, large expansions of bank reserves caused lending surges that increased the money supply and fueled inflationary spending growth.
The long-term unemployed will be much slower to be hired as the economy recovers than those who have been out of work for a much shorter period of time.
The large number of long-term unemployed may make the problem more difficult this time by causing the unemployment rate to remain high even when product markets are beginning to experience rising inflation.
Over-levered households cannot spend, over-levered banks cannot lend, and over-levered governments cannot stimulate.
Consider, next, whether the inflationary cure would work as advertised.
So central banks would have to regain anti-inflation credibility very soon after subjecting investors to a punishing inflation.
No solution is without weaknesses, though.
If the world’s central banks raise interest rates while the major problem is insufficient global demand, they might cause a depression.
The European Central Bank’s response has been analogous to the Fed’s, but less forceful, with monetary policy easier than the headline inflation rate would suggest is appropriate.
Global rebalancing is painful for American consumers, and shows itself as higher headline inflation. But to respond by fighting inflation inside the US would be grossly inappropriate – both much more painful for US consumers and pointless.
But this overlooks what ought to be at the center of the discussion: higher US unemployment right now is not an appropriate goal for stabilizing US output and offers few benefits, if any, for stabilizing US prices.
But, as matters turned out, their absence did not hinder the parties from reaching an agreement.
As hosts of the conference, the Ghanaians were particularly incensed at being asked to make an arrest under such circumstances, and refused to do so.
Just a week before the indictment, seven African Union and UN peacekeepers were killed and 22 injured during an ambush by well-armed militiamen.
Can politics learn from history?
The surprise of Bush’s new policy is its shift of political focus from Iraq to its two immediate neighbors.
The nuclear program is the dynamic factor here, because it will set a timeline for action.
So why the current threats against Iran?
WASHINGTON, DC – The Obama administration’s decision to withdraw the bulk of United Sates troops from Iraq over the next 19 months has sparked fears that Iraq will once again plunge into the wide-scale and debilitating violence that it endured from 2004 to 2007.
The ethnic cleansing of many Baghdad neighborhoods in 2006 and 2007 was deplorable.
Jordanian agents were instrumental in providing the intelligence that enabled US forces to kill Abu Zarqawi, the mastermind of the Amman bombing.
NEW YORK -- Israel’s decision in May to drop commandoes onto a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists was brutal.
So is it true, as many defenders of Israel claim, that the Jewish state is judged by different standards from other countries? I believe that it is.
They don’t know any better.
The French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut was right to criticize the Erdogan for over-reacting to the raid on the “Gaza freedom flotilla.”
Allowing the past to cloud our critical faculties undermines Israeli democracy, and will have further dangerous consequences in the future.
In normal times, however, there is no such premium at all.
The reason is that healthy spending and production no longer depend only on the soundness of the banking system and public confidence in its stability.
So central banks must also focus on how the fall in the volume of money flowing through financial markets will affect spending, and on how much they should cut interest rates and expand money supply to offset these effects.
Agriculture remains the main source of income for more than 30% of China’s labor force, compared to less than 2% in the United States or 6% in South Korea.
This is bad news for reducing income inequality, as capital gains and high-end wages may grow much faster.
But that will happen only if the other countries’ wages are relatively more efficient (i.e., productivity there is ultimately higher than in China), and not just because Chinese nominal wages go up. For now, however, this does not seem to be the case in general.
MEXICO CITY – Shortly before America’s elections last November, then vice-presidential candidate Joseph Biden was widely criticized for predicting that an Obama administration would almost certainly be tested by what he called a “generated” international crisis, in much the way that the Soviet Union “tested” John F. Kennedy shortly after he assumed office.
That disguised coup failed – barely – and there is no guarantee that the result will be similar this time around in Mexico.
It is emblematic that while Obama has received Mexican President Felipe Calderón, the White House only recently announced that one of his first foreign trips would be to Mexico.
Four factors, none of them new but each destabilizing on its own, are compounding one another: lack of hope, dangerous governmental policies, a regional power vacuum, and the absence of active external mediation.
Iran, whose influence in the Levant is not so much the cause of unresolved problems in the Middle East as the result of them, continues to defy the imposition of new sanctions by the United Nations Security Council.
Qatar over-estimates its own strength.
Domestic issues are likely to preoccupy Obama and his team at least up until the mid-term elections this November, thus precluding active diplomacy during the critical months ahead.
There will be times when nations – acting individually or in concert – will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.”
By the 1990’s, such conflicts were the dominant form.
The same is true of today’s fourth generation of modern warfare, which focuses on the enemy’s society and political will to fight.
Markets and economic power rest upon political frameworks: in chaotic conditions of great political uncertainty, markets fail.
Neo-conservatism has served as a badge of unity for those in the Bush administration advocating an aggressive foreign policy, massive military spending, disdain for international law and institutions, an assault on the welfare state, and a return to “traditional values.”
For future neo-conservatives, however, the 1960’s produced a “trauma” that transcended the humiliation of a lost war and the disgrace of Richard Nixon.
The question was how to package elites’ interest in free-market capitalism with the provincial temperament of a parochial constituency.
Employing a crude form of “realism,” which has traditionally viewed the state as the basic unit of political analysis, neo-conservatives portrayed al-Qaeda in terms of familiar enemies, namely fascism and communism, with backing from “rogue” states that must not be “appeased.”
BAGHDAD – The Obama administration’s Iraq policy is in chaos. Seven months after Iraq’s national elections, the United States has publicly denied taking sides in the wrangling over who will be prime minister.
First among these is Syria. Post-election Iraq was an obvious opening for the US to place a wedge between Iran and Syria.
First, they are weary of renewed Iranian attempts to destabilize Iraq.
The Bush administration insisted that Iraq achieve various “milestones” – elections for which the country was not ready and completing a constitution in six weeks, to name two – simply to create the appearance of substantive achievements ahead of the 2004 presidential election or the 2006 mid-term elections.
Flores, a Social Christian candidate representing a rightist alliance, wants to maintain present President Alejandro Toledo’s neo-liberal policies, which have boosted economic growth, foreign investment, and exports spectacularly over the past four years.
But Humala's detractors claim he took up arms to help the escape of Montesinos, who was already wanted by the law, but managed to flee aboard a sailboat towards Galapagos on the day of the coup.
Humala glorifies two Peruvian military dictators: Cáceres, who fought against Chile, and Velasco Alvarado, who nationalized oil and mining companies, redistributed land, and controlled the press.
But that is precisely the point: so many of the men caught up in sex-tinged scandals of late have exposed themselves – sometimes literally – through their own willing embrace of text messages, Twitter, and other indiscreet media.
The neural circuitry is identical to that for other addictive triggers, such as gambling or cocaine.
By now, there is an effective and detailed model for weaning porn-addicted men and restoring them to a more balanced mental state, one less at the mercy of their compulsions.
How plausible is this argument? Can benign regulation really be bought?
The industry’s voice was more often heard in Parliament as well.
The data are not from financial firms alone, and Tahoun has not disaggregated them by sector.
The Fed folk are paid a little better, and stay rather longer.
So intellectual capture is a charge hard to refute. But were regulators surrogate lobbyists for the financial industry?
So both countries maintained their claims to sovereignty.
Japan faces parliamentary elections in the near future, by August 2013 at the latest, but perhaps as early as the start of the year.
Although China surpassed Japan as the world’s second-largest economy two years ago, Japan is a comfortable society with a much higher per capita income.
MOSCOW – Has Russia’s economic crisis ended? That depends on who you ask.
But there you can read very pessimistic estimates of the country’s economic future.
But Russia’s budget for 2010 is still headed for a serious deficit, owing to high spending.
Whereas inward investment reached $20 billion in 2008, capital outflows totaled $20 billion in 2009.
The state, which is seeking to rescue the domestic automobile industry, allocated to the firm more credits through state-owned banks.
But, as former United States National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft noted, Russia still “has enormous capacities to influence the US security strategy in any country.”
So Russia’s claim to being a central element in Eurasian security, on par with the US and the European Union, is not the blustering of a spent Leviathan. Rather, it is a demand for a fair international legal order.
America’s global military power is undisputed, although it is used with decreasing frequency.
For many years, we had to deal with the problem of Russia’s very existence rather than that of the quality of its governance.
Writing in the fifth century b.c., Hippocrates provided the first known definition of melancholia (what we now call “depression”) as a distinct disorder: “If fear or sadness last for a long time it is melancholia.”
All conditions that display five or more of nine symptoms – including low mood, lack of pleasure, sleep and appetite difficulties, inability to concentrate, and fatigue – over a two-week period are now considered depressive disorders.
Parents whose child is seriously ill, spouses who discover their partners’ extramarital affairs, or workers unexpectedly fired from valued jobs are defined as suffering mental disorders if they develop enough symptoms to meet the DSM criteria. This is so even if the symptoms disappear as soon as the child recovers, the spouses reconcile, or a new job is found.
SEOUL – South Korea’s recent economic performance has been disappointing.
But fiscal policies often targeted unproductive projects, such as rural infrastructure construction, and weaknesses in the banking system dampened the effectiveness of monetary stimulus.
On the contrary, GDP contracted by 0.1% last year, and is expected to grow by just 0.6% this year.
Over the same period, South Korea’s share of global exports jumped from 0.3% to 3% – very close to Japan’s 3.6%.
It also should continue to implement structural reforms aimed at strengthening its labor and financial markets, improving institutional quality, and boosting productivity in services and small and medium-size enterprises.
While these factors undoubtedly placed upward pressure on food prices, they alone cannot explain the steep hikes.
But their presence has also raised concerns that speculation in commodity futures could result in higher price volatility.
For each study that finds a significant connection between speculative trading and market volatility, there is at least one that claims the contrary.
Moreover, such a fund would require exorbitant resources to be operational, not to mention the tremendous challenges in determining a price level that would trigger its intervention.
If actual output is below potential output, this means that total spending is insufficient to buy what the economy can produce.
So a stimulus will boost both output and employment.
Some of it will be saved. American household saving has shot up from 0% to 5% since the start of the recession, understandably to pay off debt.
This is intended to stimulate private spending by bringing down the rate of interest at which banks lend to their customers.
A double round of stimulus packages is needed to counteract the real prospect of a double-dip recession.
Today, as protests mount and multiply, the government of every Arab state in the Middle East and North Africa probably believes that, if left to its own devices, it can contain internal dissent.
Lifting the state of emergency that has been in force since 1963 – giving sweeping powers to the regime and its security services – would be both a symbolic and tangible step in the right direction.
The regime claims that it is part of the 'resistance' with its senior partner Iran.
What the Syrian people want is a meaningful dialogue with the regime.
Bank shares in particular are rebounding, and some banks have even succeeded in repaying at least part of their government-provided capital.
The prices of structured securities such as collateralized debt obligations have come down, because the institutional fraud of a multi-fold chain of securitizations has been detected.
Hansen predicted that capitalism would suffer from a permanent underinvestment crisis. Banks would scale down their balance sheets in proportion to their reported equity losses and exacerbate the credit crunch from which the world is already suffering today.
If government becomes a partner, it may well endow the banks immediately with the equity required to sustain their business.
That is why the prize has invited comparisons to an Oscar lifetime achievement award that comes only when the recipient is nearing death.
A similar study, conducted in 2012 by Javier Santiso, a professor at the ESADE business school in Barcelona and a managing director at Telefónica, found that Europe’s per capita investment in venture capital in 2011 was a meager $7, compared to $142 in Israel and $72 in the US.
Member states’ governments and the European Commission’s last communication, “A Stronger European Industry for Growth and Economic Recovery,” display an awareness of the need to revive Europe’s industrial policy.
The question was, which political community would support the euro?
After all, that piecemeal approach is what had helped to build the EU ever since its origins in the coal and steel community of the 1950’s.
Now, however, what did not happen through smooth evolution has started to happen through crisis.
In spite of their desire not to raise them, European leaders face the uncomfortable prospect of having to answer them – and without much delay.
To bring the cost of those goods and services down to the level in the US would require the euro to fall relative to the dollar by about 15%, to around $1.10.
Because German exports are attractive to foreign buyers at the existing exchange rate, Germany in 2009 was the world’s second largest exporter (after China).
While much of that investment will flow to the US, the surplus countries want to diversify their investment of these new net export earnings.
These and other countries with very large foreign-exchange balances are beginning to diversify their holdings from dollars to euros, a process that will continue and that will inevitably cause the euro to rise relative to the dollar.
Because of his close relationship with Prime Minister Thatcher, I also had several opportunities to meet with her.
While some restrictions on banks will be imposed in the wake of the financial crisis, we will not see a return to severe regulatory constraints on banks’ activities.
Although the top rate of income tax in Britain was recently raised to 50%, there is no thought of going back to pre-Thatcher taxes. 
But the dramatic policy changes in the US and Britain under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher brought about such profound improvements that there is no going back.
Thus was born the Spence Commission on Growth and Development, a star-studded group of policymakers – including another Nobelist – whose final report was issued at the end of May.    
It starts with strong preconceptions about the nature of the problem: too much (or too little) government regulation, too poor governance, too little public spending on health and education, and so on.
It has no “big ideas” of its own, and at times it tries too hard to please everyone and cover all possible angles.
Yet there is more to the question than extreme cases of moral breakdown.
Palestinians are the only people of whom a majority sees less equality for people of different racial or ethnic groups, although opinion is relatively evenly divided in Nigeria, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Russia.
In Iran, the figures were 82% and 78%, respectively. 
Words do have consequences, and what one generation says but does not really believe, the next generation may believe, and even act upon.
Many Ukrainians now hear domestic echoes of the lead-up to war in Georgia.
Many member states will worry about leaping straight to the contentious issue of ultimate membership for Ukraine, but the EU already recognizes Ukraine’s theoretical right to join once it has met the Copenhagen criteria; and it cannot be beyond EU leaders’ verbal dexterity to play up the prospect.
The decision to appoint Ukraine and Poland as co-hosts was a powerful symbol of European unity across the current EU border (Poland is a member, Ukraine is not).
Thus, the effort to contain and destroy the Islamic State has become yet another referendum on President Barack Obama's stewardship of US foreign policy.
Beyond subjugating those in the caliphate, exterminating the Shia, and gaining custodianship of Islam's holy cities in Saudi Arabia, the Islamic State ultimately embraces an apocalyptic vision, to be realized through a sectarian totalitarianism that embodies divine revelation – and thus envisions no compromise or competition.
That is what has caused his detractors to question his patriotism, a political capital offense in many countries, and nowhere more so than in America.
Unless that changes, the US will lack the strength needed to prevail over such singular threats as the Islamic State.
Indeed, though the Middle East is facing an abundance of challenges to its stability, none is as large, dangerous, and immediate as the Islamic State.
Lower oil prices help, and there are only so many banks to rob.
In Iraq, there is some evidence that its momentum has been halted; but the growing role of Iran and the Shia militias it backs all but guarantees that many Iraqi Sunnis will come to sympathize with or even support the Islamic State, whatever their misgivings.
Under such a scenario, IS would remain less a problem to be solved and more a situation to be managed.
What has happened since shows clearly what everyone knew (or should have known) all along: nothing about regime change is simple.
While oil has made a few presidents and princes staggeringly rich, the rest of the population has received little benefit.
It is no accident that religious reform in Scandinavia, Germany, England, the Netherlands, and the United States gave rise to today’s global capitalism.
But the grim reality for the Islamic world is that, in times of widespread uncertainty, the forces of tradition tend to speak more loudly and clearly than those of change.
After three decades of spectacular economic growth, many Malays have become prosperous and content not only through secular capitalism, but through the country’s renewed sense of Islamic identity, one which – for the most part – embraced modernization.
This culminated in poor electoral results for the ruling coalition in November 1999.
This trend continues. One of Badawi’s first acts after taking over as prime minister in October 2003 was to introduce the concept of Islam Hadhari.
By making Islamists and Islamist sentiments a part of the process of modernization, Malaysia demonstrates that Islamic faith and economic growth can be reconciled if politicians are clever enough not to treat them as contradictions.
Islamic radicals enjoy enough support to be a serious threat in their part of the world. It is important to understand how this happened.
Qutb was executed by the Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1966 as part of a brutal but unsuccessful attempt to eliminate the Muslim Brotherhood.
Sheik Dia al-Shakarchi, a leading Shi’ite theologian, argues that democracy is not only compatible with Islam, but is essential to it.
Indeed, in my view, democracy is not only permitted by Islam, but can be regarded as a religious rule.
Of course, the problem of Islam’s compatibility with democracy may be analyzed from different points of view.
Such a dictatorship would damage Islam by associating Islam with unjust rule and creating enemies for Islam.
Islam\u0027s Electoral Divide
But electoral competitiveness is always a necessary condition for democracy - and therefore a central consideration when evaluating a country's prospects for democratization.
By contrast, none of the 16 Arab Muslim-majority countries is an overachiever.
It makes intuitive sense that Islam cannot by itself explain such differences.
Anyone even remotely familiar with the region knows how common is the phrase "the Arab nation" ( watan ).
Multiculturalism in Britain has entrenched almost self-contained Muslim communities and turned Islam into a badge of identity to counteract exclusion.
In a way, their rebellion is the hallmark of their Britishness or Frenchness.
In Britain, too, immigrants have been changing the ethnic profile of the middle and professional classes.
Reform Judaism in Germany resulted in religious and cultural particularism yielding to a far greater degree of universalism than was envisaged at any time in the Jewish past.
The belief that the other’s religion is not Islam, and its followers not Muslim, has underpinned internecine wars in which millions have died – and continue to die.
But because we Muslims like to add qualifications that often derive from sources other than the Koran, our religion’s unity has been broken.
Today’s oppression, the killings and the humiliations of Muslims, occurs because we are weak, unlike the Muslims of the past.
Muslim scholars added to the body of knowledge and developed new disciplines, such as astronomy, geography, and new branches of mathematics. They introduced numerals, enabling simple and limitless calculations.
Many Muslims continue to ignore this and, instead, merely pray to Allah to save us, to bring back our lost glory.
Far beyond Koranic recitation, these men aspired to participate in the centuries-long discussions among Muslim scholars about the proper ordering of Muslim life.
Both conservative traditionalists and radical fundamentalists were drawn to political activism and came to regard the modern state as a means to liberate Muslims from foreign domination and to re-Islamicize society through a revival of Islam's original norms.
Adapting Islam to modern conditions was the purpose of the first generation of reformers.
This may partly reflect the Muslim community's understandable fears that associating Islam with terrorism and violence would contribute to an increase in attacks on, or discrimination against, all Muslims.
Moreover, because it is obvious to everyone that most violent extremism is being carried out in the name of Islam, avoiding the word is unlikely to prevent attacks on Muslims in response to this violence.
I am not sufficiently expert in the Islamic tradition to be confident that extremists are misinterpreting it, and few of us are.
By now, the problem with trying to counter those who seek new recruits for “violent extremism" without focusing on this extremism's Islamic basis should be clear.
Success will require a clear understanding of the roots of this ruthless network of jihadists.
By promoting the core vision of a jihad to defend the lands of Islam (Dar al-Islam) from outsiders, the CIA produced a hardened fighting force of thousands of young men displaced from their homes and stoked for battle.
Such operations have failed – repeatedly and frequently disastrously – to produce legitimate governments or even rudimentary stability.
Finally, the long-term solution to regional instability lies in sustainable development.
In short, it is a matter of meaningfulness, the presence of which motivates us, connects us to one another, and orders our lives.
If they fail, as we have seen, others will fill the void, potentially with a call for mayhem in the name of messianic futurity.
The meaning and vitality of life in a democracy cannot be allowed to fade.
On the other hand, the Islamic State has released 15 hostages, including citizens of Italy, France, Switzerland, Denmark, and Spain.
This time France stood firm, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying that to retreat one inch would be to hand victory to the militants.
Ransoming one Western hostage creates an incentive for militants to capture another.
As he watched the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s, Sigmund Freud described the dangerous appeal of authoritarian leaders and the satisfying self-aggrandizement that their followers experience when they subsume their personalities in an ideology or group.
Such symptoms and syndromes cannot be understood in purely economic terms, if only because they are as prevalent among the middle class as they are among the poor.
Feel the happiness we are feeling.”
On the one hand, Article 3 states that Islam is the religion of the federation, and that only Islam can be preached to Muslims.
Likewise, the defense by Malaysian civil reform movements of individuals’ freedom of conscience has been denounced by some religious leaders as an attack on Islam.
All attempts to reduce Malay influence serve to mobilize this community – in both ethnic and religious terms.
Many Muslims are wary of this brand of identity politics.
Both historically compensated for their isolation with strong central governments, powerful navies, dynamic entrepreneurship, vibrant culture, and imperial ambition.
Even the world’s great universities, from Harvard to Oxford, are seeing fewer Japanese students.
Isolationism, whether in Japan or the UK, is not only a short-sighted choice; especially for Japan, it may also be a perilous one, given the rise of China next door.
That is because both countries’ latest rush to affirm their sovereignty over the islands – called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese – reflects a sense of insecurity and a perception that the other side is taking an aggressive stand, which means that the issue is unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future.
Both sides urgently need to cool off, especially in order to contain their extremist elements and prevent them from taking over the issue and setting the policy agenda.
In the long run, the best outcome is a peaceful resolution to the sovereignty issue, or, barring that, a compromise that satisfies both sides’ core interests.
And inward-looking policies in Russia and Turkey, driven largely by their leaders’ egos, are unlikely to produce anything but harm.
In an interdependent world, isolation is no longer a source of pride; on the contrary, it is a cause for concern.
Such policy may be brutally effective in the short term; in the long term, it is certain to be costly for Turkey.
Today, the key confrontation in this power struggle is Syria’s civil war, where all of the region’s major players are represented either directly or indirectly, because that is where the battle for regional hegemony will largely be decided.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah party will be unable to offer much opposition – all the more so in view of Hamas’s break with Iran (despite ongoing arms deliveries) a year ago.
Paradoxically, the position of Hamas fits the political right in Israel, because it, too, puts little stock in a two-state solution. And neither the Israeli left (of which little remains) nor Fatah is strong enough to maintain the two-state option.
The question of what to do about Iran’s nuclear program will also return with a vengeance in January, after US President Barack Obama’s second inauguration and Israel’s general election, and will demand an answer within a few months.
The UN’s Human Rights Council would not have dared to put Russia in the dock for razing Grozny, Chechnya’s capital, or China for brutally suppressing the people of Tibet and the Muslim Uighur minority.
The indifference of some European countries towards Israel’s call for help during the debate over the Goldstone report was not unrelated to their frustration at Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s refusal to freeze the settlements, as Obama has been insisting.
Arguably, the war in Gaza created a new kind of mutual deterrence in this war-torn region.
Nor is it clear that membership would be in the best interest of Israel, a country whose defense doctrine has been always based on self-reliance and freedom of maneuver in security matters.
The Dialogue was not exactly an edifying success, however.

In fact, the agreement is unlikely to survive 89-year-old Peres and 77-year-old Abbas, who are now presidents of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, respectively.
While killings have declined sharply in recent years, hardly a day passes without some form of violence, often against civilians – including children.
As a result, without a clear agreement on borders, Area C will witness the most serious confrontations.
The symbolic decision on statehood, followed by Abbas’s exit, will mark the end of the process that began in Oslo, and that has been undermining Palestinian aspirations for nearly two decades.
There is no other example of a nation that returned after a 2,000-year absence to a territory that it never stopped regarding as its homeland.
Indeed, never before has the question of legitimacy been so fundamental to a conflict between nations.
The idea of a bi-national Israeli-Palestinian state embodies the dangerous illusion that two peoples who are utterly different in their language, religion, culture, and history, who are divided by a deep economic chasm and connected to their own external worlds – the Palestinians to the Arab world and Israelis to the rest of world Jewry – can be combined in the framework of a single state.
PARIS – The world has recently seen a rapid succession of efforts to delegitimize Israel.
BDS is supposedly a worldwide civil-society movement embodying respect for law, democracy, and human rights.
One has only to read the declarations of Omar Barghouti, Ali Abunimah, and other promoters of the BDS movement to see that this solution is precisely what they do not want.
As do debates.
This includes making sure that people who carry out attacks, and those who aid and abet their crimes, are lawfully punished.
It mounted a demonstrably disproportionate response, killing a large number of noncombatants, including hundreds of children, and destroying thousands of homes and commercial enterprises.
That, rather than slaking the public’s thirst for vengeance, should be their primary objective.
In the 2009 election, the Kadima party, under his successor, Tzipi Livni, received one seat more than Likud, but was unable to form a government coalition. Netanyahu did, and went on to win the 2013 election.
He conducted a campaign that relied on his eloquence and charisma, as well as on scare tactics.
The arguments for and against joining the government are well known.
But the celebration is likely to be short.
Obviously, some groups have long recognized the need for sterner measures. Most notably, in 2005 Palestinians living in the diaspora and others launched the international boycotts, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement, with the goal of compelling Israel to stop violating international law, particularly with its settlement policies.
TEL AVIV – Forty-five years into Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories, and four years after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s government became the undertaker of the two-state solution, an electoral campaign run in utter denial of Israel’s Palestinian conundrum has just ended with yet another Netanyahu government in office.
Demographers warn that the Jewish and Arab populations between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean will reach parity this year.
To make his point, Lapid even launched his electoral campaign in Ariel, an Israeli city built in the heartland of the Palestinian West bank.
These parties made no effort to reach out to the new regimes and the rising new generations in the public squares of the Arab world.
Nineteen other countries (or regions of countries) – mostly in Europe and North and South America – now allow gay couples to marry legally.
Another major figure in the group is Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate who donates millions of dollars to Republican politicians who most actively support Israel.
You are letting them murder us, literally.”
The ad shows the extent to which the language of human rights has become politicized.
They tear societies apart, destroy the livelihoods of millions, and cause even greater conflicts, as we have seen in Iraq.
Yet re-elect him they did.
But to his constituents, emulating the racist politics of Europe’s far right was a legitimate exhortation to turn out.
Whether motivated by tribal animosities, an ideological rejection of the peace process, or cultural estrangement from Israel’s liberal elites, anyone who feels alienated – ethnically, culturally, or socially – joined Netanyahu to defeat those on the left who had usurped Jewish history and betrayed Eretz Israel.
Until last summer, Netanyahu appeared politically unassailable.
When Yair Lapid – the ambitious but inept finance minister, who leads the centrist Yesh Atid party – proposed waiving the value-added tax on first apartment purchases by young couples, Netanyahu failed to respond decisively, giving the impression that he lacked control over his own cabinet.
Even Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman, head of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, is now criticizing Netanyahu for alienating the US and has suggested that he would not rule out joining a centrist government.
Such a shift would reinvigorate hope among Israelis – and not a moment too soon.
Now Palestinians have turned to knives. On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the last man to have embodied a real hope for peace, is a third intifada erupting?
And who on the Palestinian side would be willing, much less able, to engage in serious negotiations with Israel’s increasingly right-wing government? There are too many rifts and weaknesses on one side, and too powerful an illusion of strength on the other, for talks to yield anything of value.
But the proposal, though certainly appealing, is not consistent with the realities of the Middle East today. Unlike European countries, which emerged from World War II so exhausted by conflict that they agreed to pool their sovereignty for the sake of peace, the countries of the Middle East are experiencing an ever-intensifying climate of nationalism, intolerance, and hatred.
Both the left and the right have been proven wrong.
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni’s Kadima party, opposition leader Binyamin Netanyahu’s Likud party, and Defense Minister Ehud Barak’s Labor party all fall – with only secondary variations – within a centrist consensus, which also reflects a popular national consensus.

Israel’s Dangerous Political System
But the most important cause, the one that should be addressed before all others because it is eroding Israel’s very viability, is the near paralysis of the political system.
This systematic miscalculation can be explained as follows. From the 2006 war in Lebanon to the recent deadly raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla, Israeli leaders have badly appreciated the ratio between military gains and political risks, and the necessary proportionality between the two.
There will come a moment when Israel’s actions will incite people – not only the most fanatical of the country’s foes, but also the most generously inclined of its supporters – to question Israel’s essence.
Even the fact that some of the “humanitarian aid workers” turned on the soldiers with a rather un-peaceful array of knives and clubs is no justification for shooting to kill.
Israel’s current leaders, and a segment of Israeli society, are trapped in an idiosyncratic logic of fear and self-centeredness.
Moderate Israeli citizens, who had nothing to do with the flotilla fiasco, should lower their heads in shame for their government’s act.
All this is now bound to change. It is inconceivable, for example, that an Egyptian democracy, in which the Muslim Brotherhood would be a legitimate political force, would persist in Mubarak’s complicity with Israel’s siege of Hamas-controlled Gaza.
Nor is Egypt’s political discourse likely to be especially palatable to Israelis.
This is blatantly obvious in its failure to respond creatively to the Arab world’s democratic upsurge.
PARIS – It is difficult not to be struck by the contrast between the “Asian”-like energy of Israel’s economy and civil society and the purely defensive nature of its approach to political change, both within and outside the country.
But why not dream of a new strategic triangle comprising Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, just as Israelis once dreamed of a non-Arab triangle between Israel, Turkey, and the Shah’s Iran? The Turks’ appalled reaction to the Syrian regime’s brutal behavior creates an opportunity that Israel should use to try to restore the privileged relationship with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government that existed before the Gaza blockade.
The gap between Israel’s rich and poor nowadays may recall Brazil, but who remembers the original Zionists’ social-democratic ideals?
They also sustained, against all odds, a democracy that, however imperfect and dysfunctional, is nonetheless amazingly vibrant.
By contrast, “Jerusalem” regards “Tel Aviv’s” drive for “normalcy” as a shallow affair, one that is almost criminally indifferent to Jewish memory and the lessons of Jewish history.
It has been a sadly recurrent condition of the Arab-Israeli conflict that no war lost by a humiliated Arab side has ever ushered in a peace settlement, just as no war overwhelmingly won by Israel has ever led its leaders to be magnanimous in victory.
But those who breathed a sigh of relief at the weakening of Netanyahu’s Likud and the country’s extreme right-wing parties should be as anxious as ever.
Either way, the country no longer resonates with the expectations, hopes, and fears of a world still focused (ever more dimly) on resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Israel has become post-modern, producing new – and sometimes startling – synergies among its avant-garde high-tech sensibility, its secular and ever more orthodox religious identities, and its overall ethno-nationalist outlook.
The new government’s fragile equilibrium only reinforces this sober interpretation.
Since Kadima and Labor will not have a majority even as coalition partners, they will have to bring in some of these groups.
The Oslo agreement in 1993 and the ensuing peace process embodied that expectation.
Finally, with the USSR gone and the United States the world’s sole superpower, the geostrategic situation had changed entirely.
They have merely concluded that politics will not bring miracles, and that the most they can expect is to keep external threats to a minimum.
These questions are important, because “fatalism” has become a major obstacle that must be overcome by anyone seriously interested in bringing peace to the region.
A majority of Israelis are even more convinced today than they were yesterday that they can count only on themselves and, at the margin, on the Jewish Diaspora.
On the other hand, there is great comfort in the status quo .
This raises the question of whether Israel’s repeated refrain that “all options are on the table” implies that even a nuclear strike is possible. Israel’s nuclear history provides no clear answer, but the future may force the issue.
As Iraq moved to complete the Osirak reactor by the early 1980’s, Israel applied diplomatic pressure and actions against foreign nuclear vendors, sabotaged atomic exports, and assassinated Iraqi scientists, before finally settling on the June 1981 air strike on the plant.
Given its efforts to fend off an attack, Iran represents a far more difficult target for Israel than Iraq and Syria did.
In the months before and after, it continued to hold war games and practice air strikes on Iran.
Given Iran’s placement of strategic sites in or near population centers, the deaths of many thousands of people would forever tar Israel.
Stop with the ‘pinpoint assassinations’ and look into the civilians’ eyes on the other side as well.”
How can Israel’s preferred Palestinian leaders, Abbas and PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, be left with any credible capacity to negotiate if talks cannot begin until, as Israel insists, they retreat on their minimum condition of a settlement freeze in the Occupied Territories?
It makes clear both that full UN membership remains to be determined and that final-status issues like borders, refugees, Jerusalem, and security all remain to be negotiated.
Israeli politics is undergoing its most dramatic changes in 30 years.
The former, as in Labor, believed that some day a force would emerge among Arabs and Palestinians ready to make peace on a reasonable basis; the latter, as in Likud, were more doubtful.
Sharon now needs to institutionalize his reforms, even if he now needs to establish another party to do so.
Sharon might decide on partial withdrawals and dismantling of settlements on the West Bank.
The Observer State of Palestine
More and more Palestinians, fed up with the futility of what is still called the “peace process,” believe that Fatah’s fierce rival, Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules Gaza, has more effective ways to break the current impasse.
On the contrary, shared hardship usually strengthens the ties between citizens and their rulers.
Israeli policies are not genocidal, as some commentators, not always free from anti-Semitic animus, like to claim.
PARIS – The war in Iraq – which led in 2003 to the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime – had one clear winner: Iran.
The answer, of course, is no.
One may disagree with this Euro-centric interpretation, but what is clear is that the Muslim Middle East will be too preoccupied with internecine struggle to worry about the Palestinians or the existence of Israel.
Nor does it mean that Israel can do whatever it wants, whenever and wherever it wants.
Israeli leaders must adjust their long-term strategic thinking to the new Middle East that ultimately emerges from the current disarray.
His Belgian colleague, Filip Dewinter, represents a Flemish nationalist party tainted by wartime collaboration with the Nazis.
Instead, he found eager supporters among pious Protestants, for whom Jews belonged in their own holy land rather than in Europe.
Contrary to what the Nobel Prize-winning author José Saramago once said, the Israeli army’s attacks in Gaza are not comparable in any way to Auschwitz.
If the Israelis, or the Palestinians, are like Nazis, then the horror of what the real Nazis did has been greatly diminished.
Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud Party and the even harder right Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel is Our Home) party achieved a dominant result that saw Labor, the dominant party throughout Israel’s history, consigned to a lowly fourth place.
It follows two controversial wars (although the current nominees were not directly involved in the 2006 war with Hezbollah).
This challenge has become more interesting with European countries’ willingness to deal with a united Palestinian government that includes Hamas’ Hanieh.
जलवायु परिवर्तन का समाधान

Italy and Spain offered credible fiscal and growth-oriented reforms, and the European Central Bank, with Germany’s backing, promised intervention as needed to stabilize the banking sector and sovereign-debt markets.
External investors may not be rushing for the exits, but they are not piling in, either.
Monti attempted to address this, but moving from the current equilibrium to a better one, in which tax evasion is the exception rather than the norm, is a long-term project.
Obviously, in the context of the eurozone, this is not an option.
In the eurozone, for the most part, national governments separately choose investment levels in infrastructure, education, research, and technology.
Italy’s Return to Political Paralysis
This may seem strange, given the antagonism between Romano Prodi and Silvio Berlusconi during the electoral campaign.
The new government will face formidable challenges.
As if this was not enough, Prodi will face another problem.
As a result, Italy will soon return to its older tradition of short-lived governments and unstable coalitions.
With 11,500 students, that is more than $1.5 million per student (not including the university’s buildings and art collection, each worth many billions of dollars more).
Can his consistent performance really be attributed to luck?
There seems to be a pattern.
But, in fact, he has done consistently well in both the short term and the long term.
And he is certainly not a defeatist.
In the 1970s, the economist Rudi Dornbusch (and reality) taught us that that was wrong: a floating-rate regime capitalizes expected future differences in nominal interest rates minus inflation rates into today’s exchange rate.
Moreover, Europe lacks the governance institutions needed to choose the easiest path to manage economic rebalancing: moderate inflation in the north, rather than grinding deflation and universal bankruptcy in the south.
Rather than see the 30% euro appreciation that would follow from the ECB’s current monetary policy, German exporters would scream for measures to prevent America’s “competitive devaluation,” finally bringing about moderate inflation in the north rather than the current grinding depression in the south.
For many, the true marvel of the digital age is its creation of a parallel universe.
The “Internet of Things” is connecting simple household items – like a thermostat – to the Web, helping owners to save money and even reduce their carbon emissions.
Who is speaking out for them? Most households stand to gain from the continuation of the ICT revolution.
But back in 1993 there was one exception – one senior Republican officeholder and policy intellectual who did not forget his policy commitments of earlier years: US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
The six problems that confronted me and others when we arrived in Washington in 1993 have not been solved. The long-run fiscal situation remains discouraging, if not as dire as we feared it would become.
On one side, there are warnings that robots will displace humans in the economy, destroying livelihoods, especially for low-skill workers.
Globalization hurt lower-skill workers in places like the United States, as it enabled people from faraway countries to compete for the leg-and-finger positions in the global division of labor.
Computers mean that higher-skill workers – and the lower-skill workers who remain to oversee the large robotic factories and warehouses – can spend their time on more valuable activities, assisted by computers that demand little.
What really matters is whether the jobs outside of the robot-computer economy – jobs involving people’s mouths, smiles, and minds – remain valuable and in high demand.
And they saw an economy growing considerably faster than North Atlantic economies had when they possessed the same absolute and relative economy-wide productivity levels.
Its economy-wide relative productivity level has since declined, with two decades of malaise eliminating the pressures to upgrade in agriculture, distribution, and other services.
Thus, the Japanese economy’s potential annual growth rate slowed by roughly an additional two percentage points at the beginning of the 1990’s, as the post-WWII development model lost its steam.
BERKELEY – Before 2008, I taught my students that the United States was a flexible economy.
What we have seen since 2008 is that Japan is not an exception.
Others blame a global investment shortfall driven by a lack of technological opportunities.
WARSAW – Over the past 60 years, the project of European integration has confronted many challenges: post-war economic hardships, the heavy yoke of communism, and the uncertain footing of the post-Cold War world.
European industry is afflicted by similar problems.
This approach is a colossal waste of money.
And, after six decades of meddling, EU policymakers should step back and consider which restrictions have become harmful or irrelevant, and how better to support the entrepreneurs and industries of the future.
Most of the other half are not doing badly, either.
While we do not know what might have happened were policies different, one can easily imagine that, absent quantitative easing in the United States, Europe, and Japan, those economies would have been mired in a deflationary post-crisis landscape akin to that of the 1930s.
As Rodrigo Vergara, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, observed in his prepared remarks at Jackson Hole, large currency depreciations in many emerging markets (most notably some oil and commodity producers) since the spring of 2013 have been associated with a rise in inflationary pressures in the face of wider output gaps.
Next month, when jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo receives the Nobel Peace Prize, attention will be drawn away from the more encouraging aspects of what China’s leaders like to call their country’s “rise,” and toward their persistent mistreatment of its most outspoken citizens.
His three-year-old son was lucky to recover quickly after he and 300,000 other children fell ill after drinking the adulterated milk in 2008.
After all, the same Chinese leaders who reject Liu’s calls for political reform argue that what Chinese citizens really want are not “Western-style” rights, but basic necessities – clean water, economic opportunities, safe food – that allow their families to prosper, and which China’s own homegrown political system can adequately protect.
Kill and Let Die
Later, he championed the drone-strike strategy that he has used to “kill bad guys” without charge or trial.
So was al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, who was deliberately killed by a drone strike two weeks later.
The book No Easy Day, written by a team member, is a bestseller.
America’s violation of domestic and international law – and the bodies of innocents mown down by drones or operatives – are all too real.
According to this view, if markets do not fully internalize all of the costs of private action – environmental pollution is a classic example – some “optimal” tax or subsidy supposedly can correct the problem.
On this issue, Buchanan was, unfortunately, prescient –&#160;and well before financial crisis and deep recession led to yet another jump in the size and scope of government, accompanied by large deficits and exploding debt in the United States, Europe, and Japan.
But the gap between textbook solutions drawn up in universities and think tanks and the reality on the ground can be vast.
The success rate was so poor (a tiny percentage of participants got targeted jobs) that the Labor Department’s Inspector General recommended shutting it down – and this at a time of massive unemployment, with firms listing millions of job openings but unable to find workers with the required skills.


Unfortunately, their lofty rhetoric often rings hollow.
With a few keystrokes, small companies selling Polish antiques, traditional Bavarian costumes, and Spanish shoes have burst out of their home markets and reached consumers around the globe.
A growing volume of trade is conducted in bits and bytes that flow over the Internet.
Such regulation, it is argued, would facilitate the emergence of European Internet platforms and guarantee “open access” to users.
Indeed, letting the Internet blossom not only makes good business sense; it might also help to restore voters’ waning faith in the European project.
Big banks’ boards are supine for three main reasons.
And, five years after the largest financial crisis in almost 80 years, one can count the number of properly qualified board members – across all megabanks – on the fingers of one hand.
Instead, regulators stand idly by while bank boards remain self-perpetuating clubs, with membership regarded as little more than so much social plumage.
NEW YORK – With Russian troops occupying Ukrainian territory and the Chinese Navy inhabiting Philippine territorial waters in the South China Sea, the world is now entering a dangerous time warp.
Now, however, with China rising, global power rebalancing, and the US worn down by two decade-long wars that have eroded its credibility, the postwar international order is under intense strain.
The EU’s twenty-first-century dream now confronts the nineteenth-century Czarist bear, flashing its atavistic claws on the Russia-Ukraine border.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, growing ever stronger, is acting with impunity.
First, we must focus on the four million civilians trapped inside Syria and cut off from aid.
This would make a huge difference, especially when coordinated with aid packages that are delivered to border crossings.
Erdoğan and the Paradox of Populism
Rather, populism is a thoroughly moralized conception of politics, and a populist is a politician who claims that he or she – and only he or she – truly represents the people, thus relegating all political opponents to the role of iniquitous pretenders.
It is often said that populists cannot govern, or will be exposed as incompetent, when elected to office.
If only one party truly represents the people, why should the state not become the instrument of the people? And when populists have an opportunity to write a new constitution, why should they not ride roughshod over any opposition, which, by definition, must comprise the enemies of the people (who often are accused of being foreign agents)?
Unfortunately, the moves against Golden Dawn are mostly identified with the government’s interests, rather than being perceived as the result of careful, independent judgment.
But a ban might not have halted the German people’s general disenchantment with liberal democracy, and an authoritarian regime still might have followed.
But parties that seek to exclude or subordinate a part of “the people” – for example, legal immigrants and their descendants – are violating core democratic principles.
Nor is it always the case that mainstream parties can cut off support for extremists by selectively coopting their complaints and demands.
Economic integration is a hot topic in the region.
To hope for a unified currency in Asia seems almost like hoping for the region’s own Greek crisis.
To answer this question, US and Japanese policymakers should rely on the “calculus of participation,” which dictates that the first step in choosing whether to join an international initiative or regime is to consider the last step in the process: the outcome.
As it stands, the misallocation of capital and poor investment decisions in China raise serious risks, which increasingly seem to be on par with those in the US that triggered the 2008 financial crisis.
It may be, as some Japanese colleagues tell me, that newly elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, despite his deeply conservative nationalist background and instincts, is ultimately a realist who will do what it takes – no doubt with the help of pressure from the United States – to defuse these tensions.
In 2007, his national security adviser told a colleague of mine, “All of this is the work of Korean leftists: there’s nothing to it.”
It is possible to argue – as many Japanese do – that much of the negative reaction by Japan’s neighbors has been driven by cynical nationalist considerations.
Leadership of that quality has been a long time coming in Japan.
At the start of Koizumi’s government, 8.4% of bank loans in Japan were non-performing.
Despite the parlous fiscal position, for now the market for Japanese government bonds (JGBs) remains stable.
And new demands for fiscal expenditures are expected to grow as the country ages.
But Kan still seems unwilling to focus on growth.
Now, thanks to bad policies, and even worse politicians, it ranks among the world’s also-rans.
That is why Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made constitutional reform a high priority.
Amendments require a two-thirds majority in both chambers of the Diet, and a majority in a popular referendum, making Japan’s constitution one of the world’s most difficult to revise.
Even if Abe manages to relax the amendment requirements – no easy feat, given the likelihood that a popular referendum would reveal weak public support – he will probably have to leave the change to his successor.
Indeed, we now not only have the authority to act, but a clear and definitive message from the electorate that we must do so.
But we also need to enable and encourage more Japanese women to participate in the workforce, whether at the beginning of their careers, or after choosing to have and raise children.
But we also know that the political space that we have secured is too precious to be squandered.
That is the oath I will be making as I assume leadership of Japan for the coming electoral term.
The power of generosity can be disarming.
Words similar to those he used to address the subject of America’s war dead would demonstrate that Japan does not intend to rewrite history, and that Abe feels repentant toward not only its US ally, but also its neighbors in Asia.
In doing so, they turned an unbalanced global economy into the Petri dish of the greatest experiment in the modern history of economic policy.
Despite the abject failure of Japan’s approach, the rest of the world remains committed to using monetary policy to cure structural ailments.
What central banks cannot achieve with traditional tools can now be accomplished through the circuitous channels of wealth effects in asset markets or with the competitive edge gained from currency depreciation.
Unsurprisingly, the wealth effects of monetary easing worked largely for the wealthy, among whom the bulk of equity holdings are concentrated.
In the meantime, politicians are lulled into a false sense of complacency that undermines their incentive to confront the structural challenges they face.
And the financial markets' most likely reaction will be a simple yawn.
Indeed, if current trends persist, the debt held neither by the BOJ nor other government-related entities could be down to 65% of GDP by 2017.
The Japanese authorities are thus doing what former US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke proposed in 2003 – using monetized fiscal deficits to put spending power directly into the hands of companies and households.
Japan was already one the world's richest countries in 1990, and its per capita income has continued to grow, albeit slowly.
The reason is clear: Abe is determined to pass a set of national security bills allowing a reinterpretation of Japan’s constitution that enables the country to play a greater role not only in enhancing its own security, but also in advancing world peace.
Japan became the world’s second-ranking industrial power, and almost all Japanese enjoyed lifestyles and levels of social security that their parents could never have imagined.
In the decades since, both the Soviet government and the Russian government of President Boris Yeltsin periodically engaged in diplomatic efforts to end their country’s estrangement from Japan.
These initiatives reflect Japan’s recognition that the global framework that has kept the peace, and created opportunities for prosperity, for ever more countries – including China – is under threat.
At the same time, the ancient sense of cultural superiority that runs in Chinese veins makes feelings of inferiority hard to bear.
So how should Japan respond? Should Japan fight fire with fire?
This attitude contributed to inattention by Japan's political, administrative, academic, and media elite toward China's unlawful advance toward Japanese territories and neighboring waters, including Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
But, ultimately, the effectiveness - and hence the success - of such a strategy will depend on how Japan positions itself in the region, especially in the relationship with China.
Kan became finance minister after his predecessor Hirohisa Fujii suddenly resigned, citing ill health.
But now that his party is in power and must face the reality of running the second largest economy in the world, and coping with its huge debt burden, he is tossing aside his long-held views, broaching the subject of tax increases to help close the government’s gaping budget deficit.
Japan ’s consumption tax (essentially the same as VAT in Europe) was introduced in 1989 at a rate of 3%, and increased to 5% in 1997, after heated political battles.
What is needed, and badly, is a nonpartisan body to find a sustainable way to pay for the country’s social security programs.
By virtually any measure, official Japanese debt is the highest in the world.
But, given Japan’s aging population, how long can that continue?
The government must not overestimate how much revenue can be gained by the consumption-tax increase, and thus how much of the budget hole can be closed. Moreover, it has so far shrugged off any concern that the tax increase might have a chilling effect on consumption, and thus on economic growth.
The unity with which the Japanese population met last year’s disaster demonstrated once again that, when called upon, the national spirit can work miracles.
Indeed, domestic politicking seems to be at least as important to Japan’s leaders as to South Koreas’s or China’s.
Fixated on the promise of an ever growing Chinese market, they give little thought to the stability of the region.
Far from endorsing Japanese lack of sensitivity, active Western political engagement – for its own credibility in Asia – must convey that Japan’s future depends on gaining the trust of the region.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan has been elected President of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), surviving a challenge from Ichiro Ozawa, the DPJ’s most potent behind-the-scenes power broker.
That increase would enable Treasury mandarins to maintain their latitude in setting fiscal policy, while making it unnecessary to streamline special-account budget financing for gargantuan public corporations, into which retiring bureaucrats parachute for lucrative jobs.
Kan’s status quo approach to alliance management won’t hold up long, because Hatoyama’s bungling has inflated Okinawans’ expectations about evicting the Marines. The current governor will likely block any construction to relocate a base on the island, exercising a de facto veto, particularly with the gubernatorial election due in late November.
Appeasing Ozawa, however, is contrary to public sentiment and detrimental to the DPJ’s hopes of regaining popular support.
This reflected a ‘feudal’ like corporatist approach, in which the direct relationship between the citizen and the state played no role.
Lowering the prestige of the government right now is the fact that Kan has not shown any talent for turning himself into a TV personality who can project a grand image of leadership.
A half-century of reporting on internal LDP rivalries unrelated to actual policy has turned Japan’s reporters into the world’s greatest connoisseurs of political factionalism. It has also left them almost incapable of recognizing actual policy initiatives when they see them.
But the risks that seaside reactors like Fukushima face from natural disasters are well known.
Because reactors located inland put serious strain on local freshwater resources – including greater damage to plant life and fish – water-stressed countries that are not landlocked try to find suitable seashore sites.
France likes to showcase its nuclear power industry, which supplies 78% of the country’s electricity.
While the appeal of nuclear power has declined considerably in the West, it has grown among the so-called “nuclear newcomers,” which brings with it new challenges, including concerns about proliferation of nuclear weapons.
But, despite its recent poor performance, Japan retains impressive power resources.
Japan also became the world’s largest creditor and largest donor of foreign aid.
Moreover, its culture (both traditional and popular), overseas development assistance, and support of international institutions provide resources for soft, or attractive, power.
For example, China has blocked Japan’s efforts to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Even South Korean newspapers have been full of praise for the self-discipline of ordinary Japanese in dire circumstances.
An important aspect of culture is the use of language.
But it might also lead to necessary changes.
But it was this system that produced the problems now associated with TEPCO.
PARIS – Forget what you have heard about the hard-working Japanese salaryman: since the early 1990’s, the Japanese have drastically slackened their work habits.
Japan’s powerful bureaucrats, nostalgic for the 1960’s model of development, whereby government and its business cronies nurtured the Japanese miracle, strongly opposed this bold, free-market solution.
Have the Japanese people opted for it?
Hatoyama’s talk about a “new age,” which sounds strange from a Western perspective, is in harmony with the Japanese way: this is a country where thousands of cult leaders offer myriad paths to Happiness, in particular a glib mishmash of New Age and Zen Buddhism.
Hard questions are not to be asked, and straightforward answers are considered too rude and crude to be given.
Those were the days of sharply rising incomes, when Japanese households could increase their consumption rapidly while adding significant amounts to their savings.
The combination of low household saving and substantial government dissaving would normally force a country to borrow from the rest of the world.
With a debt-to-GDP ratio of 200%, the higher interest rate would eventually raise the government’s interest bill by about 4% of GDP.
The result in Japan would then be rising real interest rates as the low private saving rate runs head-on into large fiscal deficits.
Together with other factions, Tanaka commanded a majority within the LDP and remained the party’s kingmaker and string-puller in successive LDP governments, perfecting the LDP’s quasi-social-democratic combination of export-led growth and pork-barrel wealth redistribution.
Unsurprisingly, as Koizumi’s reforms stalled, and as LDP governments under Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe, Yasuo Fukuda, and Taro Aso ran adrift, Ozawa-proposed wealth redistribution captured the hearts and minds not only of rural voters, but also of city dwellers displeased at the fraying social-safety net.
In Japan’s season of political discontent, it seems that there is nothing new under the sun.
And yet, visitors to Tokyo today see prosperity everywhere.
Old people have retreated to villages, many growing their own food, their children having long abandoned them for the cities.
Unfortunately, as well as Japan has held up until now, it still faces profound challenges.
Investors who have bet against Japan in the past have been badly burned, grossly underestimating the Japanese people’s remarkable flexibility and resilience.
They also want to stop Abe from dismantling and privatizing one of their central fiefdoms, the Social Security Agency. In this struggle, the mandarins are aligning themselves with the DPJ, at least to the general public’s eye, because it has proposed merging the Social Security Agency with the National Tax Agency, a move that would ensure government jobs for the former’s employees.
Koizumi had real successes in these reform efforts, which significantly transformed a malfunctioning Japanese state that was in the grip of pork-barrel LDP politicians, bureaucrats, and big business elites.
The DPJ, now temporarily aligned with low-profile bureaucrats behind the scene, can now either obstruct any bill in the Upper House that is sponsored by Abe’s administration, thereby cornering him into dissolving the Lower House, or they can engage in meticulous deliberations in the Diet in the hope of demonstrating to the electorate their fitness to govern.
But, rather like the election of the first black president of the United States, it was fizzing with popular expectations, promising a fundamental shift from the past.
Japan’s one-party state, under the conservative LDP, was a product of World War II and the Cold War.
Japanese governments could devote their energy to building up the country’s industrial wealth, while the US took care of security, and by extension much of Japan’s foreign policy.
But it is a very different world from the one left in ruins in 1945.
If the US is as serious about promoting freedom abroad as it claims, it should not be hindering one of its closest ally’s efforts to strengthen its democracy.
Although there have been numerous initiatives to investigate its war guilt, especially its occupation of China, there has not yet been an official effort comparable to what the Germans undertook to take collective responsibility for their war crimes.
The damaged bilateral relationship has only made China’s desire for a “peaceful rise” more uncertain.
जापान ऐतिहासिक दृष्टि से दुनिया के मामलों में अपनी क्षमता से अधिक ऊँचे मुकाम पर पहुँचा है। उन्नीसवीं सदी के उत्तरार्ध में, जापान एशिया की पहली आधुनिक आर्थिक सफलता की कहानी बन गया है। मांचू-शासित चीन और तानाशाही वाले रूस को दो अलग-अलग युद्धों में हरा देने के बाद यह एशिया की पहली आधुनिक वैश्विक सैन्य शक्ति बन गया है। द्वितीय विश्व युद्ध में करारी हार होने और संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका द्वारा कब्ज़ा कर लिए जाने के बाद भी, जापान भारी आर्थिक सफलताएँ हासिल करने में कामयाब रहा, और 1980 के दशक तक यह वैश्विक औद्योगिक शक्ति का केंद्र बन गया था, एशिया ने इससे पहले ऐसा कभी कुछ नहीं देखा था।
अधिक आत्मविश्वासी और सुरक्षित जापान से निश्चित रूप से अमेरिका के हित ही परवान चढ़ेंगे जो स्वयं अपनी सुरक्षा और क्षेत्रीय शांति दोनों के लिए और अधिक जिम्मेदारी ले सकेगा। प्यू सर्वेक्षण में 47% उत्तरदाताओं ने एशियाई सुरक्षा में जापान की अधिक सक्रिय भूमिका का समर्थन किया है जिससे पता चलता है कि अमेरिकी लोग इस बात को अच्छी तरह से समझने लग गए हैं।
The question is whether Abenomics 2.0 will put Japan’s economy back on the path to renewed prosperity.
When I first started asking my Japanese academic friends about Abe’s supply-side reforms, they said, “Don’t worry, they’re coming.”
But the big picture remains: Abenomics so far has failed to turn around a deflationary mindset.
Postponing the second consumption-tax increase seems like a good compromise between pushing Abenomics to escape velocity and maintaining long-run credibility.
Japan’s opposition parties offered no convincing alternative to the Abe government’s policies.
But three other actors also played important roles in securing Abe’s victory.
The current problem facing Abenomics, as it aims to save Japan’s economy from deflation, is that wage hikes have not kept pace with the April 2014 consumption-tax increase (from 5% to 8%) or the rise in import prices associated with a weaker yen.
America’s Bickering Asian Allies
Intelligence sharing is a case in point.
The timing could not be better, as rising security fears are altering public perceptions.
Boosting technical interoperability also will take considerable time, though both countries maintain sophisticated defense forces with great potential to be linked together.
Japan is once again saddled with a caretaker government as the ruling Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) scrambles for a new leader with an election to the lower house of the Diet looming. The question is: who or what has been careless?
The LDP and the DPJ are now debating how to manage rising inflation at a time of falling living standards and deepening economic polarization within society – the latter a legacy of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi’s market-oriented reforms of 2001-2006.
His charisma dissipated public resistance, as his battle cry – “Demolish the LDP” – seemed to promise that politicians would also pay a price for change.
Should the DPJ gain a plurality and forge a coalition with the country’s far-left parties, the outcome would be ceaseless instability.
Given this recognition and remorse, we Japanese have believed for decades that we must do all that we can to contribute to Asia’s development.
Today, the US and Japan recognize that they must continue to take the lead in fostering a rules-based international economic order – fair, dynamic, and sustainable – within which all countries can flourish, free from the arbitrary intentions of any national government.
Twenty years ago, I myself opposed opening Japan’s agricultural market.
In short, Japan is in the midst of a far-reaching transition to a more open future.
Adding these partners to the central pillar of the US-Japan alliance will strengthen stability throughout the region.
Once these legal changes – the most sweeping in our post-war history – are in place by this summer, Japan will be better able to provide a seamless response for all levels of crisis.
TOKYO – Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was on a six-day tour of Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine, when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) posted a video online threatening to murder two Japanese hostages, Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, if his government did not pay $200 million within 72 hours.
And, to some extent, their expectation was met; some opposition members of Japan’s Diet tweeted that Abe should cancel the promised aid.
Only three hostages and one Israeli commando – Yonatan Netanyahu, the elder brother of current Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu – were killed in the operation.
Fortunately, Abe – whose efforts to rescue Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea fueled his political rise – seems to recognize the need for change.
But the one thing about which everyone seems to agree is the theoretically and empirically unjustified assumption that an equilibrium exchange rate actually exists.
At the end of the 1980’s, some analysts thought rates as high as 120 might finally produce the long-sought equilibrium.
While an appreciating currency might eventually drive labor-intensive manufacturers out of business, if Japan’s economic history is any guide, they are likely to be replaced by producers of things like ships, machine tools, semiconductors, and doubtless new products yet to be invented.
How did Asia’s boom fade so quickly? Economics is supposedly a cold-blooded subject.
Reckless lending is undermining efficient allocation of capital and preventing China from drawing a line under the investment- and export-led growth model of the past three decades and basing future growth more on domestic consumption.
Elsewhere in Asia, including in China, the debate is only beginning.
Instead, today’s poorly regulated financial sectors – China is the biggest culprit – misprice capital.
In some ways, the bilateral relationship is already moving in a positive direction, especially on the economic front.
All of this highlights a fundamental flaw in China’s external strategy: its efforts to use its increasingly powerful military to intimidate its neighbors come at the expense of its own long-term security.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe echoed this sentiment, declaring that Japan will play a larger role in safeguarding regional security, including by providing patrol ships, training, and military surveillance equipment to countries engaged in territorial disputes with China.
Wang’s visit thus is coming at a time of fundamental redefinition of Sino-Indian relations.
The US and NATO would prefer to avoid an abrupt and complete withdrawal – a preference that Afghanistan’s neighbors share, fearing that any resulting disorder would spill over their borders.
Although India has been a functioning democracy for almost seven decades, its government remains plagued by corruption and inefficiency.
Interestingly, India’s election commission has introduced a “none of the above” option to the ballot for this election, following a ruling by the Supreme Court last year.
But the Americans are intent on withdrawal, and no other country is willing to assume the responsibilities that they are relinquishing.
Meanwhile, India has been attempting to counter-balance Pakistan’s influence with the Taliban by providing investment, military training, aid, and other support to the Afghan government.
But back in 2001, Iran’s government, led by reformist President Mohammad Khatami, essentially consented to the US invasion of Afghanistan, even providing discreet assistance.
Nearby Russia is increasingly a one-man-show under President Vladimir Putin, who seems intent on refighting the Cold War with the US, rather than constructing viable strategic relationships that reflect Russia’s diminished reality.
TOKYO – A country’s foreign policy is supposed to be aimed, first and foremost, at advancing its national interest.
The current dispute in the East China Sea over the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands (the Diaoyu Islands in China) would likely be less tense if the atrocities of the Sino-Japanese War were not rehashed so often in contemporary Chinese life.
East Asia, in particular, has experienced an unprecedented surge in intra-regional trade, investment, and even tourism over the last two decades.
The good news is that Abe has shown signs of this kind of courage.
Given this, free riders (those who enjoy the benefits of the good without investing in its provision) are likely to be plentiful.
Enter this month’s European Council meeting: on December 19-20, heads of state and government from the EU’s 28 member countries will convene to discuss the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP).
As national budgets shrink under the effects of austerity, the EU should review member states’ spending on security.
Europe and an increasingly unstable world need a viable framework for global security.
Development of unconventional oil and gas supported 2.1 million jobs and contributed $74 billion in tax revenues and royalty payments to government coffers in 2012.
If one region’s economy falters, all countries feel the effects.
Especially in Germany, the Energiewende (the shift away from nuclear energy following the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011) has led to an increase in coal consumption.
Just last month, Dmitri Medvedev’s first visit to China as Russia’s prime minister resulted in a ten-year, $85 billion oil-supply deal for the state-owned energy giant Rosneft.
Cheap energy sources, however, can eventually come at a high price, albeit with a politically tricky time lag.
By moving to annex Crimea, Putin, supported massively – thus far – by domestic public opinion, seems to be ending the post-imperial frustration of the past two decades.
Russia needs Ukraine if it is to build the so-called Eurasian Union, the economic bloc that Putin is seeking with Kazakhstan and Belarus.
The EU Association Agreement threatened none of Russia’s interests, whether economic or cultural.
Second, given that the risk of conflict is greatest in Ukraine’s Russophone east, an OSCE mission should be deployed there to ensure stability, security, and respect for minorities, and to condemn, if necessary, violations of specified commitments.
He and Russia will suffer international isolation, while Ukrainians are likely to become even more insistent on choosing their own path.
Netanyahu has made Iran’s nuclear program his highest foreign-policy priority.
Saudi Arabia seeks the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and believes that America’s agreement with Russia to destroy the Assad regime’s chemical weapons amounts to renunciation of that goal.
But the episode sets a dangerous precedent.
Negotiation and diplomacy are the only sure way to resolve the standoff with Iran over its nuclear program.
On July 14, France’s national holiday, which this year marked the 225th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, Algerian soldiers paraded down the Champs-Élysées for the first time since Algeria’s war for independence a half-century ago, a moving symbol of historic transcendence.
Indeed, today’s Europe can no longer be the two-country affair – if it ever was that ‒ of 30 years ago.
Just as Germany took a step forward by giving up its Deutshce Mark in favor of the euro, France must evolve beyond the classical framework of the nation-state.
Liberty, equality, and fraternity are enemies of the nationalist, extremist, and europhobic visions benighting Europe today.
Still, there have already been significant changes, and the region is advancing – though the destination remains unknown.
Tunisia adopted its new constitution on January 27, thus clearing the way for what will be the most secular and fairest elections in any of the region’s countries.
Political pluralism cannot be imposed.
Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and 23 years after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the post-communist transition is still incomplete.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been studying the phenomenon since 1988.
In a globalized world, for example, citizens of nation-states might wonder (as many have) why a financial crisis a hemisphere away causes their countries’ banks to collapse abruptly.
Top-down governance approaches have been useful, showing the willingness of some of the historical greenhouse-gas emitters to accept remedial responsibility.
We need to open our eyes, recognize the crack in the foundation, and face our responsibility to fix it.
But that is no longer the case – a reality that is reflected in the international community’s muddled responses to similar territorial breaches today.
Worse, given their frequent unwillingness to accommodate one another’s interests, impasses – even clashes – become likely.
European politics are, too, undergoing a potentially significant transition, with the new European Commission set to commence operations, against a worrying background of rising nationalism in European Union member states.
How the coalition will be organized and what results it will achieve remain to be seen.
In South and East Asia, democracies outnumber dictatorships by 17 to six.
The Belgians were particularly brutal in Congo. The Spanish and Portuguese ravaged Latin America.
However, following the industrial revolution in northwestern Europe, the colonization of much of Asia, and the Opium Wars in China, their relative positions switched. By the 1950’s, Asia’s share of global GDP had fallen to less than 20%.
Many of the world’s largest cities, built on seacoasts and rivers, face the threat of rising sea levels and intensifying storms.
They are the ones responsible for providing safe water, garbage collection, safe housing, infrastructure, upgraded slums, protection from disasters, and emergency services when catastrophes hit.
Achieving these three goals will require good governance, public finance, and effective institutions.
Cities need to upgrade their governance, to allow for a greater role for poorer and more marginalized communities, and to enable much more effective coordination across city lines when a metropolitan area is home to many individual cities.
Winning the Fight Against Killer Diseases
TB was also running out of control, with a massive disease burden in both Asia and Africa.
At the international AIDS conference in Durban, South Africa, in July 2000, I described why a new global fund was needed to fight AIDS.
Over the objection of the aid skeptics, the Global Fund provided financial support for massive free distribution of bed nets, diagnostics, and medicines to address malaria.
The world has benefited enormously from the triumph of generosity, professionalism, common decency, and good sense.
May they, and we, choose life.
The choice seems obvious, but our actions speak louder than words.
For example, we can design our buildings to use sunlight and natural-air circulation so that they require far less commercial energy for heating, cooling, and ventilation.
Yet politicians are pursuing none of these policies adequately.
Kevin Rudd, the former Australian prime minister, tried to implement a clean-energy policy in his coal-producing country.
Not only will they have saved the planet for the next generation; they will also enjoy sunshine and clean, healthy air.
And the fourth is economic: to lay claim to a larger share of North Sea oil and gas.
Both accepted the division, and, knowing that their future lay within the EU, focused their attention on accession.
In this scenario, a financial panic could indeed be provoked, and both Scotland and the RUK would suffer economically.
Even if Scotland declares independence, it will – and should continue to be – bound by a dense web of European and global rules and responsibilities.


ईबोला कम से कम चार पश्चिमी अफ्रीकी देशों (गिनी, लाइबेरिया, सिएरा लियोन, और नाइजीरिया) में एक भयानक महामारी बन गया है जिसे फैलने से रोकने के लिए न केवल आपातकालीन कार्रवाई किया जाना जरूरी है; बल्कि वैश्विक जन स्‍वास्‍थ्‍य के बारे में कुछ मूल धारणाओं पर पुनर्विचार किया जाना भी जरूरी है। हम एक ऐसे युग में रह रहे हैं जहाँ ऐसे संक्रामक रोग उभरते हैं और बारंबार उभरते हैं, जो वैश्विक नेटवर्कों के ज़रिए तुरंत फैल सकते हैं। अत: इस वास्तविकता को देखते हुए हमें इसी के अनुरूप वैश्विक रोग-नियंत्रण प्रणाली की आवश्‍यकता है। सौभाग्‍य से एक प्रणाली मौजूद है, बशर्ते हम उसमें उपयुक्त तरीके से निवेश कर सकें।


The United States, for example, will “concede” a little bit of CO2 reduction if China will do the same.
But neither the US nor China is ready to sacrifice millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to do so.
Lackner is a world leader in new CCS strategies.
They should take their cue from other cases in which government, scientists, and industry teamed up to produce major changes.
So, yes, let the upcoming climate negotiations spell out shared actions by the US, China, Europe, and others.
What is stopping them is the belief that the US or some other outside power (such as Russia) will deliver a decisive victory on their behalf.
The US supported the 1968 coup that brought the Ba’ath Party – and Saddam – to power.
Yet whenever a new Middle East crisis erupts, the latest being triggered by the Islamic State’s recent gains, the US intervenes again, perhaps to change a government (as it has just orchestrated in Iraq) or to launch a new bombing assault.
I am not claiming that all will be well if the US and other powers pull back.
The last chance for action has arrived.
Global fossil-fuel use gravely threatens the poor, who are the most vulnerable to climate change (though the rich are the main cause), and future generations, who will inherit a planet that has become unlivable in many places, with food supply subject to massive shocks.
Though the Murdoch propaganda machine churns out a daily stream of anti-scientific falsehoods, the public also sees prolonged droughts (now in parts of Brazil, California, and Southeast Asia, to name a few places), massive floods (recently in Bosnia and Serbia), and lethal heat waves (in many parts of the world).
Fifth, the Paris negotiations are finally beginning to attract global attention from both the public and world leaders.
International use of the dollar to hold foreign-exchange reserves, denominate financial transactions, invoice trade, and as a vehicle in currency markets is below its level during the heyday of the Bretton Woods era, from 1945 to 1971.
Interestingly, the periods when the public is most concerned about the issue do not coincide with the periods when the dollar’s share in international transactions is in fact falling.
Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reported in its recent triennial survey that the dollar’s share in the world’s foreign-exchange trades rose from 85% in 2010 to 87% in 2013.
To try to explain the recent stabilization of the dollar’s status, one might note something that the last three years have in common with the previous period of temporary reversal from 1992 to 2000: striking improvements in the US budget deficit.
CAMBRIDGE – The US Congress has now carelessly blocked a long-awaited reform of the International Monetary Fund.
It goes back a century, to President Woodrow Wilson’s inability in 1919 to persuade a myopically isolationist Congress to approve the League of Nations.
It was widely reported that Asian countries concluded from Obama’s absence that they should cultivate ties with China instead.
Meanwhile, Europe’s fiscal follies have been even more egregious than America’s.
So why are such mechanisms now in retreat?
George H. W. Bush’s administration used it to reduce SO2 emissions from power plants in the 1990’s, and his son’s administration sought to use it to reduce SO2 and other emissions further in the 2000’s.
The ETS rapidly became the world’s largest system for putting a market price on environmental damage. But now it has been pushed aside by other kinds of regulation. 
The core of Obamacare is an attempt to ensure that all Americans have health insurance, via the individual mandate.
In the case of health care, a national monopoly can forestall innovation and provide inadequate care with long waits.
And when soaring global prices for Argentina’s leading agricultural commodities provided a golden opportunity to boost output and raise chronically insufficient foreign-currency earnings, Fernández imposed heavy tariffs and quotas on exports of soy, wheat, and beef.
Indentured servitude and debtors’ prisons have also been illegal since the nineteenth century.
Eventually, it was recognized that a debt overhang was inhibiting investment and growth in Latin America, to the detriment of debtors and creditors alike.
By contrast, the US court rulings’ indulgence of a parochial instinct to enforce written contracts will undermine the possibility of negotiated re-structuring in future debt crises.
After the monetarist approach failed, some switched to targeting the inflation rate.
These countries’ need to establish policy credibility tends to be more acute, whether as a result of histories of high inflation, an absence of credible institutions, or political pressure to monetize budget deficits. They need targets with which they can really live.
But this defeats the very purposes – transparency, credibility, and predictability – for which a target was announced in the first place.
Their economies also tend to suffer larger supply shocks from natural disasters, other weather events, social unrest, and unexpected productivity changes.
NGDP targeting is that plan.
The eurozone has no centrally issued and traded Eurobond that the central bank could buy.
(After all, there would be little point in upholding pristine principles if doing so resulted in a breakup, and fiscal austerity alone was never going to return the periphery countries to sustainable debt paths.)
The increase in the supply of euros would naturally lower their price.
But proposals to coordinate policies internationally for mutual benefit are fair.
The Mo Ibrahim Foundation supports other important activities, particularly the annual Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), which was also released on October 14.
Given the abundant attention received by Africa’s truly awful leaders, it is useful to focus on its good ones.
But it is not useful to rely solely or primarily on outcomes to judge a leader.
The question is then whether any candidate demonstrated the necessary level of excellence in office.
They may now regard themselves as indispensable.
LONDON – The election of Jeremy Corbyn as the new leader of the British Labour Party is a reminder that life is rich with paradox.
The Labour Party’s defeat in May’s general election brought about the resignation of its leader, Ed Miliband, a courteous and intelligent figure who, having abandoned the middle ground once controlled by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, had failed to convince even his own party that he could run the country.
Trade unions would regain the power they enjoyed before Margaret Thatcher’s reforms in the 1980s.
Second, without effective and responsible opposition, governments can become arrogant, careless, and too focused on their own supporters.
Taking Corbynomics Seriously
Today’s particular economic circumstances provide a second reason for establishing a National Investment Bank.
This idea of monetary financing of fiscal deficits (borrowing from the central bank, rather than from the bond markets) has a reputable pedigree.
But it is hardly the case that the UK economy, currently growing at close to 3% a year, needs a further QE program of any kind right now.
Millions in Europe rightly feel that the current economic order fails to serve their interests.
But many among the public and in the media want more.
Today, it is clear that fundamentalists and their supporters are completely closed off to even the most elaborate theological refutation of their views, even when produced by distinguished religious authorities.
In fact, debates about the use of religious terms lend credibility to fundamentalist efforts to apply these ideas to conditions in the modern world.
There is simply no need to look to theology to call a crime by its proper name.
And, fortunately, we live in an age in which information technology gives us the right tools to broaden access to high-quality, affordable education.
Exam results are recorded on the teacher’s tablet, with more than 250,000 scores logged every 21 days.
As a result, teachers spend their time in the most effective way possible – solving problems with students – instead of delivering undifferentiated lessons.
Jinnah’s Labyrinth
That was Jinnah’s dream, but the reality is that Pakistan has lived in high drama ever since its birth, often troubled by dark and imaginary historical shadows.
But Pakistani society is now an orphan, dependant almost totally on both the Pakistani Army and the all-pervasive Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) , which has grown into a state within a state, answerable only to itself .
With near-zero GDP growth, rising unemployment, and mounting public debt – not to mention counter-productive austerity policies – it is difficult to argue otherwise.
As a result, these countries’ virtual exchange rates vis-à-vis Germany are critically overvalued, inasmuch as wages in these countries have risen more quickly, and labor productivity more slowly, than in Germany.
And the common monetary policy that all are being forced to pursue is intensifying deflationary pressures in the weaker countries, while increasing inflationary pressures in Germany.
For their part, other EU member countries would have to decide whether to retain the euro in its truncated form or revert to their own national currencies, possibly pegging them to the revived Deutsche Mark or franc.
Today, nearly 2,000 metric tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium – the raw materials of a nuclear weapon – are spread across 25 countries.
The weakest link in the security chain threatens everyone, and that means a system is needed to identify and strengthen the weak links – a system in which states take steps to build confidence in – and accountability for – their security performance.
·         The system should cover all weapons-useable materials, including nuclear materials used for military purposes.
CHICAGO – Monetary and fiscal policies in the United States, both in this recession and the recession of 2001, have been among the most accommodating in the industrial world.  As I write, Congress is working on yet another “jobs” bill.  Indeed, John Taylor of Stanford University attributes the recent financial crisis to excessively stimulatory monetary policy towards the end of Alan Greenspan’s tenure as head of the US Federal Reserve.
Others suggest that the Internet has made it easier for firms to hire quickly.
That lesson has been fully internalized.
For example, households and investment managers, reluctant to keep money in safe money-market funds, instead seek to invest in securities with longer maturities and higher credit risk, so long as they offer extra yield.
But, if politicians are to become less anxious about jobs, perhaps we need to start discussing whether jobless recoveries are here to stay, and whether the US safety net, devised for a different era, needs to be modified.
But that is not supported by theory or experience.
These investments generally have the effect (in advanced and developing countries alike) of raising the return to private investment, causing the latter to expand in scale and scope, lifting employment along with it.  Reforming the tax system to favor investment and eliminate complexity and inefficiency would help.
Restoring elements of manufacturing competitiveness is hard.
It is not a good idea to assume that markets will solve these distributional problems by themselves; the evolution of structure and the income distribution are largely the result of market incentives.
आज मच्छरों की आबादी रोकने के लिए जो प्रचलित तरीका है - कीटों का बंध्याकरण का - वह रेडिएशन द्वारा नर कीटों के बंध्याकरण पर निर्भर है. बंध्याकरण के बाद इन नर कीटों को ग्रस्त इलाकों में छोड़ दिया जाता है लेकिन वे प्रजनन करने में असमर्थ होते हैं. मगर पिछली सदी के मध्य से इस्तेमाल की जा रही यह तकनीक मच्छरों के मामले में प्रभावकारी नहीं रही है. कारण है मच्छरों की नाजुकता.

Nor does Netanyahu, an ideologue who is visibly uncomfortable with his forced support of the two-state idea, truly have a governing coalition for peace.
And a permanent Iranian presence in Syria would make a war between Israel and Iran practically unavoidable.
Inertia is not an adequate response in an era of revolutionary change.
A solution to the Palestinian problem would serve such a strategy.
He appears to be proposing further tax cuts that promise to cost the United States Treasury some $300 billion a year, to “offset” them with cuts in earmarked spending accounted for at $3 billion a year, and somehow to balance the budget.
By 2016, America’s productive potential would be smaller by an amount that would reduce real GDP by 3.6% – $500 billion real dollars, or roughly $3,000 per worker.
Other countries that are counting on exporting to America would be affected by slower growth and lower employment in the US.
For-profit education is not just a US phenomenon; it is part of a global trend.
For example, E-Corp-owned colleges might be required to provide prospective students with the graduation rate, average student-debt levels, and the average starting salaries of students with similar academic records and educational goals. Furthermore, E-Corp colleges might be required to reveal their per student instructional, marketing, and executive-compensation costs, as well as their pre-tax profits.
BERKELEY – One of the dirty secrets of economics is that there is no such thing as “economic theory.”
The other type takes the carcass of history, throws it into the pot, turns up the heat, and boils it down, hoping that the bones will yield lessons and suggest principles to guide our civilization’s voters, bureaucrats, and politicians as they slouch toward utopia.
When the excess demand is for longer-term assets – bonds to serve as vehicles for savings that move purchasing power from the present into the future – the natural response is twofold: induce businesses to borrow more and build more capacity, and encourage the government to borrow and spend, thus bringing the supply of bonds back into balance with demand.
I see production 10% below capacity, and I see unemployment rates approaching 10%.
For example, post-conflict democratization cannot be the goal, given that Arab regimes lack the credentials or knowhow to craft democracies, and their militaries are neither willing nor able to assist in the process.
The adventure also took a heavy economic toll; by 1965, Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $3 billion, forcing it to add a “defense tax” to finance the Yemen war.
If Arab leaders fail to overcome these deficiencies, the latest Arab force could become the Middle East’s newest source of anti-democratic, sectarian-based instability, potentially intensifying the Sunni-Shia conflict.
But uncertainty is far better than knowing acquiescence.
And, for better or for worse, it is a key supplier to certain countries.
The three that count because of their size – Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico – are all frightened of the consequences: Brazil that its companies will lose contracts, Mexico that the Venezuelans will finance opposition to their energy reforms, and Argentina of losing an ally that knows too much.
World Cup Blues
Santos lost by nearly five percentage points.
Even soaring commodity prices, bolstered by strong demand from China, became problematic, with the expectation of a terms-of-trade reversal generating significant uncertainty.
Likewise, contrary to the perceptions of Uribe’s supporters, Santos’s reelection and continued pursuit of peace is exactly what Colombia needs right now.
Economic uncertainty is also dramatically affecting Brazilian politics.
Fortunately for Silva, the PSDB is highly critical of the PT administration, especially the foreign policy of Rousseff’s predecessor, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva.
The incumbent’s advantage in Latin America owes much to the feeble regulations restricting the government’s use of the state apparatus for campaign purposes.
It could hardly be otherwise.
Others have mused that Peña Nieto’s administration sometimes seems intent on announcing reforms, regardless of their content, the time necessary to implement them, or their actual impact on Mexican society.
The same is true of ballot initiatives, referenda, and independent candidacies, all of which were non-existent until the recent reform.
But curtailing democracy in order to modernize the energy sector is not a good idea.
So Crimea was just the first target; the next will be eastern Ukraine and persistent destabilization of the country as a whole.
Moreover, Russia’s rapid demographic decline and enormous modernization deficit imply the need for a joint future with Europe.
Today’s Russia has neither the economic nor the political strength to regain and integrate the lost Soviet territories, and any attempt by Putin to press on with his plan would impoverish its people and lead to further disintegration – a bleak prospect.
The question of peace in Europe has returned, and it must be answered by a strong and united EU.
Ideologically, the central conflict between Iran and its neighbors is based on the sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia Islam.
Their strategic watchwords are national rivalry, balance, and hegemony – concepts that offer no solution for the future of the region’s nations and states.
Obama is heavily criticized for not having intervened militarily in Syria, even though his threat to do so subsequently forced President Bashar al-Assad’s government to surrender its chemical weapons.
Indeed, the Great War’s consequences for international relations and the global system of states continue to be felt.
Likewise, the creation of Israel harks back to the 1917 Balfour Declaration, whereby the subsequent British mandatory power in Palestine supported the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people.
Institutions and traditions supporting cooperative conflict resolution hardly exist in the region.
But, lest we forget: in the summer 1914, most actors regarded the impending disaster as an impossibility.
Europeans should brace themselves for what is coming.
For Europe, this would be a fundamental change for the worse.
Whether the Euromaidan revolution succeeds will depend to a crucial extent on the Ukrainian people and their ability to free themselves from the structures and forces of the past, and on the West’s support, generosity, and resilience.
But realizing that potential will be difficult.
How much supervision will be required not just to verify compliance but also to detect any possible attempt at a breakout?
These are the real factors driving the confrontation that the Vienna negotiations are meant to defuse over the next six months.
Iran must decide whether it wants to follow the North Korean route to international isolation, or some variation on the Chinese route to integration into the global economy.
The staggering accumulation of crises and conflicts facing the world today – in Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Gaza, and Libya – are linked to America’s new stance.
And yet the frequency of crises has also revived in Western countries an old, fundamental normative conflict between idealism and realism, or a value-based and an interest-based foreign policy.
A victory for the IS in northern Iraq, or even just the capture of Erbil, the Kurdish Regional Government’s capital, would cause not just an unparalleled humanitarian disaster; it would also pose an enormous political threat to the greater Middle East and world peace.
If the US can no longer bear the burden of Pax Americana, Europe must do more for collective security.
While the system was effectively eliminated in 1971, the US dollar’s central role in the international monetary system has remained intact – a reality that many countries are increasingly unwilling to accept.
Furthermore, though countries accrue interest on their holdings of SDRs, they have to pay interest on the allocations they receive.
The simplest way to fulfill this vision would be to allocate SDRs as a full reserve asset, which countries could either use or deposit in their IMF accounts.
The better-known consequence has been deepening uncertainty about the US dollar, the main global reserve currency, and US Treasury securities, supposedly the world’s “safest” financial asset.
There have been myriad academic contributions to the debate as well.
Still another element of international monetary reform is better management of the global exchange-rate system (or, again, “non-system”), which should aim at avoiding currency “manipulation” – but only after defining precisely what that means.
Try to imagine 143,000 Eiffel Towers stacked one on top of another, or a pile of 10 trillion bananas.
From any perspective – ethical, economic, environmental, or in terms of food security – we simply cannot tolerate the annual wastage of 1.3 billion tons of food.
For example, rejection of food products on the basis of aesthetic concerns is a major cause of wastage.
Only if they do can the region become a significant global player.
Mercosur members, by contrast, remain wary of excessive trade liberalization and, with the exception of Brazil (and to a lesser extent Uruguay), are significantly less competitive.
Latin America’s exports to what is now the world’s fastest-growing region are concentrated among primary goods.
Argentina’s Griesafault
The experiment failed, and the country suffered a deep economic and social crisis, with a recession that lasted from 1998 to 2002.
They then sued Argentina to obtain 100% of that value.
And, because the debt restructuring stipulated that all of the creditors who accepted it could demand the same terms as holdouts receive, Argentina might be on the hook for $140 billion more.
In fact, borrowing costs on July 30 were lower than the average for the whole year.
Most recently, the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) recommended new terms for government bonds.
In 1999, in Elliot Associates, LP v. Banco de la Nacion and the Republic of Peru, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the plaintiff’s intent in purchasing the discounted debt was to be paid in full or otherwise to sue.
But CACs do not exist for sovereign debt written in many jurisdictions, leaving the field open for the vultures.
But this, too, poses a problem: The more junior creditors could vote to have themselves treated in the same way as more senior creditors.
Global efforts are good first steps to remedy the damage to international financial markets that the US courts have inflicted.
Or perhaps this innovation is less significant than its enthusiasts believe.
Two things should be clear.
And this is even more apparent in other arenas: How do we accurately assess the fact that, owing to medical progress, heart surgery is more likely to be successful now than in the past, leading to a significant increase in life expectancy and quality of life?
But innovation has been part of the developed world’s economy for more than two centuries.
Schumpeter’s conclusions have not gone unchallenged.
Government, it is often said, should not be engaged in picking winners. The market is far better in making such judgments.
There is a compelling infant economy argument for industrial protection.
NEW YORK – International investment agreements are once again in the news.
They restrict governments even from placing temporary controls on the kind of destabilizing short-term capital flows that have so often wrought havoc in financial markets and fueled crises in developing countries.
Even the notion that this is about protecting foreign firms is a ruse: companies based in country A can set up a subsidiary in country B to sue country A’s government.
There have even been demands that countries honor contracts signed by previous non-democratic and corrupt governments, even when the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral organizations have recommended that the contract be abrogated.
South Africa should be congratulated.
Such investments ensure that all citizens, no matter how poor their parents, can live up to their potential.
And taxing natural-resource rents at high rates does not cause the adverse consequences that follow from taxing savings or work (reserves of iron ore and natural gas cannot move to another country to avoid taxation).
America’s failed financial model for higher education is one of the reasons that, among the advanced countries, America now has the least equality of opportunity, with the life prospects of a young American more dependent on his or her parents’ income and education than in other advanced countries.
Europe’s Austerity Zombies
In even the best-performing economies, such as Germany, growth since the 2008 crisis has been so slow that, in any other circumstance, it would be rated as dismal.
When citizens repeatedly vote for a change of policy – and few policies matter more to citizens than those that affect their standard of living – but are told that these matters are determined elsewhere or that they have no choice, both democracy and faith in the European project suffer.
Likewise, Italy is being encouraged to accelerate privatization.
ZURICH – The BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) have long been the focus of emerging-market investors.
Nearly one in 20 adults in the 15-49 age group in Sub-Saharan Africa lives with HIV – roughly six times the global average.
Joining this mobile-phone revolution, Novartis is working with five African governments and private-sector partners to improve drug distribution and monitor the supply of anti-malaria medicines in rural areas, using text messaging and electronic mapping.
Finally, education is one of the most powerful tools for reducing poverty and generating sustainable, inclusive economic growth.
This will require more than philanthropy: it will demand new commercial models that solve health-care issues, help the economy to grow, and benefit those who invest in Africa’s future.
Tellingly, US President Barack Obama’s administration has replaced the term “pivot,” which implies a turn away from something, with “rebalancing.”
Clinton rejected that advice: It would have been impossible to forge an anti-China alliance, given the enduring desire of China’s neighbors to maintain good relations with it; more important, such a policy would have guaranteed future enmity with China.
Indeed, it is not in China’s interest to destroy international institutions – such as the United Nations, the WTO, and the International Monetary Fund – that have helped to facilitate its rise.
Whether China’s economic interest in an impartial world order based on the rule of law will lead to greater protection of individual rights remains to be seen.
First, Americans understand little about the social and political complexities of the countries there.
In recent centuries, the nation has been the imagined community for which most people were willing to make sacrifices, and even to die, and most leaders have seen their primary obligations to be national in scope.
In one sense, she is right.
Honor thy father and thy mother admits of gradations.”
Based on the notion of “multi-stakeholderism,” the meeting produced a 12-page “outcomes” document.
Ultimately, however, the Internet poses a major governance challenge, exemplified in ongoing efforts to understand the implications of ubiquitous mobility and the collection and storage of “big data.”
Indeed, accounts of cyber war may be exaggerated, but cyber espionage is rampant, and more than 30 governments are reputed to have developed offensive capabilities and doctrines for the use of cyber weapons.
Though the meeting was ostensibly about updating telephony regulations, the underlying issue was the ITU’s role in Internet governance.
What will governance look like in 2050?
For example, although megacities have the potential to create new opportunities for workers and businesses, they cannot solve universal problems like climate change or manage the production and protection of national and global public goods.
For example, in Kenya, a private company developed a mobile-payments system that allows users to transfer money using cell phones, effectively creating a banking system much more quickly than the government could have done.
But, though the G-20 has moved in this direction, the approach to setting a global agenda remains flawed.
Japan’s Self-Defense Defense
When US President Barack Obama’s administration announced its “rebalancing” toward Asia in 2011, it reaffirmed the 1996 Clinton-Hashimoto Declaration, which cited the US-Japan security alliance as the foundation for stability – a prerequisite for continued economic progress – in Asia.
But, as things stand, a strategy of containment would be a mistake.
As China invests in advanced ballistic missiles, the fixed bases on Okinawa become increasingly vulnerable.
Meanwhile, Japan’s economy seems to be recovering from a generation of malaise, with this year’s annualized growth rate exceeding 3%.
But, of course, this can change – and Japan does have a history of successfully reinventing itself.
China challenges Japanese control over more than seven square kilometers of islets – called the Senkaku Islands in Japan, and the Diaoyu Islands in China – in the East China Sea.
While Japan’s security treaty with the US serves as a deterrent, there is always a danger of miscalculation.
Yet the question lingered.
Further evidence of American isolationism can be found in a recent opinion poll taken by the Pew Research Center and the Council on Foreign Relations.
In structural terms, it matters greatly that the two entities in the world with economies and per capita income similar to the US – Europe and Japan – are both American allies.
A smart power strategy starts with a clear assessment of limits.
Colombia’s Modest Peace
With Europe offering only empty promises, and the UN unsure of how to catalyze progress on the talks’ ambitious 12-point agenda (which included more than 100 items), the effort collapsed in 2002.
Today, the guerrillas are significantly weaker, allowing Santos’s government to offer a minimalist agreement that can satisfy both the Colombian establishment, which backs the process but without much conviction, and a fatigued and mercurial public that wants peace but remains unwilling to accept too many concessions to the FARC.
That requires that the talks progress steadily, and that the FARC remains reliable and united.
The Court must rule on German plaintiffs’ claim that legislation to establish the ESM would violate Germany’s Grundgesetz (Basic Law).
Indeed, the new currency was conceived as a unit of account for economic exchange that would not have any wealth implications at all.
If losses arise, they must be covered by the initial cash contribution of €80 billion ($100 billion), which then would be topped up automatically by all participating countries according to their capital shares.
It is good that the Court’s decisions cannot be forecast, and even better that the Court cannot be lobbied or petitioned.
But the test of the trials will be whether they are – and are seen to be – fact-driven, impartial, and consistent with international standards.
This must be reinforced by vigorous independent monitoring throughout the process.
Meaningful public engagement with the court requires an underlying environment that fosters – not punishes – the free expression of ideas.
How the court performs matters deeply to the millions of Cambodians scarred by the crimes of the Khmer Rouge.
In 1977, the US created the Department of Energy (DOE); a year later, it enacted the National Energy Act, which employed tools like industrial regulation and tax incentives to promote fuel efficiency and renewable energy.
As was true in the 1970’s, innovation is the key to effective solutions.
Our livelihoods, not to mention those of future generations, should not be held hostage by our ongoing addiction to fossil fuels.
He attended church. He said agriculture was the backbone of our nation.
When my father came home that night, he was singing praises for Mandela.
As I learned more about Mandela, I wondered how he had achieved the unimaginable, overcoming a 27-year ordeal to become the leader of Africa’s largest economy.
Unfortunately for many African countries, freedom and independence ended up in the hands of a few who had tasted and become addicted to the repressive practices that Africans had spent decades fighting.
Perhaps the most notable exceptions to this rule have been in East Asia, where four economies – South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore – responded to external crises and challenges by shifting their growth strategies.
One of the East Asian economies’ major lessons for developing countries is that economic development leads to institutional transformation, not the other way around.
FRANKFURT – The European Central Bank is in the middle of a big, risky experiment.
All of this is intended to flood the markets, expand the euro system’s balance sheet by €700 billion ($890 billion), and return to the balance-sheet volume recorded at the start of 2012.
But what is the appropriate eurozone inflation rate, given de facto economic stagnation? Should higher nominal (that is, inflation-driven) growth replace debt-driven growth?
Government action in many problem countries ultimately ends in finger pointing: “Europe,” the ECB, and Germany, with its (relatively) responsible policy, have all been scapegoats.
But the uncertainty regarding the extent and pace of economic reforms remains.
The Court has required that amnesties granted to political and military leaders in Argentina and other countries in the region as part of a transition to democracy be set aside.
New democracies face many political – and often economic – challenges.
Tyrants everywhere – and more than a few democrats – would do well to take note.
To many bankers, these are just details to be overlooked.
It was widely known that banks and mortgage companies were engaged in predatory lending practices, taking advantage of the least educated and most financially uninformed to make loans that maximized fees and imposed enormous risks on the borrowers.
With one out of four mortgages in the US under water – more owed than the house is worth – there is a growing consensus that the only way to deal with the mess is to write down the value of the principal (what is owed).
Rather, it would enable the powerful to exploit the weak.
“An eye for an eye” asks that the culprit should be the sole target, and not others, whose only crime was to be related to him.
We had to make our homes in this, our common motherland, and learn to live with one another.
Restorative justice and ubuntu are based firmly on the recognition of the fundamental humanity of even the worst possible offender.
There is a wealth of wisdom in the old ways of African society.
LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA – Pundits have long predicted that biology would dominate the twenty-first century, just as physics dominated the twentieth century.
While the first recombinant insulin in the 1980’s took less than a decade from testing to approval, monoclonal antibodies and gene therapy took more than 20 years to reach the same milestone.
Finally, while drugs are increasingly produced by small companies that larger pharmaceutical firms then acquire, funding for these start-ups is drying up.
At the same time, governments will have to implement policies aimed at guiding investment toward specific diseases.
The decision came a month after Premier Li Keqiang’s declaration that China had set its annual growth target at “around 7.5%” – the same as last year’s goal.

For starters, there is the public-good element of many infrastructure projects, which demands contingent government obligations like universal coverage levels for basic services.
With nearly 70% of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population lacking access to electricity and 65% of South Asians lacking access to basic sanitation, there is no greater imperative than to plan, fund, build, and maintain infrastructure assets.
Health workers worry about sexually transmitted diseases and malnutrition.
On the other hand, rapid population growth as a result of higher birth rates can threaten the wellbeing of the poorest communities and countries, by altering the dependency ratio at the other end of the scale.
Until recently, the global population was predicted to surpass 11 billion by 2050, triggering Malthusian fears.
None of this should divert attention from the need to achieve a balance between population growth, appropriate dependency ratios for countries at different stages of economic development, and the fight for women’s reproductive rights.
Here is a leader who read a hidden, menacing agenda into a technical European Union document about export subsidies and anti-fraud provisions.
The West should also listen carefully to Ukraine’s neighbor, Poland, which probably has the deepest insight into the complexities of the crisis.
The Magnitsky Act should be amended to include the names of political and military leaders responsible for the invasion of Ukraine.
If the 2008 Russo-Georgian war is any guide, NATO’s Cyber Defense Center should help Ukraine prepare for a large-scale digital offensive.
When Ukrainians stood up against their corrupt elite, they became the first people to put their lives on the line for the goal of EU membership.
Before the financial crisis hit in 2008, all of these policies would have been disparaged as unwarranted interventions in financial markets. Indeed, in 2005, when one of us (Werner) recommended such policies to prevent “recurring banking crises,” he faced vehement criticism.
With an understanding of this process, policymakers can take steps to avert future banking crises and resolve post-crisis recessions more effectively.
With the local authority effectively issuing money for work performed, the local economy boomed.
After all, it was Merkel who tried to calm the waters after the NSA scandal first hit Europe this summer. That is why the alleged US wiretapping of her cellphone is so damaging for her, both personally and politically.
The potential economic cost of a delay or a failure to achieve closer transatlantic economic integration could total hundreds of billions of dollars – in addition to the incalculable damage done to America’s credibility in Europe.
They stepped in when private markets froze, acting as lenders and dealers of last resort, and provided additional liquidity to grease the wheels of finance.
But even this frightening analogy does not answer the question of whether central banks should assume positions of power in international relations.
Aren’t both members of NAFTA? Why Switzerland and not Brazil, one of the largest emerging markets?
America’s Debt-Ceiling Debacle
The difference is ultimately minor, and should not be allowed to overshadow what is really at stake: democratic self-governance in an age of high public debt.
In times of economic growth, debt finance provides an easy escape from difficult choices.
Constitutional debt limits have yet to be tested in times of emergency, when new funding is needed quickly.
But doubts have crept in – and not only since the revelations of government agencies’ use of the Internet to spy on us, our leaders, and one another.
They employ armies of people to vet and skew online conversations.
While democracies have arguably become more vibrant, their politics have become more volatile.
The average age of party members in Germany is over 50.
Reason and the End of Poverty
But this is mere suggestion.
That is a wrong deduction, based on evidence that does not exist.
Cost-benefit analysis has led many to declare it a failed policy.
Although any such right extends only to activities for “peaceful purposes,” the loophole is gaping.
Although the issue has been much debated, until now there has been only modest progress in developing fuel-supply assurance arrangements that would meet this concern.
The bank has been funded by voluntary contributions, including $50 million from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a United States-based NGO, $49 million from the US government, up to $25 million from the European Union, $10 million each from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and $5 million from Norway.
The latter happened in October.
Indeed, in its report, the Commission has shown how to overcome them.
When the European Council opened the way for Turkish membership in 1999, it fully took into account the establishment of the European (political) Union by the Maastricht Treaty years earlier.
With North Korea, the provocations continue to come thick and fast.
But it is still not impossible.
But, with the escalating financial sanctions of the past year now clearly biting hard, the signs are more encouraging than they have been for some time.
America’s Real Drug Problem
In a Twitter exchange, he called a journalist “a moron,” and described the price hike as “a great business decision that also benefits all of our stakeholders.”
In the United Kingdom, for example, a regulatory body – NICE (National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness) – decides whether drugs are sufficiently cost-effective to justify reimbursement by the National Health Service.
Different groups may benefit differently, depending on factors such as age or socioeconomic status.
The FDA already awards these to manufacturers of new drugs for rare pediatric disorders.
Chinese surpluses, by contrast, were seen as a cause of global imbalances.
Europe’s non-eurozone surplus countries – Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Norway (all of which tie their exchange rates to the euro to some degree) – magnify this global imbalance.
But an abundance of pity alone will not help.
In the years preceding August 1914, until the assassination of the archduke, the global economy performed relatively well: trade expanded worldwide, financial markets seemed healthy, and the business community shrugged off political problems as either temporary or irrelevant.
The outbreak has so far remained regional, but it serves as a reminder that in an age of air travel by millions, no one is safe from the spread of infectious disease.
Partly because the United States makes capital increases and governance reforms in global financial institutions so difficult, the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) have launched their own development bank, to be based in Shanghai.
Catching Up at Different Speeds
Beyond global factors that apply to all, rapid catch-up growth requires sufficient investment in both physical and human capital. New manufacturing techniques and new products or product improvements are usually embodied in new machines and skills.
Latin America and Asia operate in the same global economy, with access to similar technology and markets. If Latin America invests around 20% of its national income in a sustained manner, while emerging Asia invests close to 30% – including investments in education – emerging Asia will converge significantly more rapidly.
The pan-European parties’ nomination of Spitzenkandidaten for the Commission presidency – and the three direct debates among the nominees – marked the start of building a genuine supranational European political space.
WASHINGTON, DC – For most of the beginning of 2014, the eurozone seemed to be in a state of recovery – weak and unsteady, but nonetheless real.
The eurozone now is facing not only a financial crisis, but a stagnation crisis.
These reforms should seek to achieve a thoroughly revamped social contract that reflects the realities of twenty-first-century demographics and global markets, but that also remains sensitive to Europeans’ commitment to distributive fairness and political equality, and insures citizens against shocks.
A new social contract will not appear out of thin air.
It is the nature of governance that determines whether people deploy their talents and energy in pursuit of innovation, production, and job creation, or in rent seeking and lobbying for political protection.
Such a vision presupposes an assurance that a winner-take-all system will not be established, as well as broad agreement that regulatory institutions should be reasonably non-partisan and staffed with competent professionals.
They also need regulatory agencies in sectors such as telecommunications and energy that can pursue policies in accordance with broad goals established by the political process, but with appointees selected according to nonpartisan criteria who then exercise their authority in a way that fosters competition open to all.
But a significant part of a central bank’s credibility ultimately derives from the broader macroeconomic environment in which it operates.
But a country’s long-term inflation rate is still the outcome of political choices not technocratic decisions.

As it turned out, the euro was not quite the free lunch that it seemed to be.
Nevertheless, given the huge governance problems that Italy still faces, there is every chance that its inflation rate would look more like Brazil’s or Turkey’s, with any debt problems spilling over faster price growth.
A simple and elegant solution is to phase in a switchover to a fully electronic currency, where paying interest, positive or negative, requires only the push of a button.
After two decades of telling the public that 2% inflation is Nirvana, central bankers would baffle people were they to announce that they had changed their minds – and not in some minor way, but completely.
They could not simultaneously debase the currency and back it with gold at a fixed rate.
And, as I have argued elsewhere, governments have long been penny-wise and pound-foolish to provide large-denomination notes, given that a large share are used in the underground economy and to finance illegal activities.
As a result, Malthus’s concerns about mass starvation have failed to materialize in any peaceful capitalist economy.
Until now, our societies have proved remarkably adept at adjusting to disruptive technologies; but the pace of change in recent decades has caused tremendous strains, reflected in huge income disparities within countries, with near-record gaps between the wealthiest and the rest.
Government interventions to date, mainly in the form of enhanced education, have proved largely ineffective.
Will each future generation continue to enjoy a better quality of life than its immediate predecessor? In developing countries that have not yet reached the technological frontier, the answer is almost certainly yes.
And government debt, of course, has risen sharply, owing to bank bailouts and a sharp, recession-fueled decline in tax revenues.
Last spring’s campaign against anyone who dared to worry about the long-run effects of high debt largely ignored the substantial academic literature, just as a remarkably similar recent challenge to Thomas Piketty’s research on inequality took no account of a larger body of evidence.
(The word “austerity” does not appear once in my 2009 book with Carmen Reinhart on the history of financial crises.)
If it is more forthright about the risks, there is a chance that some periphery countries might have difficulty plugging the holes, and will require help from the north.
This is particularly the case when naïve assistance serves to reinforce a dysfunctional status quo.
So much for precise forecasts of the date when China will overtake the US as the world’s largest economy; we won’t even know for sure when it happens!
Moreover, a great deal of this aid is delivered in kind and for strategic reasons, often supporting ineffective and kleptocratic governments.
For most of mankind, now is a better time than ever before to be alive.
Economists who trumpeted the “Buenos Aires consensus” as the new way to run economies also look foolish in hindsight.
Recently, as an outgrowth of a reconsideration of the IMF’s lending to the periphery of Europe (and Greece in particular), the Fund has advanced another approach to debt rescheduling, one that might be easier to implement.
It would be far better if the US found ways simply to organize outright grants in exceptional cases like Ukraine, rather than design the international financial system around them.
Deepening domestic debt markets – and perhaps change along the lines proposed by the IMF – is sorely needed.
He found that, owing to capital flight and political pressure for delay, the results were often disappointing.
Wealth taxes that target land and structures are arguably insulated from some of these concerns, and property taxes are relatively underused outside the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Many governments are giving in to higher marginal tax rates rather than overhauling and simplifying the system.
Temporary wealth taxes may well be a part of the answer for countries in fiscal trouble today, and the idea should be taken seriously.
Promoting alcohol, sugary drinks, and fast food may mean massive profits for corporations. But it also means worse health for individuals and a costly burden on countries’ health-care systems.
Given that these are precisely the kind of behaviors that companies like the World Cup sponsors are encouraging, a better disease classification would be pestilentia lucro causa (PLC), or “profit-driven disease.”
After all, the most effective way to compel companies to change is to stop purchasing what they sell.
In the battle against the PLCs, international and national regulatory authorities must fill this role, setting and enforcing the rules of the game to protect the health of people worldwide.
With continued assaults on local schools, Boko Haram has escalated its war against education – making the last two years Nigeria’s worst in terms of the violation of children’s rights.
Until recently, we have done far too little to protect schools and prevent their militarization during times of conflict.
When law and order break down, people need not only material help – food, shelter, and health care – but also hope.
Sedangkan 30% produksi teh dan 70% kopi di Kenya dihasilkan di bukit di kaki gunung dan lereng tinggi.

The Kibaki administration used this year to entrench power in the hands of a small ethnic Kikuyu clique.
The frenzied campaigning for the constitutional referendum began in uproar.
Having been buoyed by the successful and peaceful 2002 election that brought in the promise of change, the Kenyan public remains loudly outraged by the government’s failures to make good on its promises.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President Bush embarked on a unilateral foreign policy.
As a gesture intending to boost Kerry's chances, German Defense Minister Peter Struck suggested that his country might reconsider its position on troops in Iraq. But Chancellor Gerhard Schröder instantly shot down that trial balloon, declaring: "To be clear, we will send no troops to Iraq."
Most European leaders understand the tiny wiggle room that Kerry will have if elected.
Is Europe really ready to undertake such an effort if its wish for a Kerry victory comes true?
Recent developments in wind, solar, tidal, bio-energy, geothermal, and fuel-cell technology are transforming the scope for low-carbon energy production.
It is difficult to think of a more irresponsible use of public money.
Recent debates in the UK illustrate the emerging fault lines.
Rich G-20 countries could go further and faster.
But the bill is far more alarming than that.

Campaigns routinely planted spies – interns, household staff, or even lovers – in the opposing camp, and devoted vast numbers of man-hours to combing through private records in opposition research.
LONDON – For decades, Keynesianism was associated with social democratic big-government policies.
There was an idea, originally derived from Ricardo and Marx, that the capitalist class needed a “reserve army of the unemployed” to maintain its profit share.
Nevertheless, he did think that redistribution would help secure full employment.
The new focus on the need to tame the power of finance is largely a consequence of globalization.
The current crisis has shown with utmost clarity that private markets are unable to self-regulate; domestic regulation is therefore a key area in which government has a role to play.

When he gets around to economics, Cochrane aims his blows at two points: Krugman’s attack on the “efficient market theory” and his advocacy of “fiscal stimulus” for depressed economies.
In short, Krugman “has absolutely no idea about what caused the crash, what policies might have prevented it, and what policies we should adopt going forward” – except that the government should now spend money like a drunken sailor.
Against this view, Keynes pointed out that interest-rate reductions may not do the job, because at zero or near-zero rates investors hoard cash rather than lend it out.
This is not “irrational” behavior. It is reasonable behavior in the face of uncertainty.
Indeed, today the KGB/FSB is Russia’s primary business school. Think of the graduates as holding a master’s degree in brutal (and brutally inefficient) administration.
When not overseeing Rosneft, Sechin just happens to be Vladimir Putin’s first deputy prime minister.
Its investment plans are overextended outside of Russia – part of the imperial policy – while domestic exploration for new sources is declining, as foreign companies have been forced to surrender stakes in projects such as the huge gas development on Sakhalin Island.
Such a moment occurred 50 years ago, with Nikita Khrushchev’s so-called “Secret Speech” to the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
Khrushchev’s motives as he took the podium on the morning of February 25, 1956, were, in his mind, moral ones.
Five days after the Congress, his speech was sent to all the leaders of the socialist countries and read at local party meetings across the Soviet Union.
Khrushchev’s speech also ignited the feud between Mao’s China and the USSR, for it allowed Mao to claim the crown of world revolutionary leadership.
The Twentieth Congress shattered the world Communist movement, and it turned out to be impossible to cement the cracks.
Even after central banks have pushed government bond prices as high as they can go, they should keep buying government bonds for cash, in the hope that people whose pockets are full of cash will spend more of it, and that this will directly pull people out of joblessness and into employment.
Those are attractive odds.
With higher financial asset prices, those firms that ought to be expanding and hiring will be able to get money on more attractive terms.
Available reserves will increasingly be concentrated in the Middle East simply because supplies in all other regions will be depleted sooner.
Latecomers among consuming nations, such as China, mimic the former habits of the industrialized West, with their long record of overlooking human rights abuses in order to secure lucrative deals with authoritarian, oil-rich regimes.
Geopolitically, the benefits would similarly obvious, as the ability of major oil exporters to blackmail industrialized countries would be significantly reduced.
Unless patients with renal failure receive a kidney transplant or undergo dialysis – an expensive life-long procedure that cleanses the blood of toxins – death is guaranteed within a few weeks.
For example, after China, India, and Pakistan began cracking down on illicit organ markets, many patients turned to the Philippines.
My colleagues and I suggest a system in which compensation is provided by a third party (government, a charity, or insurance) with public oversight.
Within the last year, the Israeli, Saudi, and Indian governments have decided to offer incentives ranging from lifelong health insurance for the donor to a cash benefit.
Investment in the Russian economy was growing fast. Unfortunately, Russia’s rulers are not accustomed to leaving the country and the rest of the world for long without something surprising to gawk at.
We don’t care how it goes, just put an end to it.”
This property, it now seems, could be reclaimed by the state at any moment.
Killing Justice in Russia
These were often cases related to the war and ongoing violence in Chechnya or the growing neo-Nazi terror found on the streets of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other Russian cities.
The fact that Russian security forces are alleged to have been involved in some of the cases demonstrates the depth of the problem.
Fortunately, in the end, the opponents were forced to fight a will stronger than their own: the will of those who – after the abolition of slavery and torture – want to mark another turning point for civilization.
Some European Union countries wanted to push for complete abolition of the death penalty right away. I understand their position.
Not only does it work, but, above all, in some cases, it is the only way of moving forward.
But others were consistent with their lifetime commitments.
One should not underestimate the opposition that reforms continue to face among Greeks.
The Germans would have done better to admit that fiscal austerity is contractionary in the short run.
This will be necessary if the two sides are to arrive at a good bargain, rather than a bad one – or even an outright failure to cooperate, so that Greece effectively drops out of the euro.
Twelve years of unrelenting churn in neighboring Iraq is beginning to take a toll on the Kingdom.
Meanwhile, on the Kingdom’s southern border, Saudi leaders now face a very dangerous and uncertain situation in Yemen, the region’s weakest state, where Al Qaeda elements continue to require international attention.
It is a time when the US needs to work closely with the Saudis, be careful what it asks of them, and be sure that its policy toward them does not overload the region’s strategic circuits.
Yet, since that time, greenhouse-gas emissions have continued to soar.
Per capita carbon emissions in US coal states tend to be much higher than the national average.
That will certainly be true of domestic climate-change legislation.
First, he is negotiating side deals with holdout senators to cushion the economic impact on coal states and to increase US investments in the research and development, and eventually adoption, of clean-coal technologies.
This summer has given us one such example: the climate-change bill, for which President Barack Obama had pushed so hard, will not even be presented to the United States Senate, because it stands no chance of passage.
Exempting emerging markets from any commitments, as the Kyoto Protocol sought to do, no longer makes sense.
Indeed, the tax seems to fall mostly on foreign suppliers of coal (and to a lesser extend on foreign suppliers of hydrocarbons in the Middle East and Russia).
A planet composed of nation-states that in turn are dominated by special interest groups does not seem capable of solving this problem.
Some 50 insurgents died recently in an assault on Lashkar gar, the capital of Helmand province.
Moreover, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia hosted a Ramadan breakfast for the Afghan government and Taliban representatives.
But the Americans want a “surge,” and the US general commanding NATO forces in the country said last month that he needed three more brigades, some 15,000 troops in all, and Gates has asked the Europeans either to send or pay for them.
To retreat from its first major “out of area” mission would be a damaging blow for the alliance.
Rudyard Kipling got his arithmetic right in 1886:
In China, Mao Zedong united the country in 1949, while Deng Xiaoping was responsible for engineering its unprecedented economic rise.
As former US Ambassador to China Gary F. Locke reported in a speech early this year, the concept of equality before the law has deep historical roots.
If he succeeds, he, like Xi, will become his country’s next iconic leader.
To this end, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s cross-party “Pact for Mexico” could serve as a useful model.
Globalization, for example, has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, while contributing to social fragmentation and a massive increase in inequality, not to mention serious environmental damage.
Learning to live with slower growth will not be easy.
Innovation, spurred by talent, will determine success.
The role of the techno-polity is to steer the world toward positive outcomes.
अभी तक पश्चिम अफ्रीका सबसे बुरी सीमित किंतु नियमित हिंसा से बचा रहा है जिनसे मध्य अमेरिका औषधियों के पारगमन के दौरान ग्रस्त रहा है. लेकिन क्योंकि इस धंधे में भारी रकम दांव पर रहती है, अतः सुस्ती की कोई गुंजाइश नहीं है. पश्चिम अफ्रीका में कोकीन व्यापार का पैमाना तो उस क्षेत्र के अनेक देशों के मिले-जुले सरकारी बजट से भी कहीं अधिक है.
इसमें दवाओं की लत के उपचार व संबंधित स्वास्थ्य सेवाओं की स्थापना शामिल हैं. नुकसान को कम करने वाले उपाय भी लागू करने होंगे, यथा सुइयों की अदला-बदली के कार्यक्रम जो एचआईवी व दवाओं से जुड़ी मौतों को कम करने में अपनी उपयोगिता साबित कर चुके हैं. आज तक पूरे पश्चिम अफ्रीका में सेनेगल ही एकमात्र देश है जिसने अपने यहां सरकार द्वारा संचालित हानि-न्यूनीकरण कार्यक्रम को कुछ हद तक लागू किया है.
According to legend, Mori instructed each of his three sons to snap an arrow in half.
With real GDP growth around 4% in the first half of the year (though it did fall below 2% in the third quarter), the first arrow has already hit the bull’s eye – a performance worthy of an A+.
When Japanese firms operate at the frontier of industry, bureaucrats cannot choose the winners.
The most appropriate grade is therefore an “E” for effort.
Of course, not all emerging markets, according to this logic, are equally exposed.
But, given that these economies have chosen to adhere to a fixed exchange rate, the Fed cannot really be blamed for the fallout.
If all countries adopt this approach, the entire global economy benefits.
Expansionary monetary policy – the second of three so-called “arrows” of Abenomics, after fiscal stimulus – has brought down the unemployment rate to just 3.8%.
In any case, the success of monetary policy is difficult to deny.
A simpler solution would be to mobilize working-age women who already – or plan to – stay at home.
But, as long as Abe, backed by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, remains committed to his stated objectives, Japan’s economic future will remain bright.
In fact, such a large increase has seldom – if ever – been attempted, owing to the risk that it would spur consumers to spend before it takes effect, thereby reducing future consumption.
For more than two decades – a period characterized by chronic recession and deflation – Japan has retained its position as the world’s richest country in terms of net wealth abroad.
That is why Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda should respond accordingly if the tax increase has a deflationary impact.
That is certainly true.
After all, one dresses windows with what one knows the customer wants to see.
So it is no surprise that Putin is trying to place the Maidan movement beyond the pale by emphasizing the OUN’s passing, if bloody, alliance with the Nazis.
Putin’s claim that fascists have taken control in Kyiv is fundamentally bogus, while Russia’s despicable actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine are all too real.
On orders from Serbia’s government, Kosovo Serbs, who represent some 5% of the population, refuse to cooperate with Kosovo’s government and the EU mission.
Kosovo is, first of all, a European problem, and the EU has the primary responsibility to turn it into a success story.
Kosovo’s Original Sin
In 1999, the US led NATO into war against Slobodan Milosevic’s Serbia to end gross violations of the rights of Kosovo’s majority Albanians.
According to a recent BBC news investigation, however, UCK members abducted Serbs, Albanians, Roma, and others after NATO’s arrival.
Their blanket denials are no longer credible.
These Albanians fear that, in the absence of the rule of law, Kosovo will become a mafia state.
In 1999, Yeltsin picked Putin, who was then the little-known head of the FSB (formerly the KGB).
Putin’s own game of prime ministerial “musical chairs” does not reflect a desire to secure for himself a quiet position behind the scenes while someone else rules, for he knows all too well that the path from the Kremlin leads only to inner exile and the grave.
The outgoing Fradkov, surprisingly, put the matter best when he explained why he had resigned: with elections approaching, Putin needed a free hand.
The federal budget deficit has declined from 8.4% of GDP in 2011 to a predicted 2.9% of GDP for all of 2014.
On the contrary, “the disastrous turn toward austerity has destroyed millions of jobs and ruined many lives,” he argued, with the US Congress exposing Americans to “the imminent threat of severe economic damage from short-term spending cuts.”
On one hand, he has been the “conscience of a liberal,” rightly focusing on how government can combat poverty, poor health, environmental degradation, rising inequality, and other social ills.
We need the liberal conscience, but without the chronic budget deficits.
Hmm. In recent months, Krugman has repeatedly praised the US economic recovery under President Barack Obama, while attacking the United Kingdom’s record.

Thus, both countries have experienced moderately high and broadly similar growth rates since May 2010, when Cameron’s government took power.
The International Monetary Fund’s estimate of the output gap (see its World Economic Outlook database) for both countries does not suggest that, as of 2014, the UK is more cyclically depressed than the US.
Rather than lambasting Cameron while lauding Obama, Krugman should be praising both countries for their recoveries.
The AKP’s electoral setback has put an end to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s ambition of transforming Turkey’s parliamentary system of government into a presidential regime, which would have boosted his power enormously.
More important, although the AKP may be more willing than other Turkish parties to accommodate Kurdish concerns, it is unlikely to accept demands for devolution of powers to regional governments or any other decentralization program that strengthens the territorial autonomy of Kurdish areas.
Kuwait’s Parliamentary Revolution
Elections with universal suffrage, combined with a relatively free press, meant that the succession became a public issue, debated in the media and by academics for months as Sheikh Jaber was dying.
But the old rule of force and intrigue by which other Gulf rulers have been deposed has been replaced by a modern principle – the Al Sabah have surrendered their exclusive control over the succession to the will of Parliament, which alone could provide the legitimacy that the new Emir needs.
The Kuwaiti model may be risky, but the alternative – simply ignoring the need for change – could prove fatal.
The rules of political life in Kuwait have been worked out over 300 years – since this small area emerged as a self-contained polity.
Though political parties have not been legalized, they are nonetheless active in parliament and public life.
Islamist candidates were in an awkward position, seeking support from women voters, whose participation they opposed.
La Nausée Russe
His quest for eternal rule is driven not so much by a thirst for power as by a fear that he will one day be held accountable for his actions.
And, after Putin falls, the leaders of other authoritarian post-Soviet regimes – from Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko and Kazakhstan’sNursultan Nazarbayev to Ukraine’s would-be Putin, Viktor Yanukovych – will not survive in power for long.
If Putin unleashes his well-developed apparatus of coercion, he will have played his last remaining card.
Russia must rid itself, once and for all, of Putinism’s systemic corruption, lest the country be consumed by it.
In fact, the market economy can function only if the state does intervene.
The global dimension of this crisis surprisingly also has a positive side.
While important areas of economic policy are subject to rules that allow penal sanctions, the financial sector has a special status that is no longer acceptable.
The crisis has made clear that the provision of people’s elementary needs must not be made dependent on speculation and stock market curves.
To be effective, any stimulus program will need Europe’s nations to act in concert.
They should not stand in the way of compensation that includes stock options, or that otherwise create financial risks for their employees.
In the US, union failure to represent members’ interests adequately contributed to a major pension default at the Studebaker Corporation in 1963.
In today’s complex financial economies, representing workers’ interests is not so simple as battling with management for a bigger share of the pie. Unions should instead negotiate with management the same way top executives do with their boards of directors when their complex compensation packages are worked out.
In the early nineteenth century, a group of English textile workers known as the Luddites worried that new technologies like power looms and spinning frames would cost them their jobs.
Worldwide, one-third of employers surveyed complain that they are unable to find workers with the right skills for existing vacancies.
These trends are exacerbating income inequality.
The number of people aged 60 years and over will have tripled.
For it showed that the developed world, at least, was on track to solving the “economic problem” – the problem of scarcity that kept mankind tethered to a burdensome life of toil.
And, as we recover from the current recession, most experts expect this group to grow even larger.
Advertisers proclaim a single message: your soul is to be discovered in your shopping.
Without such efforts of social imagination, recovery from the current crisis will simply be a prelude to more shattering calamities in the future.
They entail the replacement of low- and medium-skilled workers with machines operated by a much smaller number of highly skilled workers.
By all indications, this trend is likely to continue, producing historically unprecedented levels of inequality and the threat of widespread social and political conflict.
Among all the new ideas that are pursued, only a few eventually become commercially successful.
Designing the right institutions for public venture capital can be difficult.
NEW YORK – Many people still believe that the attacks of September 11, 2001, were not just acts of political terrorism, but part of a cultural war, a clash of civilizations.
The response to 9/11 and to Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s recent encounter with an African chambermaid in a New York hotel have very little in common, except for one thing: once again, cultural conflict was invoked in a misleading way.
But even in the more liberal West – let alone in countries with less liberal traditions, such as Japan – culture comes to the rescue of the powerful more often than it protects the weak.
One cannot expect the law to solve all cultural conflicts.
Men who wish to maintain their control over women will no doubt continue to use culture and religious tradition to justify their dominance.
One reason why a dynastic succession is taking place is that Kim Il-sung created a national ideology, Juche, which mixes communism and autarky with a heavy dose of Confucian values.
After her father, Kim Il-sung, remarried, she was raised by various surrogates away from the family.
But Chan Giryok, who was Kim Jong-suk’s primary doctor and is now a doctor at Nagoya University in Japan, tells a different story.
Kim Kyong-hui’s intent to exercise power after her brother’s passing is supported by rumors that she helped arrange a traffic accident in June that killed Ri Je-gang, a senior party official and perceived guardian of Kim Jong-eun who reportedly attempted to oust Kim Kyong-hui and her close allies from power.
Lagarde’s Challenges
But other organizations have dealt with similar issues; the IMF needs to make the necessary changes, and, equally important, get the message out that the DSK incident was an aberration, not the tip of the proverbial iceberg.
With too-big-to-save countries like Spain in the clear, the debt of highly-indebted peripheral countries like Greece could be written down through interest waivers, maturity extensions, and debt exchanges.
It is not inconceivable that a number of emerging-market countries will get into trouble in the next few years.
Lagarde arrives to lead it at a difficult time.
Today, Africa’s rate of economic growth is second only to Asia’s.
In this context, the decision to retain the CFA franc, a freely convertible common currency that is pegged to the euro at a significantly overvalued exchange rate, is dubious.
Côte d’Ivoire, the franc zone’s leading economy, was a net rice exporter in the early 1970’s, until the country’s elite followed the advice of French expatriates to import rice rather than produce it.
Interfering with ideas, one might argue, is not in the same category as destroying precious objects, and elected officials tinkering with legislation cannot be compared to militants whose other activities include hacking off the hands and heads of innocent people.
They have decided that policy should be based solely on what they have already chosen to believe, rather than empirical evidence obtained through the scientific process.
Fact-based arguments, such as those in a recent editorial in Science magazine, should be enough to compel US leaders to change their approach.
Any major changes came not from deliberate decisions by central banks to reallocate reserves, but rather from the simple arithmetic of changing exchange rates: a stronger dollar raised the dollar’s share in total global reserves, while a weaker dollar reduced it.
Critics saw it as a case of two lame ducks propping each other up.
Germany had moved to current-account convertibility in 1958, but Japan only in 1964.
The lesson of the 1960’s suggests that a fully convertible renminbi could rapidly become a major international reserve currency.
An opening for talks between Serbia and Kosovo was created by a joint European Union-Serbia resolution at the United Nations, which sets out a framework for dialogue.
Indeed, as things now stand, Kosovo cannot join the EU, NATO, or the UN, two-thirds of whose members, including two permanent Security Council members (Russia and China), do not recognize its independence.
The case for partition is historical as well: these districts were part of Serbia until Tito redrew Yugoslavia’s internal borders in the 1950’s.
Serbia’s dynamic and mainly youthful mainstream political elite appears prepared to turn a corner and make sacrifices to secure Serbia’s long-term future in the EU (and possibly NATO).
NEW DELHI – America’s war in Afghanistan is approaching a tipping point, with doubts about President Barack Obama’s strategy growing.
And isn’t that what the CIA is doing already?
An American military exit from Afghanistan would not be a shot in the arm for the forces of global jihad, as many in the US seem to fear.
On the ground, it has little political and economic relevance, and it would be militarily impracticable to re-impose the line.


Obama has consistently been opposed to the trade agreement with Colombia.
He also accomplished, in a somewhat round-about way, another goal: showing the flag, so to speak, in the face of the mounting challenge from Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, who, thanks to virtually unlimited supplies of oil dollars and Cuban doctors and foot-soldiers, is riding high across Latin America.
Again, Bush left him hanging.
Conversely, if Bush cannot come up with enough Republican moderates in the US Senate – they are actually already there, probably &#45;&#45; and in the US House of Representatives, the letdown and resentment in Mexico (as well as everywhere in Central America, the Caribbean, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia) will be immense.
The US not only lost control of the OAS, an organization that generally serves US interests, but also failed to get last month’s Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata Argentina to endorse unanimously a declaration supporting America’s trade and political positions for the region.
Other countries – Bolivia, Chile, the countries of Central America – prefer regional solutions in which they have a clear and equal say.
2005 saw the return of seemingly buried territorial disputes, such as defining the maritime limits between Chile and Peru, as well as the revanchist pressures that are mounting in Bolivia for recovering access to the sea that was lost in the 19th century, an urge strengthened by Bolivia’s growing willingness to perhaps use its gas exports as a pressure point.
MEXICO CITY – Even as much of Latin America engages in almost hyperbolic celebrations over the renewed diplomatic ties between Cuba and the United States, the continent is facing two major challenges.
With Venezuela’s economy deteriorating sharply, and violence and human-rights violations proliferating, Maduro has been forced to call elections for this coming December. Polls indicate that, despite a rigged electoral system, his party will suffer serious setbacks.
Many other Latin American countries are in similar situations. In Chile, Michelle Bachelet is facing the most important political crisis of her presidency, and perhaps since the return of democracy in 1989.
Latin American countries are not starting from scratch.
It can kick-start a major drive to enact climate legislation across Latin America that would create low-carbon, economically resilient societies.
They do not need to dismantle existing environmental legislation, weaken incipient climate policies, or favor fossil fuels over clean energy sources to ensure prosperity.
In the 1930s, politicians of the moderate left, responding to the havoc wreaked on the region by the Great Depression, built the rudiments of a modern welfare state. In the 1960s, centrist politicians of different stripes – many of them Christian Democrats – struggled to find an alternative to the threat of armed revolution and the totalitarian politics of Fidel Castro’s Cuba.
Members of the new middle class suffer from the low quality of public services (particularly health and education); fret over job insecurity; are incensed by the persistence of discrimination in the labor market; and fume over jammed traffic and crime. But precisely because they have a hard time making ends meet, middle-class citizens have little patience for leaders who cause inflation and interest rates to skyrocket.
If Rousseff, plagued by scandals and a stalled economy, manages to complete her term, the social democrats look well-placed to win three years from now.
Uribe’s status as one of Latin America’s historic leaders was assured even before the rescue of Betancourt and the other hostages.
That backing appeared to be part of Chávez’s “Bolivarian” socialist revolution, which has used Venezuela’s petrodollars to bankroll left-wing governments in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Cuba in the hope of building up a regional anti-American alliance.
Cultural exchanges have increased, and Calderón is expected to visit Havana soon.
BOGOTA – Next month, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos will host the sixth Summit of the Americas.
The differences extend to other vital questions as well, such as their conception of democracy and their relations with the United States.
He has set aside Uribe’s overly ideological approach and combative rhetoric, instead adopting a pragmatic attitude aimed at fostering good relations with his counterparts.
Some critics believe that Santos’s intentions are too ambitious, or that they are unsustainable in the long run.
But his domestic policies, constrained by the recent severe earthquake and his own small mandate, differ only slightly from those of his predecessors, at least for now.
Sooner or later, this will constitute a major challenge to the hemispheric community.
As his term winds down (the next presidential elections are two years away), he will be even less inclined to involve Mexico in foreign adventures.
Latin America’s Commodity Windfall
The choice will depend on the characteristics of the country.
Fiscal consolidation was not, however, the result of formal fiscal rules.
Therefore, on a regional level, a large part of the additional resources were used to increase public spending, especially for social security, health, and education, in that order.
In any case, corruption alone is not the essential problem. Rather, it symbolizes and highlights underlying weaknesses in the operation of the state and its interactions with citizens and businesses.
Countries, with more independent and professional civil servants tend to have higher quality bureaucracies and less corruption.
One way to improve the administration of public programs is to go to the root and change the way governments provide goods and services and manage programs.
Contracting out some activities to nonprofit/nongovernmental organizations should be considered along with improved external monitoring.
At the very least, there is a crisis of confidence, and, at worst, that lack of confidence is well deserved.
Does being anti-American excuse all sins and justify all friendships? Maybe the answer is simpler: often, it is not shared ideas and values that bring individuals together, but rather power and money.
And perhaps she is right, as the agreement will certainly leave a historic stain on Argentina. Inexplicably, both governments have committed themselves to having their parliaments ratify the memorandum, which would elevate it to the status of an international treaty – thus making it impossible to change by a simple administrative measure.
Across the region, countless exchange-rate regimes have been tried – some succeeding, others failing abysmally.
Argentina adopted the hardest peg, introducing a quasi-currency board and fixing the exchange rate by law.
Coming from different experiences, most countries converged on the adoption of a floating exchange rate, many in the context of inflation targeting.
Yet, in the end, credibility collapsed because of the lack of flexibility.
Throughout the Hemisphere, paternalistic governments accustom people to receiving just enough to survive instead of participating in society.
United by the right to vote, Latin Americans remain divided by poverty.
State monopolies are sold to friends who then become multibillionaires, like Mexico’s Carlos Slim.
Governments that don’t need to broaden their tax base have few incentives to respond to the needs of their people.
Indeed, China’s rulers have already stated that the new exchange-rate system will aim at maintaining currency stability.
Sadly, results are not much better in reading ability; again, the Latin American nations were at the bottom of the 40-country sample.
In addition, paying teachers according to performance must become the norm, while ineffective teachers should be dismissed.
But that is not happening this time.
Whereas Chile, for example, recorded a slight fiscal deficit in 2003, by 2006 it boasted an almost 8%-of-GDP surplus.
Latin America’s Forbidden Debates
At the same time that political changes helped spread democracy across Latin America, structural economic reforms were strengthened.
By contrast, the terror index for Western Europe was 1.1.
Indeed, it may be that the framework for a state that can preside over a true democracy has yet to be created.
Today, Latin American states need political agreements that protect them from becoming the victims of both North American unilateralism and the global economy.
At first glance, the almost constant bombardment of integration proposals in Latin America makes it appear as if the region’s presidents are trying to outdo each other in seeing who can come up with the greatest number of proposals.
While the Unasur proposal may have been formulated in a more rigorous way than other initiatives, its failure to contemplate trade integration means that there is nothing to tie member states together beyond political will.
Although the inclusion of all Latin American states goes some way towards repairing the weakened Brazilian-Mexican axis, and creates a new and more positive environment for future political coordination, this new organization is unlikely to contribute much to actual regional integration.
The basis for this idea is that the rise to power of Lula da Silva in Brazil, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Néstor Kirchner in Argentina, Tabaré Vásquez in Uruguay, and, most recently, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Michelle Bachelet in Chile show a socialist trend . But are all of them old-style leftists?
Even Bolivia’s government should not be regarded as a reincarnation of the continent’s old populism.
But they go no further: Castro is fine for photo opportunities, but not for policy advice.
BUENOS AIRES – In 2009, Latin America scored an unrecognized achievement: the global economic crisis did not affect the continent as dramatically as it did other regions.   Politically and institutionally, however, Latin America’s weaknesses and perils worsened.
Moreover, there has been an alarming increase in regional tensions.
Finally, Colombia’s unresolved and cruel conflict persists.
Waves of immigrants, driven from their homes by poverty and desperation, blend one nation’s struggles into another’s.
Our nation may be small, but our commitment to improving the well-being of this region is anything but.
Our resources are scarce.
They must be built with the knowledge that no fence, wall, or even an ocean or a continent can truly divide us from the problems of others.
But not this time ­– at least so far.
As a result, the new generation of leaders cannot introduce drastic structural reforms, badly needed in several countries, in a way that jeopardizes macroeconomic stability – without which none of their promises can be fulfilled.
If no adequate provisions are made to sustain global competitiveness, the economic, social, and political consequences could be dire.
Chile’s economy has performed well over the past two years, despite low world copper prices; but its annual growth rate is nowhere near that of the previous 25 years.
This year, Chile will hold its sixth consecutive democratic election, with two women – former Labor Minister Evelyn Matthei and former center-left President Michelle Bachelet (both daughters of high-ranking military officers) – currently leading in the polls.
But there is a more fundamental issue at play that stems from the accumulated imperfections of representative democracy in countries where social and economic conditions are less than ideal.
For the first time, all the costs and benefits of more than 40 different policy options were laid out side-by-side.
Latin American and Caribbean governments need to know how to raise educational quality and combat domestic violence.
They are relatively cheap and have benefits between five and 19 times greater than the costs.
At the bottom of the list, the expert panel gave very low rankings to the idea of restricting alcohol sales (as a proposed solution to health problems), educational voucher programs, and prison drug treatment and reintegration programs.
Banks are creatively tapping into migrant worker remittances, multiple-family households, and other previously overlooked sources of potential income and creditworthiness.
To their benefit, Latin American governments have applied the lessons of the past.
Latin America’s low personal debt levels have created an opportunity to build a constructive culture of borrowing while expanding economic opportunity.
At the same time, expanded access to credit has supported a building boom to meet vast untapped demand.
Inequality has increased, poverty has been reduced only slightly at best, employment remains stubbornly low, corruption, violence, crime, and political gridlock continue unabated, and foreign investment and free-trade agreements with the US have yet to deliver the goods.
Actual policies, with the passing exception of Argentina’s negotiation with its international creditors – and the IMF, in particular – are remarkably similar to those of their predecessors.
The MIT economists Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, among others, identify the Second Machine Age with the rise of new automation technologies and artificial intelligence.
As they adjust to lower prices for oil, metals, and grain – and the eventual upturn in global interest rates – they will have to pursue productivity-enhancing reforms.
Latin American businesses can change this by emulating their counterparts in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, which have research contracts with leading public universities.
He is now working on Duolingo, a free language-learning platform that aspires to coordinate the translation of Wikipedia’s entire content into several major languages.
Both aggregate data and micro examples confirm that the world has become more tightly linked, with cross-border flows increasing in scope and complexity – and embracing a larger number of countries and participants within them.
By contrast, the cross-border flow of people, measured by the percentage of people living outside their country of birth, is small, hovering around 2.7% since 1980.
Flows of low-value, labor-intensive goods like apparel are declining as a share of global flows, while flows of R&D-intensive products, such as pharmaceuticals and business services, are gaining share.
Despite strong exports, South Korea and Japan rank 20th and 21st out of 85 countries, because they lag on immigration and cross-border Internet traffic.
BERKELEY – The American public’s attitude toward government, especially toward the federal government, recalls a classic scene in Monty Python’s “Life of Brian.”
All of this is good news.
This can happen – indeed, in the US under President Barack Obama’s leadership it is already happening – in many different ways.
Some state and local governments are experimenting with new “pay-for-performance” contracts – sometimes called social impact bonds (SIBs) – to promote social innovation.
As former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently observed, philanthropists should test innovative policy ideas and then rely on government money to implement them widely.
Household consumption accounts for more than two-thirds of aggregate demand, and consumption growth depends on income growth for the bottom 90%.
Nearly half of the respondents indicated that, when possible, they prefer to invest in technology or outsource to third parties and hire part-time workers, none of whom receive much additional training or have a stake in their company’s long-term success.
From 1979 to 2012, the real median wage increased by only 5%.
Some 20 years ago, Alan Blinder of Princeton University corralled a number of economists, including me, to examine existing studies on the link between profit-sharing and productivity.
Russians seem to care less about political freedom than they do about social welfare - pensions, domestic violence, children's rights, or police brutality.
That fight is not over, but after my intervention, Moscow's authorities must take into account the public's negative attitude to their effort to quash this publication.
Many observers nonetheless insist that those under criminal investigation should be released on bail instead of being kept in prison.
Because concepts of human rights remain rudimentary, the best that can be hoped for is that awareness will slowly begin to take hold.
Revaluation of the renminbi would make it more expensive for foreign firms to establish themselves (or expand) in China – the world’s most dynamic market – and would render exports of foreign affiliates, which account for 54% of total exports, less competitive internationally.
A renewed renminbi appreciation would boost China’s outward FDI growth even further by lowering the cost of overseas assets for Chinese firms, which operate in a fairly competitive market and have strong cash reserves from both retained earnings and large-scale state credit allocations.
Chinese FDI, like all FDI, can provide host countries with a bundle of tangible and intangible assets needed for economic growth and development. While a significant part of China’s outward FDI initially takes the form of trade-supporting FDI, it can be expected to lead relatively quickly to some production being shifted out of China, including to the US and Europe, thereby possibly reducing exports from China.
Compounding this trend, rising powers such as China and India place great value on national sovereignty and non-interference in domestic affairs.
At the other extreme are policies that implicate the “global commons”: the outcome for each country is determined not by domestic policies, but by (the sum total of) other countries’ policies.
Consider agricultural subsidies, bans on genetically modified organisms, or lax financial regulation.
Different types of policies call for different responses at the global level.
Organizations need both, but leaders are more important.
Good leaders must manage their inner circle of advisers to ensure an accurate flow of information and influence. They must avoid the “emperor’s trap” of hearing only about the beauty of their new clothes.
Secretary of State Colin Powell’s chief of staff described the situation as furtive and camouflaged by the inefficiency of the formal decision-making process.
Roosevelt never thought that staffs had a monopoly on judgment or information, and has been described as seeking advice from anybody he could: cabinet members, congressmen, newspaper columnists, interest groups, citizens, and friends.
LONDON – Over the last few years, thinking on happiness has undergone a sea change. Until recently, it seemed sensible to assume that our happiness was determined by factors such as luck, fate, or genes that are beyond our control.
Being in a country at peace does not of itself make everyone happy; but it removes many obvious causes of unhappiness.
It is impossible, of course, to eliminate suffering.
First, America’s national story is different in essence from those of Western European nations.
As a result, Britain, France, and The Netherlands contain deeply entrenched subcultures of alienated, radicalized Muslim youth.
As long as there is a Church of England, if you are Jewish or Muslim or Sikh, there is a subtle level at which you will simply not feel fully English.
Learning from Crises
Internally, bankers had enormous potential to benefit from risky moves, but were insulated from the costs of failure.
But many systemically important banks became bigger rather than smaller as a result of the crisis.
But hints of new fiscal imprudence or of backsliding on long-term debt consolidation and reduction can drive up borrowing costs dramatically.
The political scientist E.E. Schattschneider’s analysis of the process was influential in transferring responsibility for trade measures from the US Congress to the President.
Both are volatile democracies where any political question can provoke not just intense debate, but also the threat of violence.
The personal freedoms that Lebanese citizens enjoy give their country a special resilience, and its cultural dynamism is the envy of young people throughout the Middle East.
Each major faction is represented in government.
Instead, he will lead the National Council for Strategic Policy, an institution charged with overseeing domestic security, but whose authority remains unclear.
But if Iraq’s leaders can create enough near-term stability to combine Lebanon’s openness and entrepreneurial energy with the revenue that comes from development of the country’s vast oil reserves – an advantage that Lebanon’s leaders can only envy – Iraq might one day offer citizens of neighboring states something they don’t have: a hopeful model for the future.
In the wake of fiercely contested presidential elections, large numbers of voters in each country questioned the legitimacy of the outcome.
But the good news for Mexicans is that their country’s political institutions have proven far more stable than did Ukraine’s.
A recent poll in the newspaper Reforma found that Calderon would now defeat him by 19 percentage points.
To be sure, political and market volatility in a broad range of emerging-market economies will continue.
And, finally, there is consideration of what lessons should be learned from it.
And now, exactly 20 years after the Berlin Wall came down, we are well into the third phase – the debate over why the Cold War ended when it did and how it did.
But this alone would not have been enough; indeed, the Cold War could well have turned hot if Western strategy had consisted only of military competition and confrontation.
Such an approach served the world well during the Cold War; it could do the same now.
But the demand side was heavily regulated, owing to a rule that clubs could field no more than two foreign players in any single game.
In Spain, all but three championships since 1985 have been won by either Real Madrid or Barcelona.
The average winning margin among the top eight World Cup national teams has steadily decreased, from more than two goals in the 1950’s, to about 1.5 goals in the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s, and only 0.88 goals in the 2002 World Cup.
The same rule could be applied to other activities.
Well, for starters, he could suggest that she keep sweets out of the house to avoid temptation, or that she put aside part of one of each day’s meals for a midnight snack.
Calories do count; the physics of energy works even in the human body.
Not much is known about it, but it is probably not a good idea to swim – as I do every morning – with coffee in my stomach. Yet my swimming time is definitely better after having coffee.
I do not know the right approach for each person; the point is to liberate people to find their own path, not to chain them to some new “healthy” protocol that may or may not suit them.
It was always clear that the timing of America’s departure from Iraq might not be its choice – unless it wanted to violate international law once again.
That is the key point: the surge was supposed to provide space for a political settlement, which would provide the foundations of long-term stability.
But things keep getting worse: the deficit for 2009 alone is expected to be more than a half-trillion dollars, excluding the costs of financial bail-outs and the second stimulus package that almost all economists now say is urgently needed.
But the failures in Iraq are a matter of strategy, not troop strength.
But, at end of the day, no currency can defy the laws of economic gravity.
But they seem to show that, despite sharper rhetoric in Sino-US relations, China has continued lending to the US in order to keep its export machine going and avoid booking large foreign-exchange losses.
But this implies that China must allow the renminbi to float freely, and thus to appreciate.
Moreover, while exchange-rate policy is not an instrument for dealing with China’s domestic inflation, renminbi appreciation would certainly help the government meet its goal of keeping the annual rate below 4% in 2011.
Some analysts predict that only half of Britain’s MPs will be returned in next year’s election.
And artists can benefit not merely from studio courses, but also from art appreciation lessons that introduce them to the full repertoires and pallets of past masters.
“Do” refers to action and requires both training and fieldwork.
Bureaucratic entrepreneurs, on the other hand, take advantage of such opportunities to adjust and promote policies.
They must also better understand the nature of the contextual intelligence they will need to educate their hunches and sustain strategies of smart power.
Just to keep up with the inflow of young people into the labor market, Arab economies will have to generate 100 million new jobs over the next 10 years, which will be impossible if education remains impoverished.
Education is also important in the Arab context because of its special status in Islam, which, like Judaism and Christianity, is a religion of the book.
But they did not have the resources to keep up with their own growing populations.
Saudi Arabia recognized it in the 1970’s as it sought to expand its influence, and over the years the Kingdom has funded thousands of schools and colleges that teach its stringent brand of Wahhabi Islam.
The greater risk, I felt, would have been to leave these children sitting idle, losing their hopes and aspirations, or, worse, being forced into child labor or drawn in by radical ideologies.
Indeed, despite strong demand, lack of financing hampered our ability to increase enrollment considerably.
Each of these challenges will cost money, which is why we hope that, as we approach the beginning of the school year in September, the international community will urgently increase its financial support to Lebanon.
The alternative is leaving hundreds of thousands of children on the streets, languishing in informal settlements with an uncertain future.
Although the March 14 coalition already controlled Parliament, its majority had been repeatedly attacked as the result of a severely skewed election law.
Moving forward, the immediate challenge will be to form the next government.
However, since then, Lebanon has put together a coalition government, regained security and stability, weathered the global economic crisis, and now organized a largely free and fair election.
Both Lebanon and Iraq comprise ancient communities living within the borders of states outlined in the 20th century.
Moreover, coexistence and cooperation among the various communities is enshrined as a basic principle in Lebanon’s constitution.
This could be described as a temporary advisory parliament, or ‘Shura Council,’ but it should include hundreds of figures from throughout the country and they should be selected through the Governing Council and interim Government after nationwide consultations.
Lebanon’s Moment of Decision
It has been vacant since September 2004 when Lahoud, backed by Syria, forced an extension of his six-year term on the Lebanese parliament, which elects the president.
On January 23, the Security Council issued a statement expressing regret that the conduct of “free and fair presidential elections” had not yet been carried out in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1559, which was passed on the eve of Lahoud’s extension.
Once the president’s illegitimacy is formally acknowledged by a majority of parliamentarians, all his acts will be considered beyond his constitutional powers, and the process of electing a new president will be firmly on track.
But it also brought about a new political accord, negotiated in Doha, Qatar, providing for election of a president after a long stalemate, formation of a national unity government, a new election law, and a return to a national dialogue over relations between the state and non-state actors, particularly Hezbollah.
Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran, were motivated by two concerns: fear of the next Israeli attack, which Hezbollah believes is inevitable, and concern over Syrian-Israeli peace talks that, if successful, could leave Hezbollah without its main bridge to Iran.  Hezbollah has been rearming and redeploying since the 2006 war; the actions of May further consolidate its position in and around Beirut.
The Doha agreement might allow a number of months, or years, of relative calm.
But one of its purposes was to obtain the Syrian-backed Hezbollah’s support for an IMF-style recovery program.
The issue is not so much where the funds will come from as the amount itself.
Yet this did not deter Turkey from organizing the Third Turkish-Arab Forum on July 10, 2010, with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.
That earthquake could prove monumental, depending on how Hezbollah responds to any indictment over Hariri's murder.
To its credit, South Korea has built a relatively gender-equal society.
The problem is that the rate drops sharply from 71% to 57% among women in their 30’s, as inflexible working environments and a lack of affordable childcare undermine their ability to continue investing in their careers.
The current system tends to reinforce gender roles, encouraging children to follow culturally framed paths, instead of nurturing their individual interests and potential.
The Fed has signaled that its federal funds rate will remain near 0%, at least as long as unemployment exceeds 6.5% and inflation expectations remain well anchored.
Moreover, since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the region’s emerging economies have increased their holdings of foreign-exchange reserves, and now possess more than half of the world’s total.
Such swaps should help Asian countries to cope with currency turmoil in the wake of a Fed policy reversal.
And, given China’s rise, it is clearly in America’s interest to maintain a balance of economic power in Asia.
To be sure, universal primary education has nearly been achieved.
The logical conclusion is that efforts to promote more inclusive economic growth and improve education systems can raise enrollment among young people in developing countries and reduce disparities between genders and among social groups.
Though academic performance is determined largely by family inputs and students’ individual talents, other factors, such as the amount of school resources available to students, also play an important role, as do various other school inputs, such as teacher quality, class size, expenditure per pupil, and instruction time.
What Comes After Lee Kuan Yew?
But Lee’s own actions suggest that he harbored doubts.
What eventually became clear was that under no circumstances could Lee Kuan Yew countenance one particular word or concept: nepotism.
There is no current risk to Singapore’s political stability, and the younger Lee is only 63 years old; he could remain in office for a long time to come.
In February, the European Parliament adopted a resolution to outlaw the purchase of sexual services from anyone below the age of 21.
Conversely, in more than 50 countries, a girl under 15 can be married off if her parents consent to it, even if she does not.
Over the past 40 years, expert committees convened by the World Health Organization have agreed that sexual health includes physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being in relation to sexuality, and is underpinned by respect for human rights and individual autonomy.
It is these rights and responsibilities that Canada and other countries should be enshrining in their laws.
While historical discussion won’t be out of bounds in Spain, even banning ceremonies celebrating bygone days may go a step too far.
After Franco’s death in 1975, Spain, too, treated its recent history with remarkable discretion.
Now, under President Roh Moo-hyun, a new Truth and Reconciliation Law has not only stimulated a thorough airing of historical grievances, but has also led to a hunt for past collaborators.
But even if extreme caution is sometimes understandable, it may not be wise, as a matter of general principle, to ban abhorrent or simply cranky views of the past.
Observers confirm that infringements of the electoral rules were but minor.
What is legal, they think, is also legitimate.
In Canada, for example, it would be risky to overlook the special interests of Quebec.
Without legitimacy, there can be no stability in any political system, and without elections – that is, an explicit expression of popular consent to the holders of power – there can be no legitimacy.
Are bank managers ignorant?
In the current crisis, three moral-hazard effects are particularly important.
Often, securities are created that are backed by sophisticated portfolios containing good and bad assets whose true risk cannot easily be assessed.
Banks often oppose higher equity-asset ratios, because equity capital is more expensive than debt capital. But this is precisely because of the lemon effect.
Counter-cyclical policy can moderate these negative effects, but it cannot undo the damage or accelerate the recovery beyond fairly strict limits.
The impact on consumption will largely have to wait until balance sheets, for both households and businesses, are more fully repaired.
Benefits should be expanded and extended for a limited, discretionary period.
From a political point of view, the crisis has been portrayed as a failure of financial regulation, with irresponsible lending fueling a rapid rise in systemic risk.
The most dangerous consequences of Morsi’s overthrow became apparent on July 8, when security forces in Cairo opened fire on some of the tens of thousands of his supporters who had turned out to call for his reinstatement, killing more than 50 people.
Against this background, future progress depends on three major factors.
The new government needs to convince the middle class to accept a cutback in energy subsidies, which now consume 30% of public expenditures, and ensure better regulation of competition and democratization of credit.
Both Mansour and Beblawi can rise above short-term temptations, because they will not contest the upcoming elections.
But a remark by one mining company executive from a developing country caught the spirit of change.
Overall, the private sector in Europe and America has been unable to create many good jobs since the beginning of the current century.
One very senior government official of a northern European country did not even put down his fork when interrupted by an earnest dinner companion who pointed out that many Spaniards now eat out of garbage cans. They should have reformed earlier, he replied, as he continued to eat his steak.
SINGAPORE – When the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy last week, it became the largest such filing in United States history.
One factor that has helped cities is the nature of twenty-first century life.
Instead, innovation is increasingly based on mixing and matching knowledge from different specializations.
This process of urban growth, however, is about to unravel.
As its population begins to shrink, it may even be worthwhile to shut down unviable cities and consolidate.
Second, the intervention once again highlights the strategic insignificance of the European Union, which is promoting a “comprehensive strategy” for Mali and the whole region in order to avoid the crucial question: Under what conditions will Europe use force?
(The State Department even went so far as to warn France and Great Britain not to vote for United Nations Resolution 1973, which authorized intervention.)
Following from above thus has operational and symbolic significance.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is known to criticize France for being less than enthusiastic about European political union.
The Bush administration’s response to the hurricane confirmed the suspicion among blacks that, while they might send their boys to fight America’s wars, they had not only been left behind in America’s prosperity, but that there was neither understanding nor concern when they needed it most.
He recently signed a lavish infrastructure bill that included, among other payoffs to political supporters, an infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska.
Bush simply forgot the poor – the tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands, who simply did not have the resources to pay for their own evacuation. 
Perhaps America, and especially Bush, will be persuaded to join the rest of the world in the fight against poverty and to protect our planet’s environment.
Nevertheless, whereas the taxes at the national level in the United States are equal to around 20% of GNP, in the Nordic countries the ratio is more than 30%.
The US spends less in the public sector, but it taxes even less than it spends.
The Nordic countries are not “socialist” economies, based on state ownership and planning, but “social welfare” economies, based on private ownership and markets, with public provision of social protection. Importantly, they invest heavily in higher education and in science and technology, so they remain at the cutting edge of high-technology industries.
Of course, it seemed to take somewhat longer for news of the extent of the disaster to reach the Crawford, Texas, ranch of President Bush.
They did ask one thing: a reduction of tariff barriers and greater access to markets abroad.
But in one area, global warming, we have already received an early warning.
Unless we learn how to respect it, we will all miss the boat.
These rules of thumb work (at least tolerably so) as a result of evolution.
This is clearly maladaptive, and it explains why the massive injections of liquidity by advanced-country central banks are failing to jump-start economies and create more jobs.
These actions are usually justified as policies for boosting domestic demand, but they end up fueling a surrogate, low-grade currency war.
Even if the employment subsidy were offered only for, say, one year, firms would be tempted to use more labor during this time.
NEW YORK – Of all major world regions, Europe has worked the hardest to implement policies aimed at countering human-caused climate change.
Dangerous changes in climate have already begun.
But this technology, called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), is not yet proven on a large scale.
Even if the US economy shifts from coal to natural gas, America’s coal will probably be exported for use elsewhere in the world.
Part of the tax revenue should be channeled into subsidies for new low-carbon energy sources like wind and solar, and to cover the costs of developing CCS.
Moreover, the madness of war has been clearly demonstrated to all, and, once the current fighting is over, both sides are now more likely to be cautious about actions that might push their peoples and countries into war once more.
More than 170 Palestinians have died since the violence began in June.
They are now likely to be the first ones set free.
They need to work together through negotiations to solve problems that simply cannot and should not be solved by brute force.
Within the eurozone, cumulative GDP growth since 2008 has ranged from –23.6% in Greece to 5.2% in Slovakia; outside the eurozone, it has ranged from –4.1% in the United Kingdom to 12.5% in Poland.
At the heart of the European project lies a commitment to the single market, the subsidiarity principle, and the “four freedoms,” as well as other traditional liberties such as freedom of speech and religion.
It is against this background that the risks inherent in different kinds of reform should be assessed.
This year’s Nobel laureates in economics are two scholars whose life work explored alternative approaches.
We have much to learn, too, from economic history.
Last month, Soros assembled a remarkable group of economic luminaries, from across the spectrum of the profession –theory to policy, left to right, young and old, establishment and counter-establishment—to discuss the need and prospects for such an initiative, and how it might best proceed.
Until it does and international support is conditioned on Afghan progress in realizing goals set by Afghans, the country’s state institutions will continue to lose credibility.
Democracy and the rule of law could conceivably be an effective alternative to what the Taliban offer, but the government cannot credibly claim to provide either, not to mention basic services, on a consistent basis.
But the international community is not obliged to finance official corruption.
Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries (so-called “Annex I countries”) have the right to purchase certificates of carbon sequestration from reforestation projects undertaken in developing countries and use them to offset up to 1% of their 1990 greenhouse-gas emissions from industry, transport and housing.
So why not liberalize the carbon market as well – a move that would help, not hurt, domestic producers?
Once the dust settles, China, India, Brazil, South Korea, and a handful of other “emerging” nations will be able to exercise greater influence over the way that multilateral economic institutions are run, and will be in a better position to push for reforms that reflect their interests. 
The only effective response is counter-cyclical capital-account management: discouraging foreign borrowing during economic upswings and preventing capital flight during downswings.
The administrative difficulties in implementing a Tobin tax are not insurmountable, as long as all major advanced countries go along.
The largest developing nations – China, India, and Russia – will need to shoulder some of the burden of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.
Let Finance Skeptics Take Over
Even when not formally designated as such, central banks have become the guardians of financial-market sanity.
This will no doubt change as a result of the crisis, even if Bernanke remains at the helm.
Regulation is at best a partial remedy for such problems.
In fact, neither expectation was fulfilled.
It is time that finance skeptics began to take over.
According to this view, there was no conspiracy, but a great social revolution that, by virtue of a powerful internal logic, brought to power workers, peasants, and the Bolshevik party, which represented their will.
Nobody talked about the revolution leaders’ mistakes, doubts, hesitations, and ignorance.
Putin also stopped near the common gravestone of generals and officers of the “White” armies. “We are children of the same mother – Russia,” said Putin, “and it’s time for us all to unite.”
Historically, failure to protect against inflation or deflation has helped spur calamitous outcomes.
The open interest recently was 355 contracts, with a notional value of €355 million.
This would help reframe public thinking, which is all a government really needs to do.
What if people really got used to expressing quantities in baskets?
Not without reform.
To avoid rewards for short-term performance and focus on long-term results, pay structures need to be re-designed.
As a result, executives were not exposed to the potential negative consequences that large losses could bring about for preferred shareholders, bondholders, and the government as a guarantor of deposits.
As a result, no one doubts Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s legitimacy.
There can be no doubt that Abbas was democratically elected.
However, all external observers know very well that this is not the case, even if Abbas can undoubtedly succeed in reducing the level and number of attacks.
Networked Development
And in the Networked Society, we have an obligation to ensure that we exploit mobile and broadband technologies not just for collaboration and entertainment, but also for sustainable development.
Evidence of this can be seen in the Millennium Villages Project, where mobile communications have had a particularly significant impact on health care: improved response times to emergencies, reduced isolation, and better training and equipment for health-care workers.
Two forums are making great strides.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Leviathan faced an uphill public-relations battle.
The story, akin to Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ambitious 1962 masterpiece One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, steadily indicts the corruption of state power – a power ever-willing to kill and to align itself with an even more corrupt power, the Orthodox Church.
Indeed, Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky recently criticized the film for its darkness and pessimism.
George Orwell neatly summarized why: “All propaganda is a lie even when it's telling the truth."
No government, rich or poor, can ignore the imperative to encourage economic growth.
Like the dramatic changes once wrought by mass production, there is similar potential in the development and application of 3D printing, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and other resource-efficient technologies.
By adopting new economic models, their large but finite reserves will not be rendered useless; they will simply last longer.
By Freedom House’s count, more than 60% of the world’s countries are electoral democracies – regimes in which political parties compete and come to power in regularly scheduled elections – up from around 40% in the late 1980s.
They may be comparatively few in number, but they can mobilize material resources if they do not get their way.
In return, the masses – or their representatives – agree not to expropriate the elite.
One set of circumstances that favors liberal democracy is the absence of clear-cut ethnic or other identity cleavages among the non-elites.
Alternatively, perhaps liberal democracy has little to do with the balance of power among social groups and their strategic motivations.
The space business was the preserve of a few governments, plus a number of large cost-plus contractors who lived in symbiosis with their government customers. 
And it's a huge opportunity for NASA as well as for space exploration and science.
I'm not suggesting that private companies should be allowed to kill people, but they can take risks (with people who understand the risks they are taking), which governments cannot.  Of course, they are also incentivized not to take risks; any start-up space company that carelessly kills someone will probably also kill itself.
Their scorn has also extended to the second part of the budget, a program that normally they would have liked: bringing back to the US jobs that currently go to Russians.
Look around you. There are lots of organizations like that, waiting to be liberated, their employees yearning to breathe free.
She was “sure that it [would] be used by Pyongyang and our own government in attempting to make political points.”
Rock music was severely restricted in Communist dictatorships, just as jazz was in Nazi Germany, for all the Platonic reasons: uncontrolled passions were seen as a threat to the perfect order of the state.
Obviously, Dvorak and Wagner are not Zappa and the Stones.
There are plenty of rock bands in China already.
Milton Friedman was a giant among modern social thinkers for at least two reasons.
Any attempt to use expansionary government policies to drive unemployment below a certain level, they demonstrated, would fuel inflationary expectations and undermine both economic growth and employment.
For example, he pioneered the idea of school vouchers, arguing that private competition would ensure better educational performance than government systems.
Libya After Qaddafi
According to the same study, which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between 1900 and 2006, the likelihood of democratic transition within five years following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3%, compared to 51% when campaigns were unarmed.
A move by army officers in Tripoli against Qaddafi and his sons might end the conflict, with military commanders getting the credit – and the political capital.
The fourth scenario is partition, with the old three-province, Ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned: Cyrenaica (east), Fezzan (south), and Tripolitania (west).
This is a far cry from recent years, when staying at a Libyan-owned hotel would make you subject to a US felony charge!
Of course, it is unrealistic and naïve to expect that the changes now underway in Libya will result in a rapid transition to European-style democracy.
DOHA – “They are armed, I am not going to fight a losing battle and kill my men over a demolished shrine,” said Fawzi Abd al-‘Aali, the former Libyan interior minister, before he “resigned” last August.
“They should not come near the Shariah. It should be above the constitution, and not an article for referendum.”
The National Guard, headed by the former LIFG deputy leader, Khaled al-Sharif, absorbed more than 30 brigades, mostly from the west and southwest.
One of the Muslim Brothers’ Web sites includes such a statement, and Libya’s Grand Mufti, Sheikh Sadeq al-Gheriani, also condemned the attack.
The LIA has always been exceptional; indeed, several indices that rank SWFs on transparency, accountability, and governance issues have traditionally given only Iran a lower ranking.
In this case, the Libyans did not respond by withdrawing a large amount of funds, but that could happen in the future.
Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns, such as Libya-Italy relations, or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices.
Other members were previously political prisoners or exiled dissidents.
Instead of injecting new blood into senior government posts during his 42 years in power, Qaddafi merely shuffled cronies between ministries.
Such trials were held in revolutionary courts staffed by Qaddafi zealots and operating outside the formal judiciary.
With the NTC confronting so many dilemmas with so little time, it must concentrate on a small number of key issues that can be resolved before it hands over power.
The NTC has preserved much of the institutional paralysis and knee-jerk behavior typical of Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi’s overthrown regime.
With no access to Libyan assets frozen abroad, it frequently paid salaries weeks in arrears.
When a colonel recently asked NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel-Jalil why he has not moved to merge the militias into a national army, Abdel-Jalil replied, “I head the legislative branch.
Bureaucrats lament ministerial dithering.
But Abdel-Jalil named no specific foreign powers and offered no proof to support his allegations, which sounded much like Qaddafi’s frequent rants against “imperialist-Zionist plots.”
By “better,” I mean better ethically, not materially.
But socialism, in its classical form, failed – as it had to.
This made him a fervent free trader.
Their choices are framed by their societies’ dominant culture.
It was only in the eighteenth century that greed became morally respectable. It was now considered healthily Promethean to turn wealth into money and put it to work to make more money, because by doing this one was benefiting humanity.
The evidence suggests that economies would be more stable and citizens happier if wealth and income were more evenly distributed.
And from that remnant of the Biblical story of creation sprung the notion of a tree of life, alongside major concepts such as gradualism (the view that speciation does not occur abruptly) and the idea that minor selection pressures can, over time, have a profound effect on improved fitness.
The unidentified genetic sequences pose a problem, because it is not known whether vehicles other than viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes exist.
But the current classification of the domains of life is based on the ribosome – the production apparatus of proteins – which does not exist in these viruses.
Today, Darwin’s theory of evolution is more a hindrance than a help, because it has become a quasi-theological creed that is preventing the benefits of improved research from being fully realized.

Everyone has cancer cells every day, but usually the body deals with them, using strength gained from eating right, exercise, and social engagement.
In my case, they could have gone something like this: assume you have a 70% chance of survival (defined as no recurrence for five years) if you simply have the tumor removed. Radiation and chemotherapy treatments can reduce recurrence by a further 30%.
Whether we are choosing what to eat or how much to exercise, or trying to assess our chances of a specific condition, the numbers make it feel real and immediate.
Although it is very similar to a natural bacterium from which it was largely copied, the creators put distinctive strings of DNA into its genome to prove that it is not a natural object.
But the work has taken 20 scientists a decade to complete, at an estimated cost of $40 million, and commercial investors are an obvious source for such funds.
The most exciting prospect held out by Venter, however, is a form of algae that can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to create diesel fuel or gasoline.
Presumably, our attempt at resurrecting it was pathetic and hopeless.
The Bhagwati-Sutherland Report amply documents that much has already been agreed upon in all the major areas.
These rules are then advertised as “avant garde,” implying that the PTAs are the “vanguard” of new rules.
In the Middle East, democratic development has been lagging.
Most encouraging is that producing countries themselves are beginning to seize the initiative.
Two-thirds of the world’s most impoverished people live in about 60 developing or transition countries that depend on oil, mining, or gas revenues.
The EITI still has a long way to go, but it is one of the most effective vehicles available for achieving a global standard of disclosure and accountability.
No fewer than 210 Congolese nongovernmental organizations, including those enjoying the widest recognition and respect across the country, recently joined in challenging President Joseph Kabila’s attempt to take control of the National Assembly (the lower house of Parliament) that came into office after historic elections in 2006.
The United Nation peacekeeping force in the Congo, MONUC, is the UN’s largest and most expensive intervention anywhere in the world.
Newspapers around the world dutifully wrote feel-good stories about how engaged environmentalists celebrated as the lights went out around the world.
When asked to extinguish electric lights, most people around the world would turn to candlelight instead.
Nor do we hear that the Antarctic is experiencing record sea ice coverage since satellite measurements began.
Like Father, Like Son
But Qaddafi’s regime became an international pariah mainly for a series of terrorist plots abroad, not for crimes against humanity committed against Libyans.
When I visited Tripoli in March 2010 for a “national reconciliation” conference, the conflicting statements given by Saif al-Islam and security officials surprised me.
Like Water for Climate
Likewise, the latest Hydration for Health science gathering, which promotes drinking more water, has been sponsored by Danone, which sells bottled water under brand names like Volvic and Evian.
Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation: prices have increased six-fold since 1969, so, while corn futures did set a record of about $8 per bushel in late July, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970’s, reaching a whopping $16 in 1974.
That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it.
Success will require that up to 80% of proven oil, gas, and coal reserves not be consumed.
Making matters worse, the details of these agreements are largely hidden, thereby preventing citizens from holding their governments accountable, which in turn undermines democracy and facilitates corruption.
And are citizens’ voices being heard?
This goal was achieved – but only by creating a huge 37-page document containing every possible option that countries may want to see in next year’s deal.
Likewise, the proposal by the European Union and the United States that countries’ plans be subject to some kind of assessment was dropped from the final text.
For this reason, the developed world has long wanted to replace the “firewall” between the two historic groupings with a form of differentiation that better reflects the contemporary world.
The Lima conference has shown just how hard the negotiations in Paris next year will be, despite recent optimism about global progress.
Faced with the urgent necessity of alleviating so many Americans’ suffering, Obama knows only too well that the “audacity of hope” will not be sufficient to the immensity of the challenges confronting him.
But this should not go too far, for there are limits to what the state can do, and the strength of private initiative constitutes one key aspect of America, which became the world’s leading nation thanks to its dynamism, flexibility, and individual inventiveness.
Yet the cards Obama is holding should not be underrated. Unlike Roosevelt, he has a perfect understanding of the nature of the economic challenges facing him, and, like Churchill, he benefits from the support of a population ready to follow him in a climate of national unity, at least in the short run.  
Similarly, from a global perspective, opening trade can contribute to the world’s overall economic growth, but does not guarantee that the benefits will be fairly distributed among countries.
For example, one of the critical issues blocking progress on the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Agenda of global free-trade talks centers on the extent to which major developing countries should open their markets.
Thus, aid for trade, one of the key tasks on the WTO agenda, has weak institutional links to trade negotiations.
But doing so requires innovative approaches that help to ensure that trade serves developing countries, rather than vice versa.
Likewise, in October 2014, US Treasury yields plummeted by almost 40 basis points in minutes, which statisticians argue should occur only once in three billion years.
Imagine a bank that invests in illiquid assets but allows depositors to redeem their cash overnight: if a run on these funds occurs, the need to sell the illiquid assets can push their price very low very fast, in what is effectively a fire sale.
But, over time, the longer central banks create liquidity to suppress short-run volatility, the more they will feed price bubbles in equity, bond, and other asset markets.
Service companies such as airlines could ask employees to collect feedback, but it was overly complicated.   
They can listen for many purposes – from figuring out what products or services to offer and understanding which customer wants what, to repairing the damage done when something goes wrong.
All of that is important, but then there’s the listening you do so that your customers can feel listened to.
But how can you make up for the headache they had all day from lack of sleep? You can’t – but showing that you noticed their unhappiness with you counts for a lot.
You don’t pick an arsonist to head the fire department, I thought when Obama named him co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.
In other words, the large surplus in the Social Security trust fund, which is made up of government bonds that general revenues are earmarked to pay for, does not really exist and cannot be drawn upon.
Perhaps the most bizarre of Simpson’s claims that are quoted by Berry is that the Social Security Commission of 1983 “never knew there was a baby boom....”


The loss of output in Italy since the beginning of the crisis is as great as it was in the 1930’s.
The problem is that the prescriptions being imposed are leading to massive underutilization of these resources.
There will also have to be Eurobonds, or an equivalent instrument.
But, rather than enhancing solidarity within Europe, it is sowing seeds of discord within and between countries.
But it is structural reform of the eurozone’s institutional arrangements, not reforms within individual countries, that will have the greatest impact.
The image of the warrior leader lingers in modern times.
They combine fear with corruption to maintain kleptocracies dominated by “the big man” and his coterie.
Various studies show that tall men are often favored, and that corporate CEOs are taller than average.
Surprisingly, however, when telephone interviews were included in the process, beautiful people did better, even though they were unseen by the employers.
Modern information societies require us to go beyond the “big man” approach to leadership.
Yet, the world faces many other vast challenges.
Yet the cost of the Kyoto Protocol would be a staggering $180 billion a year.
This would be easier, much less costly, and ultimately do far more good. Indeed, the Copenhagen Consensus experts discovered that for every dollar invested in Kyoto-style battling climate change, we could do up to 120 times more good with in numerous other areas.
The fundamental difficulty in planning for enhanced longevity is that we do not know whether it will really happen.
If there were no longevity risk – that is, if the probability of dying at each age in the future were reliably known – then pension funds could easily offer life annuities to large numbers of people by investing their assets in bonds of various maturities in order to pay out just the right amount each year.
Moreover, it is not clear that the EIB can get further help from reinsurers in managing the risks it assumes by issuing such bonds because reinsurers do not yet see how they can fully hedge the risks involved.
But longevity bonds, while only experimental today, will eventually become vitally important to the world economy.
The emergence of a non-polar world could prove to be mostly negative, making it more difficult to generate collective responses to pressing regional and global challenges.   More decision makers make it more difficult to make decisions.
Combating terrorism is also essential if the non-polar era is not to turn into a modern Dark Age.
Greater economic and military assistance to increase states’ ability to meet their responsibilities to their citizens and neighbors will also be essential.
This is less than optimal, but in a non-polar world, what is best may well prove the enemy of the possible.
But Keating’s remarks raise a general question about history that goes to the heart of the sense of identity that binds every community.
Sooner or later, the healthiest societies face up to what they have been – good and bad – and grow in decency and self-confidence as a result.
There are at least three lessons to draw from these musings of a one-time university history student.
Living on a Volcano
In rich countries, mass poverty, which seemed to have been eliminated around 1980, has reappeared.
In France, by contrast, 200,000 to 300,000 more people enter the labor market than leave it in each generation – and this does not include immigration, which, although slowing recently, represents a large number of job seekers.
But for the past three years, France has had a government that no longer believes that a socially oriented urban policy works.
Is not freedom enough? Why put security on the same level as that supreme value?
Nor is it only bombs that add to life's general uncertainties. Gradually, awareness is setting in that global warming is not just a gloom and doom fantasy.
So what should we do? Perhaps we should look at Popper again and remember his advice: to use what reason we have to tackle our insecurities.
A third need is to preserve, and in many cases to recreate, what one might call islands of security.
False gods have always profited from a widespread sense of insecurity.
This new critique of capitalism recently culminated in a series of attacks by the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Müntefering.
But Müntefering has a point.
Wages rose rapidly and most Germans experienced growing prosperity.
The share of net investment in GNP is now the second lowest in all OECD countries.
PARIS – As the deepest economic crisis of our lifetimes stretches into its seventh year, most OECD countries are continuing to underperform.
In short, as we argued during the OECD Forum and annual Ministerial Council Meeting last week, this time we need to promote investments that focus on people and the planet.
In order to encourage private investors to pursue long-term, responsible projects, governments need to promote consistent policies and frameworks.
Savings must be channeled to firms that need capital for innovation and sustainable job creation.
There is, of course, no Asian alternative to Russia’s cultural and political orientation towards Europe.
Russia must act now to secure a more dignified and beneficial place in a future world order.
Of course, such a strategy will require highways, bridges, railways, and seaports. (There are practically no grain-export terminals in Russia’s eastern regions, for example.)
But Europe's new eastern members can also act as a beacon for the Union, as Jacques Rupnik suggests.
Having spent a decade dismantling the debris of state socialism, most of these countries chafe at the idea of importing the European social market's idea of solidarity via the EU.
Second, public attitudes toward the social market system are remarkably similar in both Eastern and Western Europe.
Clearly, if the social market model is to expand eastward - thereby ensuring its viability within the whole Union - this is the only viable alternative.
So it must be doing something right.
An enlightened corporate state, where unions fully support growth and competitiveness objectives, can deliver the economic goods as well as more de-centralized systems.
Rather, she simply understands that for an economy that needs to stay competitive, bad-mouthing the euro and the ECB sends the wrong signals.
Sarkozy’s first foreign trip as France’s new president was to visit Chancellor Merkel.
Fortunately, at least half the voters in the region appreciate these improvements; otherwise, the situation would be far worse.
The state-owned oil company, which accounts for a major chunk of government revenue, is hugely inefficient, and invests far too little in new equipment and technology.
Does the pied piper of Venezuela offer a fairer and better way to grow?
Losing the Foreign Investment Race
To change the way Latin American countries sell themselves to foreign investors is a creative challenge. Selling goods for export and selling the country to foreign investors is very different.
An effective FDI promotion agency must be headed by an executive director with strong credentials and an excellent reputation in the private sector, supplemented by good international contacts and fluency in English.
But, since 2003, Turkey’s virtually unquestioned alliance with the United States has undergone a profound re-evaluation, due to the Iraq War, and the Turkish consensus on its decades-long EU candidacy has begun to wobble, owing to EU dithering.  Given Turkey’s central role not only in maintaining peace in the volatile Caucasus region but also in promoting peace in the Middle East – the talks now underway between Syria and Israel are, after all, being conducted with Turkish mediation – neglecting Turkey is not only foolish, it is dangerous.
In the early 1990’s, some Turkish generals saw the humiliation of Russian troops in Chechnya as part of a long-awaited revenge.
Even if the AKP can rely on the allegiance of millions of voters and swarms of new members anxious to join the winning side, the secularists are deeply entrenched in Turkey’s institutions, universities, media, and business.
But did it ever occur to anybody how hard Americans must work to make everyone else look good?
It isn’t. Going deep into debt when you have that much money to spend takes a lot of hard work.
Sure, the decision to invade Iraq was a big help in pushing the country’s finances off a cliff, but that is far from the whole story.
Foreigners are either going to start earning much better returns in the US, pushing American debt levels into unsustainable territory, or else they will pull back and invest elsewhere.
OK, so maybe it is too soon for the world to start toasting America’s insane consumption patterns.
Passivity is a low-cost approach – tracking a benchmark requires no work.
And some of these managers – like hedge funds – are not available to average investors.
Weeding out the bad and the ugly based on these scores, and thus picking more of the good apples, has been shown to provide higher returns with lower risk than actively managed alpha or passive beta funds.
Solar energy reaching the earth’s surface provides 5,000 times humanity’s energy needs.
And our cities will be cleaner, quieter, and more pleasant places to live as a result.
But no such thief exists, and we are cursed with fossil fuels in dangerous abundance.
The biggest threat to a prosperous low-carbon future is not a lack of technological options, but the waste that low fossil-fuel prices encourage.
Maybe this holiday season we should wish for a miracle.
From 2005 to 2015, the monetary base soared at an annual rate of 17.8%, whereas the CPI increased at an annual rate of just 1.9%.
The banks exchanged an interest-paying Treasury bill for a reserve deposit at the Fed that historically did not earn any interest.
Although a link between the Fed’s creation of reserves and the subsequent increase in spending remained, its magnitude changed dramatically. The Fed increased its securities holdings from less than $1 trillion in 2007 to more than $4 trillion today.
Labor markets have tightened significantly, with the overall unemployment rate down to 5.4%.
WASHINGTON, DC – The sharp drop in the price of crude oil since late June has been grabbing headlines worldwide – and producing a lot of contradictory explanations.
Of course, climate science is not precise; instead, it works in terms of probability ranges.
The structure of a carbon-pricing scheme remains up for discussion.
Today’s environment of falling oil prices enables the world to take that step.
And a sign of prosperity is supposed to be good health and longevity.
It is perhaps true that unhealthy habits are more concentrated among poor Americans, a disproportionate number of whom are black.
In 2005, President George W. Bush’s administration made it far more difficult for households to declare bankruptcy and write off debt.
Our data showed that GDP had fallen some 30% since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
As a result, the price formation process is much clumsier nowadays, with considerably longer adjustment lags.
Prices plummeted by more than half in a period of just a few months last year, catching many oil traders and analysts by surprise.
Over the next few months, the US will indeed alter its supply and demand conditions in a way that puts a floor under oil prices and enables a gradual recovery in the market.
AMSTERDAM – Western Europe’s small democracies have, on the whole, been exceptionally fortunate.
Although the Dutch government is still managed mostly by mainstream, steady-as-you-go Christian Democrats, right-wing populism is growing. Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party wants to ban the Koran, halt Muslim immigration, and deprive delinquents with an immigrant background of Dutch citizenship.
Much criticism and even abuse has been heaped on the Dutch for the way her adopted country has treated her.
It is easy to voice contempt of the Dutch government. But what has been lost in all the commentary is the nature of Hirsi Ali’s rise to prominence.
That, too, is the natural fate of being a lucky little country in Western Europe.
To be sure, Putin should be praised for substantial economic reforms during his first three years.
Moreover, Putin’s associates wanted Yukos’ wealth, which was confiscated by the state oil company Rosneft through lawless taxation, leaving Putin’s tax reform and judicial reform in tatters and severely undermining property rights.
The not very profitable state-owned Vneshtorgbank, for example, is on a buying spree, aggravating the quality of Russian banking.
Putin and his KGB friends from St. Petersburg sit safely on all this wealth, thanks to their authoritarian governance and control over all security organs.
How would the veil of ignorance work in a boardroom?
Not knowing whether they were male or female, they would ensure pay equity and better policies concerning parental leave and child care.
If directors remind themselves each time they enter the boardroom why they are there, and pause for a moment to consider how their views would be affected if they did not know who they were, they would make better decisions for the company and for the entire system in which it operates.
They are becoming more educated and aware of how companies operate, and they are more proactive and outspoken when they believe a company has crossed the line.
There was a massive conversation going on, and BP was neither a part of it nor able to control it via traditional communication-management methods.
With all of that comes a culture of questioning that which was previously unquestioned – including how companies are run and whether an organization’s actions are ethical.
Instead, they will make real changes – and they will be better off for it.
FIFA has two problems.
FIFA is as complex as any large multinational private or public organization; how it is governed must reflect that.
They are taking a much more active and public role in speaking out against bribery, corruption, and excessive pay packages, and in favor of corporate social responsibility and fair labor practices.
The caption to a picture of Blatter on page six of FIFA’s 2013 financial report reads: “We have reached very high levels of accountability, transparency, and financial control.”
The problem has two aspects.
But many branches of the service sector are a sink of dead-end, no-hope jobs.
But there is also a more troubling possibility: if, by proceeding on our current profligate path, we succeed in making natural resources scarce, we will require a new wave of technology, regardless of the cost, to rescue us from calamity.
Many other European countries are adopting the second solution.
After all, both capitalism and economics need scarcity to justify their existence, and will not give it up readily.
Machiavelli's message, however, was more complex.
“To those seeing and hearing him, the ruler should appear to be all mercy, all faithfulness, all integrity, all humanity, and all religion.
The notion that, at its core, Europe should be focused on something as mundane as tweaking fiscal rules seems disappointing, to say the least – especially as the continent confronts an intensifying humanitarian crisis, caused by the influx of refugees from war-ravaged countries like Libya and Syria.
Machiavelli's metaphor for the mystery of effective political conduct provides a potent template.
One of the most famous examples concerns the Great Depression – an epoch that policymakers frequently drew upon in trying to come to terms with the post-2007 financial crisis.
Would it not be desirable just to hide losses until uncertainty passed and confidence returned? In that case, new profits could quickly be used to plug the gaps, and no one would ever know about an apparently successful deception.
Indeed, misrepresentation by governments – driven by the belief that political ingenuity can stabilize expectations – is actually at the root of many financial crises.
To revert to the example of Depression-era Italy: the state holding-company edifice created to save the banks and maintain confidence proved to be an increasingly bureaucratic and costly burden on the Italian economy.
It is difficult to overstate the significance of the occasion. According to Héctor Schamis, a political scientist at Georgetown University, if a similar political change had occurred in France or Brazil, the country’s citizens would be celebrating the birth of a new republic.
And yet, the world should not expect free-market zealotry from Macri. He heads a broad coalition that includes his own liberal-minded Republican Proposal Party, the center-left Radical Civic Union, and other centrist groupings.
And the budget deficit has reached 7% of GDP. Some adjustment is inevitable.
Likewise, Macri’s victory could give voters in Venezuela – headed to the polls on December 6 – the courage they need to cast their ballots against their increasingly authoritarian government.
Property prices from London to San Francisco have risen to nosebleed-inducing levels.
And using interest rates to address such concerns may interfere with the central bank’s primary objective of keeping inflation near target.
Any attempt by the Fed to impose caps on loan-to-value ratios would also excite Americans’ fears of concentrated financial power – fears that have intensified since the crisis.
The Swedish Riksbank provides a cautionary case in point.
Gone, it seems, is the heyday of T-shirts, toys, plastic flowers, tiles, hooks, springs, and the like.
According to a study by the US consulting firm Jassin O’Rourke, labor costs in China are higher than in seven other Asian countries.
By January 2010, the value of exports has returned to its previous level in the same period of 2008.
For local planners, the export shock was a wake-up call for change.
Traditionally, contract manufacturers in China are scattered and fiercely competitive.
Compared to many developing countries, China’s government is stable and embraces foreign investment.
Her decision has raised the profile of Malawi, home to recurrent food shortages and seasonal famines.
Philere Nkhoma, an adviser to farmers in Malawi, asks. “Let’s have milk.
Nkhoma’s own story mirrors the shift in the status of farming in Africa.
Sachs has raised about $150 million for the villages, enough for five years of support.
Instead of more Madonnas, who in the glare of global publicity saves a lone child’s life, Africa needs more Nkhomas: passionate cheerleaders with deep local knowledge and a willingness to stand alongside peasants in the fields in order to grow food for all the other children.
There, until Madonna came into contact with him, he was living with about 500 other children.
Admittedly, David will be cut off from his cultural roots.
Despite the high rate of HIV/AIDS infections, Malawi’s population, like that of many developing nations, is growing rapidly.
Although good progress in meeting these goals has been made in Asia, in Africa there are now 140 million more people living in extreme poverty than there were in 1990.
Is it entirely relative, or are there objective grounds to characterize a behavior or act as evil? Do all confrontations occur between legitimate parties – with, say, one person’s terrorist being another’s freedom fighter – or can we say that some fights really are between good and evil?
We are programmed by our genes to feel concern for babies and empathy for people in pain.
The biologist Martin Nowak has argued that the only way humans have been able to sustain cooperation is by developing cheap ways to punish misbehavior.
In the US, there is a natural tendency to punish political candidates when they lie, but mostly about their personal peccadillos.
Magna Carta at 800
Copies were made and dispersed to many of the great English cathedrals.
The tradition of natural law offers an answer that was familiar to medieval scholars, for whom natural law was knowable to us by our natural reason (as opposed to those laws that could be discovered only through divine revelation).
Abbas introduced a totally different style of management from that of Arafat.
But, unlike Oslo, when Abbas was working under Arafat and able to project power from that base, as Palestinian president he was both negotiator and supposedly the center of power.
The nominal reason is Hamas’s refusal to recognize Israel.

इस पद्धति का दुनिया भर में पहले से ही अच्छा उपयोग किया जा रहा है। उदाहरण के लिए, “वन खातों” से यह पता चला है कि मध्य और दक्षिण अमेरिका में ग्वाटेमाला में वनों की कटाई की सबसे तेज़ दर है जहाँ परिवारों द्वारा अपनी खाना पकाने की जरूरतों को पूरा करने के लिए सबसे अधिक अनियंत्रित कटाई की जाती है। इस जानकारी ने ग्वाटेमाला सरकार को देश के वानिकी कानून की समीक्षा करने, और, जलाऊ लकड़ी के उपयोग को नियंत्रित करने, नई रणनीतियों के लिए निधियाँ मुहैया करने, वनों की अनधिकृत कटाई को रोकने, और परिवारों को वैकल्पिक ऊर्जा स्रोतों का उपयोग करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करने के लिए प्रेरित किया है।
ऐसा ही एक स्रोत है प्रवासियों द्वारा वित्तपोषण जिसका पर्याप्त दोहन नहीं हुआ है. प्रवासियों द्वारा वित्तपोषण का अर्थ है विदेशों में कार्यरत प्रवासियों द्वारा धन की बचत और इसे उनके मूल देश में परिवार व मित्रों को भेजा जाना. चुनौती है इस आय को किस तरह प्रभावी ढंग से प्रवाहित किया जाए.

प्रवासियों की बचत के बेहतर इस्तेमाल का एक और तरीका हो सकती है नई प्रवासी वित्तीय प्रणालियों की रचना. कम मूल्य की जमानत राशि (यथा 1000 डॉलर) जिस पर 3-4% ब्याज दर हो, आप्रवासी कर्मियों के लिए आकर्षक विकल्प साबित हो सकती है जिन्हें अभी अपने कार्य के देशों में जमाखातों पर न्यूनतम् ब्याज मिलता है. पांच साल के डायस्पोरा बॉन्ड प्रवासी को उस संप्रभु बॉन्ड से कम दर पर ब्याज मिलेगा जो विदेशी संस्थागत् निवेशकों को बेचा जाता है. इसका कारण है कि प्रवासी निवेशकों के उनके मूल देश में जोखिम को कम करके आंका जाता है. ये बॉन्ड विकासशील देशों में अप्रवासी विदेशी-मुद्रा जमाखातों की तुलना में कहीं अधिक स्थायी भी होंगे. और कार्य के बड़े देशों में उचित प्राधिकरणों के पास पंजीकृत कराने से ये बॉन्ड काफी सुरक्षित बन जाएंगे.
लेकिन विकासशील विश्व में विकास डेटा एक दुर्लभ संसाधन बना हुआ है। सामाजिक और आर्थिक प्रगति का आकलन करने - और उसे प्रोत्साहित करने - की दृष्टि से इनका जो महत्व है उसे देखते हुए इस कमी पर तुरंत ध्यान दिया जाना चाहिए। विकास डेटा तैयार करने और उसके उपयोग को बढ़ावा देने के लिए किसी उत्प्रेरक का होना आवश्यक है। इसे ध्यान में रखते हुए, 2015 के पश्चात के विकास कार्यक्रम के उच्च-स्तरीय पैनल ने वैश्विक “डेटा क्रांति” का जो आह्वान किया है वह उचित है।

Indeed, we are rethinking how we define success in development and how we provide trade-related support to developing countries.
Experience has demonstrated that, with forward-looking policies, governments can enhance trade’s benefits and mitigate its negative impact on the poor.
For example, we are helping to simplify and modernize trade procedures through Cameroon’s Douala port, and we have helped the government of Laos to establish an online portal that provides traders with access to all relevant laws, procedures, schedules, and forms from border-management agencies.
It viewed America’s backing for Hosni Mubarak’s fall from power in Egypt – and its subsequent acceptance of the Muslim Brotherhood government – as a betrayal.
And, at the beginning of 2014, Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal and Crown Prince Salman visited Islamabad to renew the two countries’ military agreements on joint arms production.
On the contrary, the Saudis have bankrolled the Pakistani state, and proved a generous host to its current prime minister, Mian Nawaz Sharif, during his long exile following the military coup that toppled his government in 1999.
In the event of an existential threat in the region, in particular a confrontation with Iran, Pakistan would offer the Kingdom a form of deadly protection denied it by the West.
LONDON – Ever since the Al Saud clan established in 1932 the kingdom to which they gave their name, the exercise of power in Saudi Arabia has been shaped by the intrigues and intricacies of royal politics.
To block a Sudeiri restoration, he initially grouped together a number of marginalized, likeminded princes.
Likewise, it is believed that Abdullah’s son, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Aziz, will soon replace Saud al Faisal, the world’s longest-serving foreign minister.
Saudi Arabia’s initial response to the fracturing of the regional order was to increase its support for those of its allies – Jordan, Lebanon, and Bahrain – that were still standing, and to turn the Egyptian army into its proxy, leading to the removal of the Muslim Brotherhood’s government.
In Iraq, America has unrivaled control of the air, but can’t hold the ground.
Through the 1990’s, US Vice President Dick Cheney and others made clear that Saddam’s reign threatened America’s oil security by forcing over-reliance on Saudi Arabia.
The US could bomb Vietnam’s cities to rubble, as it can Iraq’s cities, but this solves nothing, claims vast numbers of innocent lives, and confirms the view of Americans as occupiers. 
Bombing Libya did not bring Muammar Qadaffi “in from the cold.” Peaceful diplomacy did the job, showing Qadaffi that reopening diplomatic relations with the West and abandoning Libya’s nuclear ambitions would be advantageous for its own future and that of the country. 
America’s sway in Iraq will be limited, but leaving now would actually make it more effective than it is now, and at much less cost in terms of money and American, allied, and Iraqi lives.
Most people assume that this Commission exists to promote human rights and democratic freedoms.
So totalitarian or authoritarian states – more interested in hiding their own oppression than fairly judging other nations – can easily trigger a sort of political pogrom against any democracy that annoys enough tyrants.
So the goal of all free countries should be that only other free countries are allowed seats on the Commission for Human Rights.
Making a Market for Scientific Research
But if there is no market that impersonally values and rewards scientific achievement, how are good scientific projects to be selected and rewarded without the great waste that often accompanies non-market, bureaucratic solutions to the problems of provision of public goods?
In his 1945 book Science, the Endless Frontier , Bush argued that basic scientific research needs substantial and stable financial support; that support should be potentially available to all researchers; and that peer review should ultimately decide how and to whom funds are allocated.
Countries with politicized universities, or universities where bosses with powerful connections outside academia run the research enterprise, find it difficult to fund the best scientists.
But the benefits of markets can and should be pursued by other means.
Whether in sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East, their populations and governments are more inclined – for political, historical, or cultural reasons – to request European rather than NATO assistance.
Their essential tasks should be movement, information gathering, and, if necessary, combat.
The Capability Development Plan, which the EDA is developing in close collaboration with the EU Military Committee, aims to foster and improve solidarity in terms of capability, which is what Europe needs.
In September 2005, world leaders will meet at the UN to review the progress made since the Millennium Assembly in September 2000, when they pledged to support a set of ambitious objectives - the Millennium Development Goals ­- to help the world's poorest people escape poverty, hunger, disease, and illiteracy.
Communities living in mountainous areas, such as in the Andes, or Central Asia, or the highlands of East Africa, are especially isolated.
Instead, it gives around $15 billion.
Brown is exactly right: let's put Africa and other impoverished regions on a path of sustained economic growth by frontloading the aid during the period until 2015.
But I believe that globalization has enormous potential – as long as it is properly managed.
Growing inequality in the advanced industrial countries was a long-predicted but seldom advertised consequence of globalization.
The problem is that economic globalization has outpaced the globalization of politics and mindsets.
By contrast, taking control of the process holds out the possibility of remaking globalization, so that it at last lives up to its potential and its promise: higher living standards for everyone in the world.
Our world is not only unbalanced, but endangered.
Richer countries do much of the environmental damage.
Three areas can help speed progress:
Another two billion people will be added to global population over the next 25 years - the vast majority in poorer nations - with huge demands for energy and economic growth.
Policymakers seem to be of the same opinion, and not just in developing countries, judging by the EU’s launch of its 2020 flagship last year and the United States’ green energy policy.
Whereas the original concept of IP involved shielding industries from international competition, today’s world requires integrating local productive capacity in global value chains.
Governments should recognize mistakes and withdraw support before it becomes entrenched or too costly.
As more countries embrace IP, competition and conflict is bound to intensify.
There was a time when privatization – allowing individuals to set up individual savings accounts – seemed better than Social Security, which invests in lower-yielding Treasury bills.
Even if there is a problem, it can easily be fixed; spending a fraction of the money that went into Bush’s two tax cuts would have fixed Social Security for 75 years; slight benefit cuts, adjusting the age of retirement, or minor adjustments in the level of contributions could fix the system permanently.
Had Argentina not privatized, its budget would have been roughly in balance.
America’s Social Security program has been so successful in reducing poverty because the poor get back a little more than they contribute, and the rich get back a little less.
But the solution is not nearly as simple as some pundits make it out to be.
China’s tariffs declined precipitously in the late 1990’s, and many of the other inducements were also phased out.
This is a significant effect, even by the standards of China’s superlative growth performance.
It is not clear that advocates of this option have fully comprehended its potentially severe adverse consequences.
The first five months of this year were the warmest on record going back to 1880.
Today’s understanding of Earth’s climate and the human-induced component of climate change is the result of extremely difficult scientific work involving many thousands of scientists in all parts of the world.
Their general approach is to exaggerate the uncertainties of climate science and to leave the impression that climate scientists are engaged in some kind of conspiracy to frighten the public.
Instead of negotiating with vested interests in the backrooms of the White House and Congress, Obama should present a coherent plan to the American people.
The World Bank has long proclaimed its dream of “a world free from poverty.”
As for the World Bank, it does not need to “reposition” itself so much as to root itself in emerging countries, as does the development aid industry in general.
True, private capital flows have surged in the wake of global liberalization and these countries’ privatization schemes.
Its products need to be adapted.
Sri Lanka's bitter war of terror - one that practically invented the infamy of the suicide bomber - had been showing signs of abating of late. But a bitter power struggle between Sri Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and a schism among the rebel Tamil tigers, now threatens to reignite the violence.
Could the Malayan military strategy to contain the rebellion have been imported? British experts from the Malayan emergency tried to help the Americans in Vietnam - obviously without success.
Another factor arose from the fact that Tamils, on the whole, had been open to a succession of Portuguese, Dutch, and British administrations from the 16th century onwards, while most Sinhalese lived under their own king in the Kandyan kingdom until the 19th century.
In any case, they never claim to be indigenous to any particular locale, not even in Singapore, where ethnic Chinese make up three-quarters of the population.
And, to become prime minister, Anwar needs UMNO.
Traditionally, people voted for the DAP or the Justice Party to show their displeasure with the National Front.
Urban and middle-class voters such as those in Penang – a predominantly Chinese state with strong opposition sentiment – had always voted to keep the state legislature under the National Front in order to ensure continued funding, while sending opposition candidates to parliament to “pester” the National Front there.
Mali’s population is diverse: desert nomads, notably Tuaregs, in the north, and a majority of sedentary black populations in the south.
In January 2013, these groups formed a convoy of several hundred pick-ups and ATVs, armed with heavy machineguns.
In France, everyone understood and approved.
French troops are now set to return home.
Oil benefits a handful of princes.
TÜBINGEN, GERMANY ­– We are so surrounded by gadgetry nowadays that it is sometimes hard to tell where devices end and people begin.
This could be seen to challenge our notions of personhood and moral agency.
Moreover, humans often control dangerous and unpredictable tools, such as cars and guns.
Nevertheless, this does not raise a new ethical problem.
For example, Christopher Boorse, a philosopher at the University of Delaware, defines disease as a statistical deviation from “species-typical functioning.”
Until recently, Duch was the only one imprisoned, after being exposed in 1999.
My family escaped the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975, the day they claimed victory.
I couldn’t help but think: this was somebody’s daughter, somebody’s son. This was somebody’s mother or sister or brother.
When we start to see each other as less than human, we respond with inhuman acts.
This is, after all, the court’s first test of fairness before the trials of Duch and four of Pol Pot’s other henchmen begin next year.
Indeed, China’s investment rate may have surpassed 50% in 2009.
With an investment rate of 50% and a GDP growth rate of 8%, the incremental capital-output ratio could be higher than six, compared to 4.1 in 1991-2003, implying not only low efficiency, but also the possibility of a significant increase in nonperforming loans.
In 2010, for example, the government may seek to stimulate domestic consumption by making income distribution more favorable to the household sector relative to the enterprise sector, and by providing more public goods to reduce households’ precautionary savings.
But can the TTIP live up to the hype? Tellingly, the High-Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth, which was tasked with identifying the policies and measures that should define the negotiations, has recommended a more conservative approach.
The day after US President Barack Obama announced the launch of the TTIP negotiations, the European Commission released its blueprint for a Eurozone Financial Transaction Tax that would impose new costs on US banks operating in EU markets.
The EU overcame national biases to establish the Single Market by instituting a process of legally binding qualified majority voting, whereby individual member states could be outvoted on specific regulations.
At this rate, current oil output and oil exports now exceed post-invasion predictions.
They still have a long way to go, but significant improvements are already evident.
The new Iraqi government, even supported by US military might, will simply not be able to guarantee a predictable flow of oil, and output will remain quite volatile.
Even if President Bush wins reelection, it is highly unlikely that the US will make another outright grant to a sovereign Iraq.
Managing Risk to Save the Poor
So risk management, by smoothing out bumps in income, can be extremely important in alleviating the effects of poverty.
But crop insurance suffers from what economists call a “moral hazard,” because it reduces farmers’ incentives to ensure the crop’s success.
Today, weather insurance uses an expanded number of sophisticated weather stations and deep knowledge of the science of agriculture to measure weather’s effects on local agriculture.
WASHINGTON, DC – The developing world is experiencing rapid urbanization, with the number of city dwellers set to reach four billion in 2030 – double its 2000 level.
This entails, first and foremost, abandoning the perception of a tradeoff between “building more cities” to accommodate rapid urban growth and “building cities right” to enhance social and environmental outcomes.
For example, Seoul’s population more than tripled from 1960 to 2000.
This amounts to more than ten times the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s total expenditure in 2005, and six times the total value of municipal bonds issued by all local governments and utilities in India in more than a decade.
In April, Ann Wagner, a Republican congresswoman, introduced a bill “to prohibit the Securities and Exchange Commission from issuing rules requiring the disclosure of an issuer’s expenditures for political activities.”
Will parliamentarians become mere spokesmen of corporate interests? Is there any mechanism within the US Constitution, or other constitutions, to prevent this?
The current political game in the US is one in which both Republicans and Democrats compete for corporate money, which they then deploy in expensive campaigns to preserve or increase their power.
But its value is increasingly being questioned, especially in obesity research, where body-composition measurements are proving to be far more relevant.
Although recent studies suggest that high BMI scores do not necessarily increase risk of death, doctors find the BMI categories a useful basis for prevention and treatment.
Although many body components do scale to height by a power close to two, others do not.
But the differences between the metabolically healthy obese and the metabolically abnormal obese are inconsistent.
Of course, monetary expansion should be accompanied by a less contractionary fiscal stance in industrial countries. But the advanced economies’ room for fiscal maneuver is more limited than it was in 2007-2008, and America’s political gridlock has deepened, all but ruling out further stimulus through budgetary channels.
In short, the medium-term benefits that emerging economies could receive from faster growth in the US are now being swamped by short-term risks generated by the “capital tsunami,” as Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has called it.
The man, now sitting next to me, explains with a bit of understatement, “Of course I must continue to have faith in the Chinese legal system, although I must admit that this incident has somewhat dampened my optimism.”
Formal complaints to the justice ministry and the national bar association weren’t even acknowledged, let alone answered.
With little oversight from the central government, and no independent judiciary or a free press to hold them accountable, local authorities in rural areas are often a law unto themselves.
Administrative restrictions on lawyers were tightened to discourage class action or multiple plaintiff suits – typically cases against arbitrary or corrupt government actions – and to facilitate local authorities’ intervention and control over cases.
This is one reason why China has a Taiwan “problem.”
To help finance his communist movement in the 1930’s, Mao squeezed poor peasant families with any assets in the “Red” zone he controlled.
Indeed, in 1950 and 1951 an estimated three million people perished by execution, torture, or suicide.
As a result, his Red Guards destroyed ancient books, priceless antiques, monuments across the land, and nearly all Buddhist monasteries in Tibet.
China’s people have long been ready for this.
This is especially true of our flawed heroes, as we see today with the Chinese Communist Party’s treatment of Mao Zedong.
Mao’s establishment of authority over China, his injection of patriotic pride into a land that had been appallingly sundered and humiliated by external and internal forces for a century and a half, and his romantic legend as a global revolutionary leader – all contribute to the moral and political legitimacy for which China’s leaders search.
I remember being told a story about China that gives credence to the Communist leadership’s generous verdict on Mao.
She witnessed the return of the greed and corruption that she believed had destroyed the Kuomintang in the 1930’s and 1940’s.
Mao made China proud. Deng made it prosperous.
Political failure killed Ché, and illness took Evita's life, possibly saving her from the kind of political calamity that befell her husband a few years later.
His was a theatrical performance staged in a marvelous setting; and his victories were triumphs of beauty and intelligence.
Each time, he moves a little closer toward death.
We have not yet properly mourned, nor reflected upon, our nation's systematic fall into poverty; nor the disappearance of former President Carlos Saúl Menem's mirage of a First World Argentina; nor our institutions' loss of legitimacy; nor our corruption and our violence.
"Show us a good time, bring our hearts some fun."
Among the worst affected was Argentina; the Russian crisis exacerbated a decline in investors’ confidence in emerging markets that culminated in Argentina’s sovereign default less than four years later. Even the US and Europe were not immune, with the collapse of the major hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) fueling anxiety about the viability of many other financial institutions.
Having just emerged from a deep recession, financial disruptions could easily cause Europe to slide back into recession, particularly given the eurozone economy’s close links to Russia via trade and energy.
In any case, US and European leaders must recognize that all sanctions will have costs – many of them unexpected – for both sides. If they are not willing to risk global financial stability in an unpredictable game of chicken with Putin, perhaps it would be wise to re-think the composition of the sanctions that they impose.
Uruguayans still derive immeasurable satisfaction from their soccer successes, including two World Cup triumphs (albeit back in 1930 and 1950) and a semifinal in South Africa in 2010.
To separate political activism from love of the game is a false distinction.
Although football victories have sometimes united bitter opponents, such truces have been all too ephemeral, and usually end soon after the final whistle blows.
At stake is not just an economic calculation, but also a judgment about the outlook of the single currency itself.
For this reason, Poland is sometimes called the “China of Europe.”
One in four employees is on a fixed-term contract or self-employed.
Such a policy was successfully implemented in 2009 and 2010, but the government lacked the funds it needed when economic conditions subsequently deteriorated.
Consider each of those growth factors.
The third engine of growth, total factor productivity, will also be unable to maintain the relentless gains witnessed from the late 1990’s to the mid-2000’s.
Thus, with supply-side factors no longer driving global growth, we must reassess our expectations of what monetary and fiscal policies can achieve.
For many of us who grew up in the Soviet Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe, Margaret Thatcher will always be a heroine.
Thatcher’s embrace of the cause of our freedom was electrifying for me.
That common-sense fusion of family values and fiscal probity set an example for every elected leader who has followed her.
In the 1980’s, the near-simultaneous crisis of communism in the East and social democracy in the West gave her the opportunity to do great deeds.
Thatcher was brave and resolute, but she was not magnanimous. She won famous victories, but showed no generosity to the defeated, in word or deed.
In her famous Bruges speech in 1988, she thundered: “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.”
The aim of all three measures was to restore both state authority and economic dynamism.
She owed her power to a divided opposition and a first-past-the-post electoral system.
Marginalizing Malaria
Yet, while total eradication is beyond the horizon, and new tools are needed to get there, there is much that can be achieved in the near term with our current armory.
This strategy has begun to emerge organically, without prompting from the global community.
LONDON – The new fault line in politics, according to Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Front, is between globalists and patriots.
That’s why it must be rebutted, both in France and elsewhere.
The second part of this argument – that the interests of ordinary people have been subordinated to those of the elite – must be heard and responded to. A democracy in which a majority feels neglected or exploited is not sustainable.
Mainstream parties must reclaim the mantle of patriotism and redefine the national interest accordingly.
It is likely that Draghi’s statement will indeed be followed by ECB purchases of Spanish (and Italian) sovereign bonds.
The eurozone can no longer sustain continued uncertainty and high real interest rates in the peripheral countries, so the ECB must provide a solid and credible bridge to the future.
Brilliant Blunders
For a theory to be considered scientific, it must yield specific predictions of future observations or experimental results.
Though Kelvin’s estimate was seriously flawed, the effort remains central to the history of knowledge, because it applied real science – the laws of physics – to what had long been a subject of vague speculation.
Until about a decade ago, the Space Telescope Science Institute adopted a similar policy for allocating observation time for the Hubble Space Telescope.
I always find the question somewhat irritating, perhaps revealing the persistence of an arrogant imperial mindset.
The pound initially fell sharply, and then recovered, while long-term government borrowing rates have risen by around 30 basis points.
That leads to the second problem: the so-called knockouts – the other factors that can change the direction of policy – are clearly matters of judgment, not of fact.
Some argue that it would have been simpler to merge the two, and the unwieldiness of the new means of articulating policy suggests that this might indeed have been a good idea.
But one would surely not start from there if that were the long-term policy aim.
But the sum is larger than $250,000 – the maximum that the government insures in a single account.
But the money market’s size is not the only reason for its fragility. Another problem is that banks are not the only institutions managing it.
The third is to allow this kind of lending only against rock-solid collateral, such as Treasury bonds – not mortgage-backed securities, which can lose value quickly during a crisis, requiring a government bailout.
Singlehandedly, Snowden has changed how people regard their phones, tablets, and laptops, and sparked a public debate about the protection of personal data. What his revelations have not done is bring about significant reforms.
And not only does Canadian law prohibit companies from reporting virtually any information about government requests for data; Prime Minister Stephen Harper has nominated a lawyer who spent his career advising intelligence agencies to serve as an official privacy commissioner, raising the ire of activists.
A year ago, Snowden alerted the world to governments’ egregious violation of people’s privacy.
In those days, if you wanted to know something but did not own an expensive encyclopedia (or your encyclopedia was no longer sufficiently up-to-date to tell you what you wanted to know), you had to go to a library and spend hours searching for what you needed.
For example, if farmers could use it to get more accurate predictions of favorable conditions for planting, or to obtain higher prices for their harvest, they would be better able to afford sanitation, so that their children do not get diarrhea, and bed nets to protect themselves and their families against malaria.
Providing universal Internet access is a project on a scale similar to sequencing the human genome, and, like the human-genome project, it will raise new risks and sensitive ethical issues.
Strident articles critical of the United States, Japan, and Taiwan appear with increasing frequency and receive ever more prominent placement.
As Deng Xiaoping’s reforms evolved, and especially after Deng’s “tour of the South” in 1992, when he signaled permission for high-speed marketization of the economy, China’s media changed beyond recognition.
Even as China’s position in the world continues to rise and its people become more self-confident, China’s history of weakness before the Western powers and Japan sustains a “victim culture” that leaves most Chinese sensitive to any foreign challenge.
The media may make money, but as the recent anti-Japan protests suggests, an excess of such market-driven jingoism can damage a nation’s interests and international standing.
Once those limits were removed, Erdoğan’s governments embraced economic populism and authoritarian politics. Investors’ apparent optimism following the AKP’s victory recalls Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.
But today it is the police officers who led the corruption probe against Erdoğan who are in jail. Some of the media outlets that supported the probe have been closed down and taken over by the government.
We should not be surprised that the same characteristics can distort markets’ judgment of countries’ governance and political prospects.
The theory underlying the law is that a new set of accredited third-party marketplaces, rather than the overburdened Securities and Exchange Commission (which missed Bernie Madoff’s monster Ponzi scheme), will ensure that entrepreneurs tell the truth, and that investors know what they are buying.
The banks that originated mortgage loans sold their portfolios to investors who didn't really understand what they were buying.&nbsp;
Indeed, many people whom an entrepreneur might have hired will probably become CEOs of competing start-ups.
As on the Internet, so in real life: sometimes friction has a purpose.
These were significant declines – larger one-day drops in the Dow, for example, have occurred only 35 times since January 1950, or about once every twenty months.

At the time of the September 11-12, 1986, event, I thought very hard about what could have caused it.
But then a 2% fall in the Dow on March 13 pushed the VIX back up.
The fundamental features of the post-Cold War geopolitical context are relatively clear.
Even when Americans and Europeans agree in principle, such as on trade, this does not always translate into practice.
Europe must develop greater military capabilities, not to become a major power on par with the US, but so that it can act as America’s partner if it so chooses and to pursue its own goals. A division of labor whereby the US employs military force and Europe uses other policy instruments will gradually divide the US from Europe.
The best guideline is to not permit disagreements to spill over and complicate or infect the relationship.
But transatlantic relations – no less than relations among the 25 members of the EU or the 26 members of NATO – cannot be an all-or-nothing proposition, lest they run the risk of becoming nothing.
A further problem is that these exercises rarely address the implications of national policies for third countries and the international system.
It would probably be too politically sensitive for the Fund to announce by exactly how much different currencies were overvalued and undervalued, and to declare some as seriously misaligned.
Others hesitate, either because they worry about not qualifying or because they remain concerned about the stigma of association with the Fund.
Saving Retirement
Although this would reduce the annual rate of increase in benefits by only about 0.25%, outlays for Social Security and other inflation-indexed programs over the next ten years would be more than $200 billion lower.
Individuals who want to retire as early as 62 can still do so with an actuarially fair reduction in their benefits.
The obvious solution to the current and future Social Security financing problem is to reprise the 1983 legislation by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 67 to 70, with appropriate actuarial adjustments for earlier and later retirements.
CAMBRIDGE – China’s economic policymakers want to shift the country’s production away from exports and heavy industry, and to increase the share of consumption in GDP.
People save so much because insurance is so inadequate.
The Chinese government recently modified the tax law to exclude employers’ contributions to employee pension plans from taxable income and to allow the funds in those plans to accumulate tax-free.
In short, favorable tax treatment of the purchase of insurance for major medical costs would reduce the national saving rate, increase consumer spending, lower the public’s anxiety about the cost of treatment, and increase the quantity of health care.
By contrast, the Maastricht Treaty tasked the ECB with maintaining “price stability,” but left it free to provide its own operational definition.
For the past 12 months, that rate of increase has been about 1.5%.
The Fed could argue that the gap between current and full-employment GDP is larger than the 6.1% unemployment rate implies, owing to the large number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time employment and the sharp decline in the labor force participation rate.
He or she might veto it, but a Republican president after the 2016 election might not.
Any reader who went beyond the headlines soon discovered that the prediction of a zero budget deficit was in fact misleading.
In this case, the overall Greek deficit would be about 15% of GDP, putting its debt on a rapidly exploding path.
Budget deficits and the resulting national debt are important not only in themselves; they also contribute to a country’s current-account deficit, which is the difference between its level of domestic investment by businesses and households in structures and equipment and the amount that it saves to finance those investments.
The program was therefore formally launched on October 1.
Individuals who do not receive insurance from their employers are required to purchase insurance on their own, with low-income buyers receiving a government subsidy.
The preferred alternative for these individuals is to wait to buy insurance until they are ill and are facing large medical bills.
Given the very limited scope and unpredictable nature of the conditions that it would cover, the premium for such a policy would be very low.
CAMBRIDGE – An increasing number of American companies are making plans to shift their headquarters to Europe.
But if it reinvests the profits in Ireland – or in any other country – no further tax must be paid.
A few years ago, the US Treasury Department estimated that shifting to a territorial system would reduce corporate tax revenue by only $130 billion over ten years.
It could repatriate $500 million at any time with no additional tax liability.
But let’s look beyond 2014 and ask what will happen to US economic growth over the longer term.
But things are even better than those numbers imply.
We know what these cost and how much they add to the total nominal value of GDP.
Sonia Gandhi, the head of Congress and the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has been the power behind the throne since 1998, turning Prime Minister Manmohan Singh into little more than a figurehead. Under her leadership, Congress has pursued a populist agenda that increased transfer payments and reduced India’s annual economic-growth rate to less than 4% in 2013.
Only 60% of the adult population can read and write at an elementary level.
In the current system, the government buys, warehouses, and distributes agricultural products. As a result, an enormous amount of goods are spoiled in storage, while production incentives are misdirected.
The government should crack down on instances of high-level graft and use the new system of cash transfers to limit the scope of petty corruption.
I also stressed that financial markets had become dysfunctional.
US President Barack Obama’s new administration announced a three-year fiscal package intended to stimulate aggregate demand.
Despite the fall in long-term interest rates, house prices reached bottom only in 2012, and the stock market did not rise faster than corporate earnings until 2013.
And debt and equity markets may not continue to respond benignly to the Fed’s wind-down of quantitative easing.
Even by the end of 2016, the midpoint of the range is less than 3%.
So if price stability were the Fed’s only goal, the federal funds rate should now be close to 4%.
With short-term unemployment currently at 4.2%, the inflation rate is indeed rising, and Krueger’s research suggests that it will increase further in the months ahead.
As former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke explained when he launched large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing, that increase in wealth – and the resulting rise in consumer spending – was the intended result.
Another indication of the role of wealth in fueling higher consumer spending is the decline in the household saving rate.
Though the prospect of a rising deficit and national debt in the longer term remains, the two-year budget agreement enacted by the US Congress means that the economy will not be subject to such negative fiscal shocks in 2014 or 2015.
The situation now has diverged from the traditional scenario in which the Fed controlled the banks’ use of reserves by adjusting the federal funds rate (the rate at which banks lend their reserves to one another).
But the region has struggled to regain momentum since the global financial crisis and subsequent recession.
And, despite substantial improvement in the business environment throughout the region, these economies rank behind their EU-15 neighbors on corruption (though they are doing better than other emerging economies, including China, India, Brazil, and Russia).
Led by Poland, the region is an increasingly important location for outsourcing and offshoring work.
Opening them more fully to competition and market incentives would help to raise productivity in these industries.

कुछ देश पहले ही इस तरह के दृष्टिकोण का लाभ उठा रहे हैं। दक्षिण कोरिया के सार्वजनिक और निजी बुनियादी सुविधा निवेश प्रबंधन केंद्र ने बुनियादी सुविधाओं के ख़र्च को 35% तक कम कर दिया है; आज, अधिकारी समीक्षा किए जाने वाली प्रस्तावित परियोजनाओं में से 46% को अस्वीकार कर देते हैं, इसकी तुलना में पहले यह 3% ही था।
यह लक्ष्य अमीर और ग़रीब दोनों प्रकार के देशों में समान रूप से हासिल किया जा सकता है। उदाहरण के लिए, स्विट्ज़रलैंड का पर्यावरण, परिवहन, ऊर्जा, और संचार विभाग संघीय परिषद द्वारा निर्धारित राष्ट्रीय लक्ष्यों को ऐसी एकीकृत बुनियादी रणनीति में शामिल करता है, जिसमें विशिष्ट क्षेत्रों की ज़रूरतों को ध्यान में रखा जाता है। इसी तरह, रवांडा का बुनियादी सुविधा मंत्रालय अन्य मंत्रालयों और सरकारी एजेंसियों की गतिविधियों का समन्वयन करता है और स्रोतेतर वितरण और संचालनों की निगरानी करता है - और सुनिश्चित करता है कि बुनियादी सुविधा रणनीतियाँ पूर्वी अफ़्रीकी समुदाय की क्षेत्रीय एकीकरण की योजनाओं के अनुरूप हों।
International aid is now flowing toward the army, with Saudi Arabia alone pledging more than $3 billion.
Moreover, the army received an outpouring of public support, which is understandable, given the lack of any other unifying institution.
But this inspiring model is under threat, as Lebanon struggles to cope with massive debt and the spread of abject poverty in rural areas, especially among Sunnis.
अम्मान - जब 2011 में अरब जागरण शुरू हुआ, तो इसका प्रमुख लक्ष्य बहुलवाद और लोकतंत्र को आगे बढ़ाना होना चाहिए था - वे कारण जिनकी बीसवीं सदी में अरब दुनिया के पहले, औपनिवेशिक-विरोधी जागरण में उपेक्षा की गई थी। लेकिन, संघर्ष के तीन साल बाद, यह प्रक्रिया केवल अभी शुरू ही हुई है। क्या दूसरा अरब जागरण अंततः अपने लक्ष्य प्राप्त कर सकेगा?

Europe’s Educational Evolution
This means developing differentiated education systems, ranging from vocational schools to doctoral programs, and giving students access to international experience, which can expose them to opportunities beyond national frontiers.
While these new modes of delivery are undoubtedly transforming education, especially higher education, what is happening may be more evolution than revolution.
That is the real challenge facing Europe.
Even if China deliberately acted falsely – endorsing sanctions, while knowing that it would not enforce them – it would have used its support for Chang to tame Kim. Chang’s execution was thus a straightforward challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping – a move that, under normal circumstances, would prompt China to suspend, or at least reduce, its support for North Korea.
The lack of a countervailing ground force in northern China makes it vulnerable to a possible coup by Shenyang, which has already taken advantage of its influence on the North Korean regime to put pressure on China’s leaders.
Under the treaty, Japan renounced its sovereignty claims over the Spratly and the Paracel Islands, but did not reassign them to any single country.
When Japan shifted its diplomatic recognition from the ROC to the PRC, it recognized the latter as the “sole legal government of China.” Given that Japan was not recognizing China as a new state – international recognition of the Chinese state had existed without interruption since the ROC government emerged in 1912 – the PRC effectively accepted the rights and obligations of the previous government.
The US and other extra-regional powers should take advantage of this fact, invoking their latent collective custody of the Spratly and the Paracel Islands in accordance with the San Francisco Treaty, and internationalize separate bilateral diplomatic processes between China and regional claimants.
The species that are so rapidly disappearing provide human beings with indispensable ecosystem services: regulating the climate, maintaining soil fertility, pollinating crops and defending them from pests, filtering fresh water, and supplying food.
It means more pesticides, detergents, antibiotics, glues, lubricants, preservatives, and plastics, many of which contain compounds that mimic mammalian hormones.
To see this phenomenon at work, consider the oil industry.
Our population bomb has already claimed its first casualties.
Sealing itself off from the bracing effects of global competition is sapping Brazil of much-needed momentum, with serious consequences for households, most of which have experienced only modest income growth in recent years.
For decades, Brazil’s economic policy has drawn on the strength of its huge domestic market and protected local industries through a complex system of subsidies, taxes, and tariffs.
One critical difference was the authorities’ emphasis on boosting R&D in these sectors before reducing the government’s direct role.
With improved digital links, Brazil would gain new opportunities to improve productivity and innovation.
We must have the insight to recognize this, and the audacity to say so.
After all, psychology, economics, and evolutionary biology have often claimed that humans share an essentially selfish nature.
But reversing that growth would create other problems; forcing people to compete for diminishing assets and resources would spread unemployment, poverty, and even violence.
MOSCOW – Watching Russia’s worrying trajectory under President Vladimir Putin, many foreign observers ask how a leader who is so apparently driving his country toward the abyss can remain so popular.
The Russian political field has been carefully cleared of all competition.
With the economy showing no sign of recovering the robust growth rates that had bolstered Putin’s popularity in the past, regaining support would have required undertaking the daunting task of fulfilling citizens’ demands for better education, improved health-care services, and more affordable housing.
According to the professional services firm Deloitte, mortgage debt in Russia is 20 times lower, on average, than in the European Union.
May Day Madness
The directive contains safeguards to limit potential abuse of welfare-state benefits during the first five years, including proof of health insurance coverage and a requirement that sufficient “resources” be shown when a residence permit of up to five years is requested.
When the five years of legal residence are completed, an immigrant automatically gains the inalienable right to permanent residence.
The directive on free movement implies a new era of direct migration into West European welfare states.
But that would mean a substantial change in the direction of EU social policies, including revision of the draft constitution.
Each would introduce aggressive targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
The Warner-Lieberman bill on climate change – a piece of legislation which was recently abandoned in the US Senate but is seen as a precursor of future policy – would have postponed the temperature increase in 2050 by about two years.
So we need to reduce by roughly ten-fold the cost of cutting emissions. We can achieve this by spending dramatically more researching and developing low-carbon energy.
He and his followers knew that as long as they remained in Mecca, they would be despised by non-Muslims; their very lives were in danger.
Following these expulsions – most notably by the Spanish and Russian Empires – the concept came to signify not only the pressure to migrate, as during Mohammed’s lifetime, but also an ultimatum from the state: leave or you will be slaughtered.
For the Islamic State’s crude and contrived medievalism, the past is of only instrumental value, to be refashioned in the service of violent conquest and savage repression.
Since 2000, measles cases in the US have been attributed largely to travelers bringing the disease into the country.
Of course, vaccinations can have some side effects, such as a rash, fatigue, headache, or a fever.
Parents argue that vaccination, like all other decisions about how to raise and care for their children, should be their choice.
Paul – who is, ironically, a physician – went so far as to mention the many children he knew who suffered “profound mental disorders” after having had vaccinations, indulging the anti-vaccination advocates who might support him politically, while stopping short of making a false scientific claim. (By his logic, vaccines make people taller, too; after all, nearly every child I have known has grown taller after being vaccinated.)
Is this just because we have been maneuvered into fearing someone worse, a sabre-rattling silovik (past or present member of the security services), like former Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov? Or does Medvedev represent a genuine opportunity to unfreeze the current mini-Cold War between Russia and the West?
Political technology means secretly sponsoring fake politicians like Bogdanov, setting up fake NGO’s and “patriotic” youth movements like Nashi (Ours) to prevent a Russian version of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, and mobilizing voters against a carefully scripted “enemy.”
There are rumors that Sechin’s clan has designs on Russia’s Stabilization Fund, which soaring energy prices have pumped up to over $140 billion.
Europe should avoid repeating the over-reaction of many leaders when Putin succeeded the ailing Yeltsin in 2000.
However, in my family’s next generation, all of my nieces and nephews have a high-school diploma and most have attended university.
Since 2003, this extra money has allowed the government to hire some 410,000 more teachers, add 205,000 classrooms, and distribute 1.8 billion free textbooks.
And in 2012, Turkey raised the minimum period of compulsory education to 12 years.
But the OECD’s 2012 report found that only 15% of lower test scores among Turkish students could be explained by their socioeconomic standing, a better outcome than the OECD average.

गेट्स फ़ाउंडेशन में मैं अपना काफी समय उन बहुत-से तरीकों को समझने में लगाती हूँ जिनसे महिलाएँ और बालिकाएँ विकास कार्य को आगे बढ़ात�� हैं: अपने बच्चों के पोषण, बुनियादी स्वास्थ्य और शिक्षा में निवेश करके - तथा कृषि श्रम उपलब्ध करके भी। अब मैं जो समझ पा रही हूँ वह यह है कि अगर अफ़्रीका किसी कृषि क्रांति की उम्मीद करता है तो इसके देशों को पहले एक मुख्य रुकावट, अर्थात व्यापक लैंगिक अंतर को दूर करना होगा जिसके कारण यह क्षेत्र पिछड़ा हुआ है।

·        Regulators proved unable to forecast and prevent the crisis.
Both nuclear and financial “meltdowns” tend to leave behind “fallout.”
Both Lehman Brothers and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) were able to increase their profits as long as the risk they were willing to accept did not materialize.
So what should be done?
This likely outcome mirrors the initiative for a European or global banking fund to insure against the next financial crisis.
Last month, an unprecedented new low was reached after decades of decline.
In July, 97% of the sheet’s surface was affected.
Less ice reflects less sunlight, and more open ocean absorbs more heat, which is then released into the atmosphere, affecting wind and pressure patterns throughout the northern hemisphere.
Worried about an invasion of migrant workers from the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe, the old EU members have erected high barriers in order to prevent the flow.
Aging populations and lower fertility rates in the new member states might result in even smaller flows.
Nothing comes easy in this world: if the Union cannot manage a multicultural society in Europe, then it ought to prepare itself for permanent stagnation.
As parliamentary and presidential elections loom, everyone wants to figure out just what he is up to.
In the 2000 general election, as the ruling center-right coalition imploded, the PRM received about 20% of the popular vote, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.
For the occasion, Tudor wore a yarmulke and spoke about his "philo-Semitism" for more than two hours . Other PRM representatives, provided with yarmulkes by Tudor, shuffled their feet awkwardly.
After all, they governed together with the PRM from1992 to 1996.
Facing Down Mental Illness
We should no more blame a person for a malfunctioning brain than for a malfunctioning pancreas, liver, or heart.
After a heart attack, for example, the prognosis depends on the presence or absence of depression more than on virtually any measure of cardiac function.
Even in the developed world, it is estimated that only about half of all people suffering from depression are diagnosed and treated.
We need research to develop better treatments for brain disorders in general, and for mental illnesses in particular.
What should the minister do?
In this model, the economy needs a state that eagerly lends an ear to business, and, when necessary, greases the wheels of commerce by providing incentives, subsidies, and other discretionary benefits.
China’s pursuit of a high-saving, large-trade-surplus economy in recent years embodies mercantilist teachings.
As a result, China will have to make important changes to its economic strategy, a necessity for which it has yet to prepare itself.
LONDON – Two hundred years have passed since the battle of Waterloo, where Napoleon’s calamitous defeat made such a huge dent in his country’s self-image that General Charles de Gaulle, in his history of the French army, simply omitted it.
So the key is that the leader has the opportunity to consider alternatives, and choose the right one for his or her country.
But one does not need to be universally liked – or even likable – to be a great leader.
I mean no insult to the House of Luxembourg when I say that it is unlikely that a great leader will emerge from that tiny country, especially given its generally uncontentious politics.
And what of today? The only contemporary European who can lay claim to the mantle of greatness is German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the European Union’s de facto leader.
The latest attempt to halt the war in eastern Ukraine by diplomatic means had an even shorter shelf life than the first attempt last September. The new accord – concluded, like the previous one, in Minsk – de facto recognized that Ukraine has been split by military means.
The sun was shining on Germany and its economy, and Merkel regarded it as her highest duty to maintain citizens' sense of wellbeing by not disturbing them with politics.
And it will be nearly impossible to convince European taxpayers and governments to provide further billions of euros without verifiable guarantees and the necessary reforms.
Germany will have to loosen its beloved purse strings, and France will have to surrender some of its precious political sovereignty.
If she succeeds, she will emerge as the first great European leader of the twenty-first century.
Germany needs both China’s markets and the funds that its government can deploy to purchase German and European bonds.
Hans Kundnani and Jonas Parello-Plesner of the European Council on Foreign Relations view the China-Germany relationship as one that will shape the overall China-EU relationship.
In German political circles in 1990, the very idea would have seemed monstrous and absurd.
Integration with the West took precedence over German unity.
Germany thus had to find a way forward that satisfied both the pacifism of a large majority of the German public and the military requirements of NATO.
It is no coincidence that one of Putin’s central aims is to disengage Germany from the West (or at least to neutralize it).
But it would be naive to think that Russia will give up so easily.
And some are eager to do so.
Likewise, in April, Putin signed legislation simplifying the procedure for Russian speakers in former Soviet republics to obtain Russian citizenship.
MEXICO CITY – Mexico is poised to become Latin America’s economic star in the coming decade.
Until the reform, energy reserves had long been regarded as a national patrimony that could be developed only by Pemex.
The price of gas in the US and Canada is only about half the current price in Mexico (and less than half the price in Europe and Asia).
But, despite such problems, the energy and electricity reforms, and the deeper links with the US and Canada that they imply, promises to accelerate Mexico’s growth rate, boost employment and income, and thus raise Mexicans’ standard of living.
Dollar wages, moreover, have grown much more slowly than in China; As a result, labor is now some 20% cheaper in Mexico in relative terms.
Large firms, oriented toward the global economy, have done quite well, whereas traditional, informal firms – exemplified by the ubiquitous neighborhood tortillerías – have performed poorly while continuing to absorb the bulk of the economy’s work force.
First, external trade and foreign investment on their own cannot lift an economy in the absence of the simultaneous development of productive capabilities at home.
Such collaboration is especially important for the medium-size firms at the cusp of breaking into the big leagues.
He was elected with just 38% of the vote, without a majority in either house of Congress, and with the opposition in control of Mexico City, the capital.
Two years on, success seems to be slipping through Peña Nieto’s hands.
Protests erupted across Mexico.
The trouble with this strategy is what no Mexican president has been willing to acknowledge: the country has never experienced the rule of law.
Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a few hundred miles from the border, the series chronicles the rise and fall of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a methamphetamine tycoon.
The agenda includes an expansion of the tax base to reduce dependency on oil, an initiative to increase competition in media and telecommunications, and a constitutional change that will permit the state-owned oil company Pemex to enter into joint ventures with foreign firms.
Or the US could slip into recession (though modest growth is certainly the central scenario nowadays).
Second, the US, with its incredibly lax restrictions on gun purchases, serves as a veritable arms depot for rich Mexican drug lords.
While tax reform was high on President Felipe Calderón’s agenda during last year’s presidential campaign, electoral reform was not. Instead, it has been imposed upon him by a strange and extreme version of political horse-trading.
Against this backdrop, the ejection of the IFE directors stands out all the more glaringly.
It shouldn’t, and if anyone should know that, it is Calderón.
I pointed out that neither the US nor Mexico was to blame; only Calderón was.
One was deployment of overwhelming force, which the Mexican military lacks.
Cannabis production grew by 300 metric tons over this period, to 15,800 metric tons.
America’s economic success and the collapse of communism fed the narrative.
China is an obvious example of capitalist success and lagging political reform.
So it is not surprising that massive government deficits financed by explosive monetary growth have caused the currency to collapse, with multinationals writing down the value of their Venezuelan subsidiaries each time the official exchange rate is lowered.
A decade ago, it was Domingo Cavallo, who, as Argentina’s finance minister, had pegged the peso to the dollar to bring down the 1,000% inflation that was destroying the economy – and the fabric of society.
Even attempted suppression of free and open debate, or official delegitimization of those with alternative policy proposals, is dangerous.
For example, the notion of modeling children as a durable good seemed crass to some but led Becker to analyze the allocation of parental time and financial resources.
He often looked at broad, long-range trends and data, comparing things like family structure, number of children, and women’s roles in the home and the market across many decades and even from one century to the next, or across very different societies. Cumulatively, his work yielded powerful conclusions, not only explaining trends in birth rates, but also showing that preferences for discrimination led to a tradeoff with profits.
STANFORD – Far too few governments rein in their countries’ bloated welfare states before disaster strikes.
That represents a genuinely remarkable shift.
The other half is returning those who can do so to gainful employment.
The higher the replacement rate and/or dependency ratio, the higher the tax rate needed to pay for the benefits.
STANFORD – Millions of people worldwide watched the athletic achievements at the Sochi Olympics and the opening and closing ceremonies’ majestic portrayals of Russian history and culture. But the cost was immense, the alleged corruption dispiriting, and the contrast with the political situation in nearby Ukraine alarming.
Canada and Mexico were transformed in this way by the 1987 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. On average, 40% of Mexican exports to the United States now have US content.
Water diversion in a difficult drought year, along with Governor Jerry Brown’s proposal for massive new infrastructure to send water south, has heightened tensions.
In the last two years, deficits and debt have stabilized.
None of these reforms has been sufficient to restore the stronger growth that Europe desperately needs.
Italy and Germany are headed toward a ratio of one retiree per worker; without more rapid GDP growth, new immigration policies, higher retirement ages, and efforts to stem the increase in welfare spending, taxes will inexorably rise from already damaging levels.
The politics of this approach will be difficult, particularly in the rich countries; but, structured properly, concerted structural reform could help to restore growth, which would feed back into healthier budgets, more jobs, better balance sheets, and less financial risk.
But the German consumer is a sideshow.
The United States, meanwhile, continues to run a sizeable current-account deficit of around $350-400 billion.
And, while some observers are calling for Germany to “end wage restraint” and thereby encourage higher household spending, this has actually happened already.
Improved regulatory conditions for long-term investments and savings would help.
Clearly, a coordinated effort to limit exchange-rate variations is advisable.
Is Europe bound for a similar fate?
Moreover, while mortgage debt rose sharply in some eurozone countries, the increase was moderate in others and completely absent in Germany.
But, contrary to popular belief, that lesson is not that the central bank should shift swiftly to expansionary monetary policy, as the ECB did at the beginning of the eurozone crisis.
Nonetheless, though monetary policy has not helped to kick-start growth in the eurozone, many observers continue to argue that, in order to help governments address their fiscal challenges, the ECB must launch quantitative easing (large-scale purchases of long-term assets).
Growing Green Cities
If cities are to reduce their carbon footprint, they will need massive investments in their infrastructure. Three-quarters of rich countries’ CO2 emissions come from just four types of infrastructure: power generation, residential and commercial buildings, transport, and waste management.
Banks have traditionally financed a large share of infrastructure outlays.
These obstacles apply to all infrastructure investments.
At a later point, they could move on to raise money in the capital market and fund sustainable infrastructure alongside other investors.
क्योंकि कोनज़ो को प्रारंभ में केंद्रीय तंत्रिका तंत्र में प्रेरक तंत्रकोशिका मार्ग तक सीमित रहनेवाले ऊर्ध्व प्रेरक तंत्रिका कोशिका रोग के रूप में ही माना जाता था, यह सुझाया गया था कि बोध संबंधी प्रभाव न्यूनतम होते हैं। लेकिन बाद में उभर कर आए विद्युत शरीरक्रिया विज्ञान साक्ष्य में यह सुझाया गया कि उच्च-स्तरीय मस्तिष्क कार्यप्रणाली भी प्रभावित हो सकती है। कोनज़ो से प्रभावित बच्चों में तंत्रिका-बोध संबंधी विकृतियों के प्रमाण प्रस्तुत करते समय मेरे सहकर्मी और मैंने कोनज़ो-प्रभावित परिवारों में रहनेवाले कोनज़ो-मुक्त बच्चों के उप-नैदानिक लक्षणों को भी सम्मिलित किया, यह निष्कर्ष स्मरणशक्ति और सीखने के अधिक विशेषीकृत तंत्रिकाबोध संबंधी परीक्षणों के अनुसार उनके कार्य-निष्पादन पर आधारित था।

The goal is a new agreement in 2015 to prevent average global temperatures from rising by two degrees Celsius, the level that the international community has deemed “dangerous” to human society.
There are grounds for cautious optimism.
Last year Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to phase out hydrofluorcarbons, a potent greenhouse gas.
None of this guarantees success.
दूसरा तत्व बुनियादी सुविधाएँ है जिसकी सभी प्रकार के आर्थिक विकास के लिए ज़रूरत होती है: सड़कें, पुल, बंदरगाह, और विद्यालय, और साथ ही बिजली और साफ पानी की विश्वसनीय आपूर्ति। भारत में अपर्याप्त बुनियादी सुविधाएँ होने के कारण उद्योग मजबूर हैं। कारखानों को सुचारू रूप से प्रचालन करने के लिए बिजली की विश्वसनीय आपूर्ति, निविष्टियाँ प्राप्त करने और उत्पादों का वितरण करने के लिए अच्छी सड़कें और रेलवे, और अगर उन्हें उन उत्पादों का निर्यात करना हो तो मालवाहक जहाज़ों के लिए बंदरगाहों और उच्च मूल्य की वस्तुओं और कारोबारी यात्रा के लिए विमानपत्तनों की ज़रूरत होती है। चीन के पास ये चीज़ें भारी मात्रा में हैं। भारत के पास नहीं हैं।


Relief agencies are blocked from operating where they are needed most.
This conflicted view aligns with public perceptions of the UN.
Nonetheless, their intervention came too late for the hundreds of civilians who were killed in the city of Duékoué.
In such an environment, the prospects for diplomacy are dim.
The attackers issued a clear demand: Kenya must withdraw the forces that it deployed two years ago as part of an international effort to drive al-Shabaab out of Somalia and return the country to government rule and a semblance of normal life.
We have heard many such stories in recent days.
It is important to understand what is at stake in this gruesome episode, not only for Kenya but for the region and beyond.
Over the past year, Darfur has spun out of government control.
But the narrow focus on the political and economic implications for Scotland and the UK – or, for that matter, the referendum’s decisive pro-union outcome – should not overshadow one of the more overlooked geopolitical trends of our time: the rise of small countries.
More established small countries also lead the rankings in other metrics.
Add to that measures like the quality of institutions, suitability to thrive in a globalized world, stability of economic output, and level of human development, and one can generate a country strength index, in which 13 of the top 20 performers are small, with the most successful being Switzerland, Singapore, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway.
The risk, of course, is that their voices become drowned out by larger entities, impeding their ability to do what is best for their own citizens.
And America’s income distribution is more unequal than most advanced countries’ – and is trending the wrong way.
What, then, accounts for the US economy’s relatively good performance in the post-crisis period?
Removing structural rigidities is easier said than done.
In the absence of the exchange-rate mechanism, resetting the system to allow the tradable sectors to generate growth involves painful relative deflation, a process that takes longer in a low-inflation environment.
Structural flexibility is not the whole answer; higher levels of public-sector investment would also help to generate sustainable recovery, especially in the advanced countries.
Though one should not conclude from this that growth and inequality are either unrelated or positively correlated, the unqualified statement that inequality is bad for growth does not really accord with the facts.
Intergenerational mobility is a key indicator of equality of opportunity.
In a generally meritocratic environment, outcomes based on creativity, innovation, or extraordinary talent are usually viewed benignly and believed to have far less damaging effects.
This arguably occurred in the 1920s, prior to the Great Depression; it certainly occurred in the US (and Spain and the United Kingdom) in the decade prior to the 2008 crisis.
Inclusion sustains social and political cohesion – and hence the very growth needed to help mitigate the effects of rising inequality.
But public investment is only one component of successful growth strategies.
A weakening euro will help.
A recent analysis for the US suggests that entitlements programs’ liabilities will hit the public budgets in about ten years.
The third missing ingredient is structural flexibility, which is needed for two reasons.
If investment in human capital is to keep up with the changing composition of employment, structural flexibility is needed.
With only a slight lag, complexity became manageable, and global supply chains’ linear model (something produced in country A is consumed in country B) gave way to a more complex model with more fragmented but more efficient supply networks.
This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.
An extreme form of this may be coming in the form of 3D printing, a technology that makes it possible to produce an astonishingly wide and growing range of products by printing them one layer at a time.
Re-localization will be seen everywhere, including lower-income countries.
The world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital.
In fact, the Spanish economy is a classic case of a defective growth pattern followed by a predictable, policy-assisted recovery that is driven (with a delay) mostly by the tradable sector.
In fact, there has been substantial post-crisis re-convergence toward German levels.
Though Spain and Italy are similarly depressed in terms of current growth and employment, especially for the young, two significant differences stand out.
Built-in rigidities impede adaptation and adversely affect growth and employment. 
In such economies, that pattern not only typically depended on leverage; it also enlarged the non-tradable side of the economy and shrank the tradable side.
The hard part of fully realizing potential growth is shifting the composition of domestic demand from consumption to investment without adding leverage.
The speed of structural adjustment is also strongly influenced by how easily employment can shift from an economy’s non-tradable to its tradable side and across segments of global supply chains.
Anyone familiar with China’s structural shifts on the supply and demand side will recognize some similarities with the German case.
Moreover, China’s relationship with the United States is deteriorating, owing to conflict over America’s foreign-policy “pivot” toward Asia and disputes over cyber security. China has already restricted access to its market for some US-based technology firms, and more such actions may follow.
China has no choice but to change its growth model.
Consider the telecommunications-equipment industry, which has been growing at more than 15% annually in the past couple of years.
Such complex structural changes cannot be perfectly synchronized and thus are likely to be accompanied by a dip in growth rates.
The recent downturn in France’s industrial output has created large trade deficits, and is undermining the competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises.
With no industrial good that still requires a large-scale labor force – and the communications and services industries unable to fill the gap – employment is shrinking and economic growth is stagnating.
Governments, in order to contain the fallout of the crisis, ran up public debt, including in countries whose balance sheets had already been weakened significantly by declining GDP growth.
But, in general, careful analysis of their various facets leads to some understanding of their causes and, in turn, to reasonably promising solutions.
It does not help that China’s economic growth, which provided a powerful boost to the region’s smaller economies in recent decades, has slowed considerably.
The United Nations is preparing its 21st climate conference, to be held in Paris in 2015, with world leaders knowing full well that it, too, will end in failure to conclude a comprehensive global agreement.
The good news is that the global public is increasingly supportive of international intervention in some cases.
Perhaps that will change, too.
Perhaps the strongest reaction came from Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer, who called the proposals “irresponsible and contrary to the interests of the European economy.”
By forbidding investment banks from holding cash deposits, Glass-Steagall helped to support more than a half-century of financial stability after World War II.
To prevent the crash from triggering another Great Depression, governments intervened with massive taxpayer-funded bailouts, causing public-debt burdens to swell further, reaching unsustainable levels in many developed economies.
The eurozone’s member states should never again have to face such costs.
In cities like Beirut and Baghdad, mixed neighborhoods have been homogenized, as Sunni and Shia seek shelter from sectarian attacks and civil war.
This was especially true in Syria, where the Alawite-dominated Baath Party fostered ties to Christians and other small communities by presenting itself as a bulwark of secularism and stability in the face of a supposedly threatening Sunni majority.
In addition to persecuting minorities, the Islamic State has set about erasing all physical traces of religious diversity. Its forces have demolished Sufi shrines, Shia mosques, Christian churches, and ancient monuments they consider to be remnants of a corrupt and profane past.
The recent international conference in London, aimed at supporting reforms in the Palestinian Authority and shoring up support for renewed negotiations with Israel, is one of those preliminary efforts.
Such integration cannot be achieved on a unilateral basis but only by programs adopted by the host and donor countries in co-operation with each other; nor can it be achieved in conditions where there is complete political and administrative separation between the populations which places them under exclusive controls and fails to acknowledge the human needs of community and conviviality.
The Middle East Meltdown and Global Risk
And while the recent nuclear deal with Iran may reduce the proliferation risk, the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran will provide its leaders with more financial resources to support their Shia proxies.
Even in the parts of Iraq now controlled by the Islamic State, oil production continues, with output smuggled and sold in foreign markets.
Third, prolonged misery and hopelessness for millions of Arab young people will create a new generation of desperate jihadists who blame the West for their despair.
The problem is that the conflict is not even close to being ripe for resolution.
If Palestine were a state, it would be judged to have failed.
Simply agreeing to an agenda for follow-up meetings would be an accomplishment.
The most critical barrier for Hamas and others should be a clear commitment to forego armed violence in the pursuit of political ends.
This is one such occasion.
For starters, we are again moving into what Henry Kissinger called the realm of “constructive ambiguity.”
Other senior Fatah officials have been banned from travel outside the West Bank, owing largely to their involvement in nonviolent protests.
One is that, if the current process fails, Obama might issue his own plan, which many expect would be a near-carbon copy of the proposal made by Bill Clinton’s administration in its last days ten years ago.
The coming months will show whether these public postures are negotiable, with obvious consequences for both parties and their relationship with the international community, especially the US.
The results should be read as a cautionary tale for those seeking instant gratification through regime change.
But there is scant evidence to suggest that sanctions have done anything to slow Iran’s nuclear program.
Distrust between Iranians and Arabs is even older than the Shia-Sunni divide; and, in an era that will most likely be remembered as one of weakened leadership throughout the region, Arabs view the nuclear talks as being about something far more fundamental than arms control.
NEW YORK – Amerika Serikat, Uni Eropa, dan beberapa lembaga yang dipimpin negara Barat seperti Bank Dunia berulang kali bertanya mengapa Timur Tengah tidak bisa memerintah sendiri.
Perilaku yang sama masih dijalankan sampai hari ini: pencopotan pemimpin Libya, Muammar Khadafi di tahun 2011, penggulingan pemimpin Mesir, Mohamed Morsi di tahun 2013, dan kini perang di Suriah melawan Presiden Bashar al-Assad yang masih berlangsung.
Pendekatan yang diterapkan sekarang melalui pembentukan koalisi yang dipimpin Amerika Serikat disebut “coalitions of the willing” tidak hanya gagal; tapi berarti bahkan tujuan-tujuan yang valid seperti menghentikan ISIS (Islamic State) dihambat oleh persaingan geopolitik.
Tanpa pendidikan berkualitas tinggi, sedikit peluang bagi terwujudnya kemakmuran ekonomi dan stabilitas politik di negara manapun.
The consequences are being felt most acutely in the Levant, where improved transport and trade reforms had strengthened economic ties between Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
The consequences for the region’s political economy are profound. Whatever weak constituency existed in support of regional trade has been marginalized by conflict.
RIYADH – Analysts the world over are assessing the situation in the Middle East in 2012 by listing the region’s “winners” and “losers.”
The victims of the conflicts in Syria, Iran, and Palestine; the friends and families of the victims; those who hope for peace: all lost.
Unlike some conflicts in the region, this is a case with a clear and simple solution.
Did the Americans defeat Saddam Hussein, and did more than 100,000 Iraqis die in the process, so that their country could become a puppet of the hostile Iranian regime? Iran’s meddling in Bahrain, Kuwait, Yemen, and other Gulf states must end as well.
The choice is simple: Do we want to be winners or losers?
Otherwise, the global development agenda could lose its relevance, and thus its grip on stakeholders.
In Bangladesh, for example, just 13% of households that receive remittances from abroad are below the poverty line, compared to 34% of non-remittance-receiving households.
Typically, development experts regard migration as a sign of failure: if development policies work, people should not want to move.
Such an agenda includes simple measures, like reducing fees for visas, and more complex reforms, like allowing migrants to switch employers without penalty and increasing the proportion of migrants who enjoy legal protections and labor rights.
But once glasnost let people say what they thought, many people said, “We want out.”
After all, he wanted to reform communism, not replace it.
Eventually, even the military became aware of the tremendous burden caused by imperial overstretch.
At the end of the twentieth century, the major technological change of the third industrial revolution was the growing role of information as the scarcest resource in an economy.
But it is also a mistake to discount the importance of leaders with humanitarian values.
इस स्थिति का सामना करने के लिए दृढ़ संकल्प के साथ उपाय करने होंगे. इनके बगैर पानी की मांग अनेक समाजों की खुद को परिस्थिति में ढालने की क्षमताओं को पार कर जाएगी. नतीजतन बड़े पैमाने पर आबादी का विस्थापन होगा, अर्थव्यवस्था ठप पड़ जाएगी, अस्थिरता व हिंसा फैलेगी तथा राष्ट्रीय व अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा को नया खतरा पैदा हो जाएगा.
अनेक कानूनी प्रावधान संयुक्त रूप से तथा मिलजुल कर लागू किए जा सकते हैं: रामसर कन्वेंशन ऑन वेटलैंड्स, यूएन कन्वेंशन टू कम्बैट डेजर्टिफिकेशन तथा यूएन फ्रेमवर्क कन्वेंशन ऑन क्लाइमेट चेंज कुछ ऐसे ही समझौते हैं. संयुक्तराष्ट्र वाटरकोर्सेज कन्वेंशन के विलंबित अमल को इसमें शामिल देशों के लिए अवसर के रूप में देखा जाना चाहिए. इससे उन देशों को प्रोत्साहन मिलना चाहिए जो अभी सहकारिता समझौतों से बाहर हैं कि वे इन मुद्दों पर गंभीरतापूर्वक कार्य करें.
Worse still, the economic, territorial, and military insurgency of the FARC guerrillas was growing stronger.
Likewise, although Uribe’s government approved the extradition of 304 Colombian nationals and 11 foreigners (most to the US) between 2002 and 2005, drugs-linked organized crime continues to thrive and expand in Colombia.
The implicit immunity from prosecution these groups received in exchange for their demobilization has done little to help.
The setback to the fragile gains of recent years, particularly in Africa, threatens to return millions of people to the extreme poverty from which they had just managed to escape.
Moreover, 536,000 women a year die in childbirth, and maternal health is also the one MDG progress towards which has stagnated since the targets were established 10 years ago.
By the end of 2010, four million African women will be screened, and tri-therapies treatment provided to 500,000 pregnant women worldwide.
Trials of war criminals were once serious business.
Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant.
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.
The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the “i”s of history were not yet fully dotted and history itself was on trial.
Until Tony Blair and Robin Cook became, respectively, Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom in 1997, four years after the ICTY was established, NATO troops in Bosnia failed to arrest indicted suspects even when they ran into them.
Jean Kambanda, former Prime Minister of Rwanda, pled guilty to crimes against humanity and genocide and is serving a life sentence in prison.
The ICTY’s mission is as valid and as vital as ever: to show that the era of impunity for some of humanity’s worst crimes is coming to an end.
Inspired by Friedman’s ideas, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and many other government leaders began to dismantle the government restrictions and regulations that had been built up over the preceding decades.
Let the government simply enforce property rights and contracts, and – presto! – markets can work their magic.
No single central authority coordinated their actions; that feat was accomplished by the magic of free markets and the price system.
China’s government has subsidized, protected, and goaded its firms to ensure rapid industrialization, thereby altering the global division of labor in its favor.
Markets are tools that, relative to the alternatives, happen to have great strengths with respect to incentives, efficiency, and innovation.
In a decentralized structure, redundancy tends to be undersupplied in the process of local optimization.
These differential outcomes reflect distinctive combinations of market forces and social contracts.
Experience in developing and advanced countries alike suggests that states with substantial and healthy balance sheets are better positioned to deal with today’s stability, distributional, and sustainability challenges.
Within today’s booming world economy, most developing countries have been growing rapidly.
Indeed, the recent boom in some parts of the developing world shows exactly that.
The same is true of foreign direct investment (FDI).
It also includes creating the regulatory and institutional framework that markets require to function well, providing necessary public goods and guaranteeing the fairness of rules.
China’s Measured Embrace of India
Partly motivated by a desire to counterbalance China’s rising geopolitical influence, Japan and the US have sought to draw India into a multilateral alliance consisting of democratic countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
Xi is confident that China can understand and satisfy many of Modi’s needs better than regional rivals like Japan.
As major aid providers and investors in Afghanistan, China and India also have common interests in stabilizing that country, and countering religious extremism and terrorism after NATO troops leave.
Indeed, the greater Middle East is becoming an ever greater focus of Chinese foreign policy.
To this end, Prime Minister Li Keqiang has proposed an economic corridor linking China to Pakistan, and has spoken of other corridors running through Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar.
Specifically, western provinces like Ningxia and Qinghai, which have substantial Muslim communities, could benefit from deeper links with Arab economies.
This is a daunting task, but it is one that can not only help to secure China’s long-term future, but perhaps bring greater weight to bear in resolving the region’s immense challenges.
The conventional wisdom is that the threat of prosecution serves Xi’s goals of consolidating power and compelling the bureaucracy to implement economic reforms that run counter to its interests. The two prongs of Xi’s political strategy – cleansing the Party and reinvigorating China’s economy – are thus complementary and interdependent.
What it does have is the capacity to influence ordinary Chinese – making them a valuable addition to a pro-reform coalition.
Outside China, the prevalent view among business leaders is that President Xi Jinping’s new administration has consolidated its power and acquired enough authority to push through far-reaching economic reforms.
Indeed, the fight against corruption is at war with itself, because Xi is simultaneously seeking to buttress one-party rule.
Only by mobilizing pressure outside the party-state can these insiders be forced to accept some of the decentralizing and liberalizing reforms that China’s economy needs.
Though these stories have yet to implicate Zhou directly, it will be only a matter of time before the Chinese government officially charges him with corruption.
Liu made his fortune with Zhou Bin’s help.
As of now, one minister, two provincial vice governors, one vice minister, and several senior executives in state-owned oil companies have been detained.
The truth is that, while Deng deserves appreciation for having brought China back from the abyss of Maoism, his approach – “Dengism,” or authoritarian developmentalism – is now impeding China’s prospects.
With leadership positions allocated – often for life – on the basis of personal connections, rather than merit, he understood that the system suffered from gross inefficiency, risk aversion, and a lack of technical expertise.
Its greatest political failure is its resistance to the democratic reforms needed to constrain that power.
One hopes that he continues to emulate Deng, without allowing his approach to become distorted by Dengism.
The unseemly race to recruit princelings starts at the world’s leading colleges and universities.
A place awarded to a less-qualified princeling is a place denied to a more qualified applicant.
In China, by contrast, pervasive corruption, the absence of a free press, and state capitalism mean that princelings’ conduct is unconstrained – and typically shrouded in secrecy.
Now she, and Cataphora, are applying those same analytics to a different market: people who want to analyze their own e-mail correspondence (and eventually other content) to see a reflection of their interactions with others.
Digital Mirror – along with a book written by Charnock called E-Habits, which serves as a kind of extended documentation – can be used for self-analysis or analysis of the local ecosystem.
For example, in a real-world office, you can see who goes out to lunch together or gossips at the water cooler, who has a line in front of their door, and so on.
Missile defense has suddenly emerged as a divisive issue in Europe.
Third, America underestimated the role of public opinion in Poland and the Czech Republic.
As Eastern European countries become more closely integrated into the EU, they increasingly have to calculate the impact of their policies on relations with Europe.
This approval cannot be taken for granted.
The US representatives were perplexed; the Europeans were shocked.
But we are light years away from a new Cold War.
Apparently, the US can’t decide whether to treat Russia as a rival power or a difficult partner.
However important NATO may be, it would be a dramatic admission of its own helplessness and insignificance if the EU were to remain silent on this crucial issue for Europe’s future.
No European country – not even the Big Three (France, Great Britain, and Germany) – can any longer assert its central foreign policy interests alone, outside of the common European framework.
This is obviously a hefty price tag – at least a 50% increase in the total cost of the EU – and it will likely be much higher (the Commission has previously estimated the cost to be double its current estimate).
In other words, if Barroso fears costs of 20% of GDP in the year 2100, the 0.5% payment every year of this century will do virtually nothing to change that cost.
It stops us from focusing on long-term strategies like investment in energy R&amp;D that would actually solve climate change and at a much lower cost.
The inaction argument makes us spend vast resources on policies that will do virtually nothing to deal with climate change, thereby diverting those resources from policies that could actually make an impact.
The rise of populist political parties of both the left and the right across the continent attests to popular frustrations and fears.
The challenge of caring for, employing, and integrating such numbers will soon run up against the limits of physical capacity, financial resources, and public tolerance.
Turkey would receive financial and military assistance in exchange for asserting greater control over its borders, while the question of Turkey’s long-term relationship with Europe would be set aside until the crisis passed.
NAIROBI – My mother, like her mother, her grandmother, and so on, was born into poverty in the rural village of Rarieda, Kenya.
But few have stopped to consider this shift’s implications for families like mine.
The world’s enduring perception of Africa as a village exacerbates slum dwellers’ plight, keeping them off the global development agenda.
For the sake of the millions of people like my mother – and, more important, for the sake of their children and grandchildren – we must fulfill the promise that attracts the poor to cities in the first place.
They also work hard to make a living in a country where median household income has declined to a level last seen in the mid-1990’s.
Instead, special interests compete for influence through campaign contributions and other forms of political donations.
According to a recent report on the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, prepared by Better Markets, an advocacy group that pushes for stronger financial reforms, the cost to the US economy of the financial crisis – caused by financial institutions’ reckless risk-taking – amounts to at least $12.8 trillion.
If only Romney had turned popular disdain for subsidies against the global megabanks, he would now be coasting into the White House.
More than 11 million additional jobs are needed to return the US to its pre-recession employment level.
With the possible exception of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, these changes would take considerable time to implement.
Based on what Romney has told us, we can conclude that his plan would exacerbate the public-investment deficit as well.
His plan would pay for lower income-tax rates by eliminating tax deductions like those for charitable giving and mortgages, while maintaining tax preferences for saving and investment.
President Barack Obama’s re-election marked a victory, limited but unmistakable, for the cause of fact.
When the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report in October showing that the national unemployment rate remained “essentially unchanged at 7.9%,” Republican operatives sought to discredit the highly respected BLS.
“President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans,” Romney told the Republican convention, and then paused, with the expectant smile of a comedian waiting for the audience to catch on to the joke.
Obama swung into action, now not just a suspect candidate but a trusted president whose services were sorely needed by the battered population of the East Coast.
The private sector, while central in a modern economy, cannot ensure its success alone.
Democracies rely on a spirit of trust and cooperation in paying taxes.
Indeed, it might be a Nixon-in-China moment: a wealthy politician at the pinnacle of power advocating higher taxes for the rich could change the course of history.
Romney may not be a tax evader; only a thorough investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service could reach that conclusion.
Most damaging, the ouster of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood government had deprived Hamas of its lifeline of supplies and armaments.
Such achievements shattered the indomitable image of the Israeli army, exposing a weakness that other radical Islamist groups may attempt to exploit.
Given Hamas’s leading role, it will be held accountable not only for the success of Gaza’s reconstruction, but also for any further delays in Palestinian reconciliation.
LONDON – My career as a businessman in Africa has turned me into an activist for better, cleaner government and for the rule of law.
This is the rule of law in action at the local level, and it is building, often from scratch, a culture in which disputes are settled peacefully and benefits distributed transparently.
The Changing Development Order
A similar picture prevails globally.
We have barely scratched the surface in integrating the efforts of development finance institutions (DFIs) with private and philanthropic initiatives, which could make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
Traditionally, development flows were unidirectional, going from the wealthy North to the impoverished South.
Models of Madness
Our children are labeled, too.
How did this simplistic, certainly unscientific, and frequently damaging approach gain such dominance?
Naturally, they encourage us to diagnose eating, sleeping, or feeling too much (or too little) as illnesses requiring a chemical cure.
The Misrule of Law
Currently, the anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of Putin’s regime, is being prosecuted for allegedly conspiring to embezzle from a state-owned timber firm, while Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in prison after accusing several Russian officials of large-scale embezzlement, is being tried posthumously on conspiracy charges.
This disturbingly common disconnect between official words and deeds devalues the rule of law in the eyes of the public.
For example, while Interpol recently rejected Russia’s request to pursue the investment banker William F. Browder (a fierce critic of the Russian government since the death of his lawyer, Magnitsky), it should apply Article 3 of its constitution, which bars it from participating in political matters, much more scrupulously.
MUNICH – At the World Economic Forum’s recent annual meeting in Davos, I participated in a panel of defense leaders to discuss the future of the military.
The second, which culminated in World War I, was driven by massed firepower, and is expressed in the saying, reportedly coined at the Battle of Verdun in 1916, “artillery conquers, infantry occupies.”
The insurgents in eastern Ukraine are fighting alongside Russian troops (bearing no insignias).
In China, for example, military planners developed a strategy of “unrestricted warfare” that combines electronic, diplomatic, cyber, terrorist-proxy, economic, and propaganda tools to deceive and exhaust US systems.
Modernization à la Carte?
But human rights and the rule of law began to re-emerge as a theme of Western policy, especially in the wake of the Helsinki Conference on European Security and Cooperation and its use by the administration of US President Jimmy Carter, as well as by numerous non-governmental advocates protesting the treatment of Soviet dissidents.
In particular, China’s breathtaking economic success seems to point to the existence of viable authoritarian alternatives to the Western idea that freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and the market economy are bound together.
Before too long, Russia’s “managed” (read: authoritarian) modernization will also have to allow for the rule of law and a functioning separation of powers, or the country will remain dependent on oil and gas prices and mired in a brutal struggle for power, influence, and money.
Modernizing the Middle East’s Economies
Indeed, oil rents eventually weaken state institutions, and this hollowing out of the state often gives rise to growing discontent. 
So what, then, are the possible policy options? The absence of a modern industrial base diminishes the WANA economies’ ability to absorb the surplus generated by oil revenues.
Its 2008 report Making the Law Work for Everyone argues that legal empowerment is not about aid, but about policy and institutional reforms that expand the legal opportunities and protection of the poor.
To be sure, China’s leaders fêted Modi in style.
Four years later, China revived its long-dormant claim to Arunachal Pradesh, and has since breached its border several times.
Many of the deals Modi made with business leaders in Shanghai – supposedly worth $22 billion – entail Chinese state-owned banks financing Indian firms to purchase Chinese equipment.
Without a new approach, the Sino-Indian relationship seems doomed to remain highly uneven and contentious.
Unlike Hans, he is genuine and dependable; they end up together.
It enjoys a significant amount of political independence. And it has not been shy about using its considerable operational autonomy.
And, only two weeks ago, an outgoing Fed governor, Jeremy Stein, declared that the Fed is in the middle of a policy transition that renders its guidance to markets “more qualitative,” “less deterministic” and, therefore, less precise.
So why have financial markets been behaving as if they were in a world of their own?
In order to kick-start progress, ECB President Mario Draghi has proposed a grand policy bargain to European governments: if they implement structural reforms and improve fiscal flexibility, the central bank will expand its balance sheet to boost growth and thwart deflation.
In India, the question is whether newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi will move decisively to fulfill voters’ high expectations for economic reform before his post-victory honeymoon is over.
In the next few months, the buoyant optimism pervading financial markets may prove to be justified.
And emerging economies will be anchored by China’s slower but still-robust 7% annual growth.
Meanwhile, exchange-rate appreciation is beginning to undermine exports in the eurozone’s core countries, particularly Germany, which has been the regional growth engine in recent years.
In China, for example, this involves less reliance on exports and public investment, and more on the private components of domestic aggregate demand.
The 2008 global financial crisis left the US economy mired in a low-level equilibrium, characterized by sluggish job creation, persistently high long-term and youth unemployment, and growing inequalities of income, wealth, and opportunity.
This is not to say that there has been no economic or financial progress in 2013. After all, economic growth, while unnecessarily held below potential by Congress (and vulnerable to decline if Congress is not careful), has again outpaced that of Europe.
The resulting sense of political drift and dysfunction has been exacerbated by the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) – a massive, avoidable distraction that has been allowed to cast doubt on this landmark initiative.
Mexico’s Breakout Moment?
As a result, there are only a few good historical examples – including China, Poland, and South Korea – of successful structural reforms.
They also note that Mexico’s impressive accomplishments in terms of macroeconomic stabilization, while necessary, have not proved sufficient to unleash the country’s growth potential.
Fortunately, the government has room for countercyclical policy, and has already responded with more accommodating fiscal and monetary policies.
But, rather than deploy their abundant cash in new investments to expand capacity and tap new markets – which they have been very hesitant to do since the global financial crisis erupted – many companies have so far preferred (or have been pressured by activist investors) to give it back to shareholders.
Successful innovation today is a lot less about financing and much more about finding the “killer app.” As a result, many companies, less convinced that “normal” innovation yields big payoffs, end up investing less overall than they did before.
NEWPORT BEACH – History is full of people and institutions that rose to positions of supremacy only to come crashing down.
With other policymaking entities sidelined by an unusual degree of domestic and regional political polarization, advanced-country central banks felt obliged to act on their greater operational autonomy and relative political independence.
In the eurozone, fiscal integration and pro-growth regional initiatives have essentially stalled, as have banking initiatives that are outside the direct purview of the European Central Bank.
But central banks cannot do it alone.
Yet national political support for the Bretton Woods institutions – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – seems to have reached an all-time low, undermining the global economy’s ability to meet its potential and contributing to geopolitical insecurity.
And, just a few weeks ago, the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) acted to bolster a currency-reserve pool to help ease short-term liquidity pressures and to establish their own development bank – a direct challenge to the IMF and the World Bank.
Another challenge to the international monetary system lies in the proliferation of bilateral payment agreements.
The repeated rejection by the US Congress of a much more limited set of reforms – which was approved by most other countries in 2010-12, imposes no incremental financial obligations on the US, and implies no reduction in America’s voting power or influence – is a case in point.
The Brothers dismiss those who have demonstrated in the streets during the past three weeks as Mubarak sympathizers.
In addition, the mosque of al-Azhar is promised an advisory role in Islamic legislation.
America’s main priority now is to ensure that the peace treaty with Israel is maintained.
Will it embrace a new Islamic authoritarianism, or build the democracy that Egyptians have risked their lives to secure?
Another obstacle to a peace agreement has been the division between Hamas-controlled Gaza and the Fatah-controlled West Bank.
Paradoxically, the discerning Palestinian observer may find comfort in America’s failure to stop Israel from expanding its settlements (and thus effectively annexing a growing share of Palestinian land), for it ends the charade on which the peace process has been based.
It is time, therefore, for the US to rethink its policy toward the Israel-Palestine conflict.
In this environment, sober, informed voices, like that of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank of central banks, should also be given a fair hearing.
And, under the public spotlight, some central bankers have sought to downplay the BIS’s assessment, arguing that it is all too easy to issue far-reaching policy recommendations when one suffers none of the consequences should one’s prescription turn out to be wrong.
Indeed, it serves policymakers well by challenging, debating, and perhaps swaying opinion.
The protests of April 2009 were triggered by the Communist Party’s claim to have won a third consecutive term in power, following an aggressive election campaign with widespread abuses.
Reckless populist promises left a gaping 16%-of-GDP budget deficit.
We will also sign a far-reaching free-trade agreement with the EU.
This makes Moldova the only post-Soviet state (aside from the Baltic countries) with an uninterrupted cycle of transfers of power through elections since 1991.
All of this points to the costly skills mismatch at play in today’s economy.
One-third of employers never interact with education providers, while only 15% do so once a month or more.
Governments can play a critical role in collecting the data needed to determine which skills are in demand and what kind of training is effective.
If the world continues on its current course, labor-market imbalances will worsen significantly in the coming years.
Even the most stability-obsessed countries have made unexpected moves.
Anticipating falling prices, households could postpone their consumption decisions, and companies could defer investment, pushing the economy into a downward spiral from which it would be very difficult to escape.
The "divergence" of economic performance and monetary policy among three of the world's most systemically important economies – the eurozone, Japan, and the United States – has added another layer of confusion for the rest of the world, with particularly significant implications for small, open economies.
But, given the danger that this poses, one hopes that they succeed.
Keynes's dictum has become the ruling wisdom of monetary policy (one of his few to survive).
Today, the collapse in the price of crude oil is probably the most significant factor driving inflation below target, just as in 2011 it was the rise in oil prices that drove it above target.
So what happens to the recovery if we fall into what is euphemistically called “negative inflation"? Until now, the consensus view has been that this would be bad for output and employment.
Thus, price deflation means debt inflation; and a higher debt burden means lower spending.
The implications go well beyond academia and policy circles.
Let me explain by going back to the end of the inflationary 1970’s, when President Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker to lead the Fed.
All of this risks serious skill atrophy.
If the target is missed repeatedly, as it has been, the governor must send a public explanatory letter to the government.
Money for Nothing
This increase has no separate climate effect, since we’ve already promised to cut emissions by 20%. However, it does manage to make a poor policy decision dramatically worse.
The last €500 million could fund an eight-fold increase in research and development aimed at improving CO2-efficient energy technologies, enabling everyone in the long run to reduce emissions much more dramatically, and at much lower cost.
The EU’s goal of a 20% reduction by 2020 is an incredibly expensive way to signal good intentions.  But wouldn’t we rather do real good?
This is also roughly the amount needed to fill the vast infrastructure gap that is preventing the world from addressing critical developmental challenges – from rapid urbanization to climate change and job creation.
First, developing countries must build effective institutions while enforcing good governance, transparency, and accountability. They must fight corruption, combat organized crime, and implement effective tax systems, which is even more critical in resource-rich countries.
Our work will benefit enormously from the current push for more international cooperation in curbing illicit financial flows.

अक्षय ऊर्जा के उत्पादन में वृद्धि से यह स्पष्ट हो गया है। लोग स्वच्छ ऊर्जा चाहते हैं, प्रौद्योगिकी उपलब्ध है और लाभदायक हैं, और, लाखों लोगों को विश्वसनीय बिजली प्राप्त न हो सकने के कारण, ऊर्जा के अक्षय स्रोतों का उद्भव एक संजीवनी के रूप में है। पवन और सौर ऊर्जा की वैश्विक क्षमता 2009 के स्तर से बढ़कर तीन गुना हो गई है, और नवीकरणीय ऊर्जा अब विश्व की विद्युत आपूर्ति के पांचवें हिस्से से अधिक उपलब्ध करती है।
One of the EU’s main architects, Jean Monnet, a French diplomat and economist, spent much of World War II in Washington, DC, as a negotiator for the European allies.
The other ideal was eternal peace.
The European ideal has parallels in other parts of the world.
In this, too, he was a man of his time.
In fact, it is the typical sentiment of a technocrat who lacks political sense.
Is Finance Too Competitive?
By contrast, if the industry were open to new players, potential entrants, with everything to gain and little to lose, would have a strong incentive to unleash the waves of “creative destruction” that Schumpeter thought so essential to human progress.
An analogy may be useful.
But patents are ineffective in some industries, like finance.
The problem was not with the innovation, but with how it was used – that is, with financiers’ incentives.
Why is this bailout happening in the world’s most avowedly capitalist country? Don’t venerable capitalist principles imply that anyone who believed in the real estate bubble and who invested in Fannie and Freddie must accept their losses?
Similar housing booms in many other countries are now ending, and they may face the pain – and the moral dilemmas – that the US economy is now experiencing.
People’s reactions to these events depend on their emotions and their sense of justice.
The gnawing problem is one of “good faith.”
A perception of unfair treatment can be deadly to economic growth, because it means that people will lose trust in businesses, and hence be less willing to offer to them their precious capital and labor.
In a triumph for parliamentary democracy, the motion passed without dissent.
Nowadays, China has its own animal-rights campaigners, and there are signs that their message is beginning to be heard.
The problem does not lie with voters, who, in states like Florida, Arizona, and California, have shown that they want farm animals to have better protection than the animal industries typically provide.
What Drives Moral Progress?
Everybody’s life is just as important as anybody else’s.”
In short, a stronger sense of empathy spurs moral progress.
In this sense, the notion of “us versus them” has been fundamental to human evolution, and it continues to shape our interactions.
Plato would reject this view.
Traditional morality faded away as technology multiplied productive power.
Theological language that might have decried the credit crunch as the “wages of sin,” a come-uppance for prodigious profligacy, has become unusable.
Whereas guarding against uncertainty had traditionally been a moral issue, hedging against risk is a purely technical question.
The prudential supervision regime initiated by the Bank of Spain in response to the Spanish banking crises of the 1980’s and 1990’s shows what a sensible middle way might look like.
The possibility of being unable to put food on the table fills parents with a deep sense of foreboding.
For example, access to international food supplies allowed Saudi Arabia to abandon its 30-year program of subsidies for domestic wheat production.
Most people are surprised to learn how shallow international grain markets truly are.
To put it simply: when it comes to tackling food security, trade is part of the solution, not part of the problem.
Nuclear deterrents could have failed at any moment.
It remains to be seen whether today’s leaders will do the same.
In 1989, incredible changes that were deemed impossible just a few years earlier were implemented.
From Terror to Counterterror in North Africa
According to the Moroccan North Observatory of Human Rights, only 16 Moroccan jihadists traveled to Syria and Iraq in the first six months of this year.
And, indeed, as the UN report underscored, Daesh remains skilled at using social networks to attract and indoctrinate young people across the region.
To confront terrorism in North Africa and beyond, Morocco will have to continue to address the threat from all angles: intelligence, law enforcement, and social policy.
For these activists, such linkages were intended to maintain control over women, and were part of Moroccan society, not Islam.
The growing significance of the veil also highlighted important differences between men and women in Morocco.
Thus, in Morocco, it is difficult to speak of separate “secular” and “Islamic” feminisms.
With President Putin recently completing a Middle East tour to flex Russia’s diplomatic muscles and sell arms, now is a good moment to assess his country’s influence in the region.
There is a growing fear in Moscow that the US administration is now looking at Russian companies with similar ties to Iran and its nuclear ambitions.
But the only thing that Russia appears to be concerned about is that, whatever successor regime emerges, it is willing to do the Kremlin’s bidding.
वाशिंगटन, डीसी – मलेरिया के ख़िलाफ़ लड़ाई में जो लोग अगली कतार में हैं उनके लिए इस परजीवी के ख़िलाफ़ टीके के विकास की ख़बर रोमांचक घटना है। 2013 में इस रोग से 584,000 मौतें हुई थीं, जिनमें से लगभग 90% उप-सहारा अफ्रीका में हुई थीं; मरने वालों में 78 प्रतिशत पांच वर्ष से कम उम्र के बच्चे थे। जिन 97 देशों में मलेरिया महामारी है, उनमें यह इलाज और देखभाल तक सीमित पहुंच वाले उन ग़रीब लोगों की आर्थिक उत्पादकता को तहस-नहस कर देता है जो उसे सबसे कम बर्दाश्त कर सकते हैं।
इसके अलावा किसी टीके की प्रभावकारिता बनाए रखने के लिए तीन शुरूआती खुराक़ों के बाद एक बूस्टर देने की ज़रूरत होती है। इसके बिना कारगरता घट कर असुरक्षित स्तरों तक चली जाती है। क्या सरकारें सचमुच इस पर लाखों डालर ख़र्च करना चाहेंगी?
WASHINGTON, DC – The financial crisis that began in 2007 has been persistently marked by muddled thinking and haphazard policymaking.
The automakers are also the backbone of American manufacturing, driving advances in manufacturing technology that will be needed if America is to be a world leader in the coming “green” transportation revolution.
Opposition to the bailout is bringing back to the surface the worst of the conservative economic thought that got America and the world into this mess in the first place.
There are undoubtedly colossal problems in Detroit, and the bosses of the Big Three automakers could never be convicted of an excess of imagination.
To attribute the Swiss vote to ban minarets – an idea that was promoted by the right-wing Swiss People’s Party, but by none of the other political parties – to “Islamophobia” is perhaps to miss the point.
Foreign travel was for soldiers, diplomats, and rich people.
Populist demagogues blame political, cultural, and commercial elites for the anxieties of the modern world. They are accused, not entirely without reason, of imposing mass immigration, economic crisis, and loss of national identity on ordinary citizens.
The Pope has an answer, of course.
They weaken it by undermining our elected representatives, whose job is to exercise their good judgment rather than voice the gut feelings of an anxious, angry people.
But LGIVs obtained a massive amount of financing in 2012 by issuing bonds and trust loans.
The risk stemming from local-government debt is exacerbated further by massive amounts of non-explicit debt acquired through arrears, credits, and guarantees.
Indeed, it is increasingly common for banks’ off-balance-sheet lending to exceed newly issued balance-sheet credit.
China also needs a new financing model for infrastructure projects.
It wasn’t after a long illness, or even after a car crash.
Until I had these conversations, I didn’t really believe that Kris had died.
But that wasn’t Kris, fleeing some kind of sad life.
We communicated by e-mail, but mostly face-to-face a few times a year, ever since we met.
Indeed, Kris will live on much more effectively – and more accessibly to all her friends.
This means that for the first three years of a presidency brought to power amidst great popular demands, López Obrador would be able to enact little reform legislation.
If more evidence emerges, democratic prudence councils a complete recount.
Before a no confidence vote can be held, agreement must be reached on a new government majority to take its place.
In these circumstances, the model functions as classic presidentialism (even if it does not produce legislative majorities).
Accumulating excessive debt usually entails moving some part of domestic aggregate demand forward in time, so the exit from that debt must include more savings and diminished demand.
Consider southern Europe.
Several possibilities – not mutually exclusive – come to mind.
Then there is the time dimension.
Experience can be a harsh, though necessary, teacher.
It is a Spanish-German-French-British-Thai co-production, the kind of international collaborative effort we are increasingly seeing in film – a form of cross-border collaboration that should point the way to other forms of global civil-society projects.
In response, the mayor of Cannes organized a ceremony to commemorate all victims of the French-Algerian conflict.
In most cases, the directors researched their own films by interviewing sources who were close to the action, or close to the main events at a grassroots level.
It may be his last before he hands over power to his apparently designated successor, Vice President Xi Jinping, in 2012 – coincidentally the same year that President Barack Obama will be campaigning for a second term in the White House.
For the rest of us, the key question is whether America and China will be increasingly acrimonious competitors or cooperative partners, albeit with very different political systems.
There must be some explanation for China choosing this moment even for an unnecessary and ham-fisted row with the Vatican.
Iran’s oil and gas should not blind China to the dangers to its neighborhood and the entire world if the Islamic Republic develops a nuclear weapon.
Yet this is the direction in which Chancellor Merkel seems to be heading.
Second, German “exports” go mainly to the EU.
The French government, on the other hand, fears that the Germans’ commitment to eurozone stability is a ploy aimed at pushing France into a corner and leaving it behind economically.
Coordination within the eurozone – above all between its most important economies, France and Germany – is therefore all the more important.
“That is why we are so proud of it.”
Following the March 19 referendum, in which most Islamists campaigned for a package of constitutional amendments and got 77% support, secularists took to the streets, mobilizing behind their own demands.
Their belief in the superiority of literal interpretations of Islamic texts and their deep animosity towards religious innovation (broadly defined) reflect their certainty that the first three generations of Muslims possessed the best understanding of Islam, and should provide guidance for future generations.
Enforcing a secular constitution before elections does not guarantee a secular outcome.
The impact has become impossible to ignore.
Along with regulatory capture, this harmed competitiveness, market openness, and Egypt’s small and medium-size businesses.
This would be not only fair, but it also would teach an important lesson to those who bankroll dictators – a lesson that is likely to have an immediate positive impact worldwide.
Muddling Out of Freefall
Even the Congressional Budget Office is predicting that it will be the middle of the decade before unemployment returns to more normal levels, as America experiences its own version of “Japanese malaise.”
His attempts to please everyone, so evident in the last few weeks, are likely to mollify no one.
And, without that, more likely than not, the economy will face another crisis in the not-too-distant future.
Unfortunately, the problem runs a lot deeper than a few bad drugs sold at the corner pharmacy. Around $75 billion of substandard drugs are sold annually, causing an estimated 100,000 deaths worldwide, and making many more people seriously ill.
It is therefore imperative to develop new detection technologies that will work in poorer countries, and that complement existing systems such as bar codes.
November’s Diplomatic Harvest
The new European Commission took office on November 1, launching its mandate with a plan to boost public and private investment by €315 billion ($392 billion) over the next three years. Similarly, in Brisbane, the G-20 approved a package of economic measures to boost global economic growth by 2.1 percentage points by 2018.
The Obama administration has estimated that, once applied, this agreement – which was frozen for a year as China sought to protect its domestic industry – will increase annual global GDP by $190 billion.
In Jerusalem, mounting tension over holy sites has highlighted the difficulty of moving the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward.
Some important economies are still fighting deflation.
Fiscal policy should be focused on promoting growth and creating jobs, while maintaining medium-term credibility.
Most important, the culture of the financial sector needs to change.
We will need to update, adapt, and deepen our methods of working together.
Against this backdrop, the adoption of the IMF reforms by the United States Congress would send a long-overdue signal to rapidly growing emerging economies that the world counts on their voices, and their resources, to find global solutions to global problems.
This program, like so many educational or cultural Israeli-Palestinian partnerships, began in starry-eyed idealism.
But then reality intervened again.
One quote from a Palestinian TV production team member stayed with me: “This is a shotgun wedding,” he explained when he was advocating for a Palestine-only Sesame Street. “And we want a divorce.”
In the Sesame Street of Palestine and Israel, the failure of the joint venture was really a success: the Muppets and their creators have given us another valuable lesson, this time in how – and how not – to help others.
He blames French society. More specifically, he blames the fact that young Frenchmen of Muslim origin are marginalized on the grounds of their faith and the color of their skin.
They never became sufficiently French. Immigrants must be forced to share “Western values.”
The appeal of Islamist extremism may have been its glorification of violence more than any religious content.
Still, most enthusiasts of this type of entertainment do not actually go out and kill people.
Suppressing violent pornography will not get rid of rapists or high-school killers.
Since the two countries’ separation is now more than six decades old, that anomaly is unlikely to be repeated.
It was a low point in Indo-Pakistan relations, and no one in Delhi was prepared to trust Musharraf ever again.
If Musharraf had previously been unwilling to choose sides, the attempts to kill him finally showed him which side he had to be on.
Musharraf’s fraying authority made him less effective and, indeed, less useful: the Taliban re-emerged in strength on Pakistan’s Afghan border, and his own ISI was proved to have been involved in the bombing of India’s embassy in Kabul.
General Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12, 1999, when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious “nation-building” project.
A series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region.
While he announced that he would leave his military position “if” he was elected president, his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary.
Nor can a weak, embattled, and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan.

Indeed, the infinite renewal of the body isn’t confined to superficial repairs through cosmetic surgery.
Most people are shocked when they learn that one-fifth of the human genome has been patented, mostly by private firms.
The stem cell debates often seem to be premised on the assumption that only the status of the embryo matters.
(Pioneers for Communism, like Che we shall be!)," we repeated day after day before starting class.

DAVOS – The future of the global economy will depend greatly on whether President Barack Obama launches a comprehensive and coherent set of measures, and on how successfully he carries them out.
The effort to pump the American economy full of money will run into difficulties on two fronts: the exchange rate and interest rates.
The euro headed lower right from the beginning of 2009 and it was even outpaced by sterling.
The owners of wealth may increasingly turn to the yen and gold for safety but the may run into resistance from the authorities—sooner in the case of the yen than gold.
It is difficult, but not impossible, to imagine the U.S. economy growing at a rate of 3 percent or more in the decade ahead.
China
That will not be easy for either side.
Remittances from the Gulf States will suffer and its outsourcing business will languish, but hopefully infrastructure investments, of which India has a great backlog, will continue apace.
A New NATO plan ought to call for an orderly exit, but that is not possible while al Qaeda and the Taliban are gathering strength.
Some of the major oil-surplus countries, notably Iran, Venezuela, and Russia, have been enemies of the current world order, and their wings are being trimmed.
The first group was decimated by the financial crisis; the second was left relatively unscathed.
The key to Europe’s ability to neutralize Russia’s geopolitical advantage is to establish a unified energy policy, with a Europe-wide distribution network and a Europe-wide regulatory authority that has precedence over national regulators.
Therefore the odds favor that the euro will emerge from the current crisis with the ECB given greater powers over the banking system.
Mexico has a serious security problem because of drug trafficking.
A groundswell of new international initiatives will soon emerge to move this agenda forward.
In addition, Australia and Japan have launched a major international commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  My own multimedia “WMD—WeMustDisarm!” campaign, which will culminate on the International Day of Peace (21 September), will reinforce growing calls for disarmament by former statesmen and grassroots campaigns, such as “Global Zero.”
My fourth point addresses accountability and transparency.  Countries with nuclear weapons should publish more information about what they are doing to fulfill their disarmament commitments.  While most of these countries have revealed some details about their weapons programs, we still do not know how many nuclear weapons exist worldwide.  The UN Secretariat could serve as a repository for such data.
Best of luck to you as you leave the academy for your chosen professions in finance.
Young finance professionals need to familiarize themselves with the history of banking, and recognize that it is at its best when it serves ever-broadening spheres of society.
Those of you deciding to pursue careers as economists and finance scholars need to develop a better understanding of asset bubbles – and better ways to communicate this understanding to the finance profession and to the public.
The world needs you to succeed.

Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it, and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.”
Japan is deploying vast government aid and private-sector engagement reminiscent of its investments in China at the height of Japanese global economic power in the 1980’s.
John Pang, the Chief Executive of CARI, a research organization based in Malaysia, says that today’s transitional Myanmar/Burma is “a game the Chinese gave away.”
This is the lesson of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which celebrates its 20th birthday this year.
Canada also benefited.
“We’re not just selling things to each other,” explains Serra Puche. “Now, we’re producing things jointly.”
John F. Kennedy launched what became the Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and Bill Clinton helped secure congressional passage of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which had been initiated and negotiated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.
Indeed, if there was ever a moment for Congressional approval of the IMF reform package, this was it: the measure would have greatly increased the IMF’s ability to support Ukraine, a key American objective, at a much lower cost than the alternative of a US bilateral credit guarantee.
Whereas wealthy countries hold the most World Bank shares, borrowing countries hold a slight majority of the shares (and the presidency) at the regional banks.
In short, an internationally diminished US is loath to relinquish its dominance of global institutions, yet unwilling to shoulder the associated financial and political costs.
Over time, these arrangements will erode the US dollar’s role as the world’s leading reserve currency.
On economic, financial, tax, trade, and climate issues, many people around the world are fearful or angry, believing&nbsp; that a worldwide cabal of bankers, corporations, and G-20 elites uses insider deals to monopolize the benefits of globalization.
True, global “government” can go too far – for example, when WTO rules conflict with sensible local environmental safeguards, or when IMF requirements for developing-country borrowers narrow the scope for creative heterodoxy in growth and poverty-reducing policies. It is also true that countries dependent on official aid and IMF loans can face unwarranted pressure to conform to outsiders’ wrongheaded policy views – from premature opening of capital markets in Asia in the 1990’s to force-fed austerity in Greece and Spain today.
Moreover, fair global rules can help to “democratize” the global market, especially if they are embedded in institutions with a degree of autonomy for highly professional staff who can act with some independence from short-term political pressures. It should come as no surprise that the anti-globalists’ erstwhile punching bags – the World Bank and, increasingly, the IMF and the WTO – are more open and transparent than many of their member states.
Superficially, it may seem as if we have reached that breakthrough moment at which gender is no longer the most important issue.
Most intriguingly of all, Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, is now in a neck-and-neck race with another woman, Marina Silva.
Similarly, African-American leaders sometimes joke wryly about gaining the reins of municipal power just when a city is about to go bankrupt.
Appalling wages are just the start.
Today, it relies mainly on low-wage farmworkers from Haiti, Mexico, Guatemala, and other Central American countries – a change that owes much to two decades of trade liberalization.
That changed when activists began targeting the multinational corporations at the top of the pyramid, rather than the growers (who are now merely middlemen squeezed by global companies).
By leveraging their massive purchasing power, big multinational food corporations drive down prices, not only impoverishing farmworkers, but also eroding the profits of the growers who employ them.
The founders have deep roots in news media, social media, and technology: Katharine Zaleski is former Executive Director of the digital Washington Post and the first news editor of the Huffington Post; Milena Berry is former Chief Technology Officer of Avaaz.org, the global donations platform.
“She said, ‘I am starting this company.
Their goal is to change the nature of work across the board for women.
“Thirty percent of women in many countries in the Middle East have university degrees,” Zaleski explains, but they often cannot get jobs commensurate with their training for cultural reasons.
That is good news for anyone, male or female, who has young children or aging parents – or simply wants a more balanced life.
Had Al Gore maintained her husband’s high margin among women in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996, the Supreme Court would not have decided his 2000 election fight with George W. Bush.
The term “glass ceiling” is itself elitist, deriving as it does from the corporate struggles of a few professional women.
At a time of ever-increasing income disparity in America, is it not a serious political flaw in any presidential candidate not to know how to speak sensitively about wealth and poverty? And, given diminishing government transparency in the US and more and more secret law, is it not a serious issue that a presidential candidate will not address his or her mistakes and shortcomings?

कर के मोर्चे पर, एक प्रमुख घोषणा की गई है: अगले चार वर्षों में कॉर्पोरेट टैक्स की दर 30% से कम करके 25% की जाएगी, जिससे निजी क्षेत्र के निवेश को प्रोत्साहन मिला है। वस्तु और सेवा कर - जो एक तरह का मूल्य वर्धित कर है जिसके बारे में सरकार ने सराहनीय प्रगति की है - का कार्यान्वयन एक बड़ी उपलब्धि होगी और इससे अर्थव्यवस्था को बहुत अधिक प्रोत्साहन मिलेगा। तथापि, व्यय में भारी वृद्धि किए जाने के बावजूद, बजट देश के राजकोषीय घाटे को उचित सीमा के भीतर रखने के लिए मुख्य रूप से विकास और अधिक कर संग्रह पर निर्भर करता है।
PARIS – Before the second round of France’s regional elections on Sunday, most predictions suggested that five, perhaps six, of the country’s regional governments would fall into the hands of the National Front (FN).
But what caused the nation to right itself?
On the contrary, a sufficient number of voters came to understand that in that very anger – in its spokespeople and in the words used to express it – lurked a threat to the republic, to democracy, and to the nation’s fundamental values.
There have been other times in France’s history when entire segments of the electorate have ejected themselves from the game, without the rest of the players rushing over to beg them to get back on the field.
And, because those who believed this (virtually everyone whose voices were heard) belatedly perceived its insulting connotation, discussing the matter has caused considerable anguish in the years since.
And, precisely because nationalism shapes the way we think, its role in phenomena that do not trumpet their nationalist motivation – like Al Qaeda’s attacks in 2001 – can easily be overlooked.
In an advanced modern society, such as Germany, intellectuals have no difficulty using openly nationalist language to convince a nationally conscious populace of threats to national prestige.
For the time being, the Chinese may be too preoccupied with their own backyard to pay attention to such insults, but it is foolish to offend them deliberately.
In this bi-polar system, the parties differed on the nuances of economic policy, but broadly agreed on democratic values, the European project, and the need to adapt to and manage globalization, rather than reject it wholesale.
Meanwhile, many people in Europe face greater economic insecurity, owing to new technologies or competition from lower-cost workers elsewhere.
Meanwhile, the rise of identity-driven political movements presents a huge challenge for Europe’s traditional political parties.
NATO After Istanbul
At the request of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, NATO decided to offer to help train Iraqi security forces.
The allies decided to accelerate their efforts to equip NATO with the forces and technologies it needs to perform twenty-first century missions, from the Balkans to Afghanistan.
We also launched the "Istanbul Cooperation Initiative," to offer practical security-related cooperation to countries in the broader Middle East.
But that Cold War world is long gone.
This became particularly important after the Al Qaeda attacks on September 11, 2001, shifted the focus of American foreign policy toward transnational terrorism.
Hamid Karzai’s government remains weak, and the economy continues to be heavily dependent upon opium production. The Taliban and Al Qaeda networks are re-emerging as political and military threats.
NATO Must Be Saved
That is also why the modest efforts now being undertaken by the alliance to assist America in trying to stabilize Iraq will not stitch NATO back together again.
True, their security from military attack is currently no longer at stake. But NATO is more than just a defense pact.
That dangerous indifference is the most serious sign of NATO's crisis.
The transition plan cements that strategic shift.
Although Pakistan is now the largest recipient of US aid in the world, the Failed States Index2010, created by Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace, ranks the country 10th, between Guinea and Haiti.
A withdrawal of US and other NATO troops will not mean the end of the war, because the enemy will continue to target Western interests, wherever they may be.
Greece vehemently opposed its tiny northern neighbor – with only two million inhabitants – using the name Macedonia and symbols from the days of Alexander the Great in its flag and crest.
In other words, Russia is being allowed to re-assert its “sphere of influence” – a concept that should have been superceded by that of “Europe Whole and Free,” which the entire European Union appeared to have embraced when communism collapsed.
The crux of the matter is Europe’s lack of political will to forge a unified stand toward Russia.
After all, the recent military escalation in the region is at least partly due to that strategy.
It will not hide the fact that Israel has run out of unilateral options.
But that can no longer be an argument against diplomacy now that Israeli unilateralism has once again proven to be a strategic blind alley.
Finally, we also know that the leaders of this fanatical tide are few, but now have the sympathy of millions of ordinary Muslims.
There is also no shortage of images of abused prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison or the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, which have likewise done more to recruit new adherents to Islamic fanaticism than any sermon in a radical mosque.
Police actions must be merciless, even if this means more controls and surveillance.
The agenda appears straightforward, but “Paris III” has acquired a barely concealed political purpose: to bolster the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora in the face of a powerful domestic challenge led by Hezbollah, and by extension to curb the influence of Hezbollah’s regional backers, Syria and Iran.
The West should also recognize that the constituencies of Hezbollah and its allied, largely Christian, Free Patriotic Movement, led by presidential contender Michel Aoun, will be hit hardest by many of Siniora’s proposed economic and administrative reforms, such as lifting fuel subsidies and sharply raising value added tax.
Need Versus Greed
China’s economy is growing at around 10% annually.
Our planet will not physically support this exponential economic growth if we let greed take the upper hand.
The great aquifers that supply water for irrigation are being depleted.
The rise in food prices is leading to a land grab, as powerful politicians sell foreign investors massive tracts of farmland, brushing aside the traditional land rights of poor smallholders.
NEW YORK – Baruch Spinoza, the seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher, Benjamin Disraeli, the nineteenth-century British prime minister, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the twenty-first century French president, have one thing in common: all were sons of immigrants.
We who live in rapidly aging societies, such as Western Europe or Japan, still need immigrants.
Islamist extremism is a handy revolutionary creed for vulnerable young people to latch onto, to gain a sense of power and belonging.
Children of guest workers feel unwanted.
This means working out what jobs need to be filled, and welcoming those who will fill them, not as guests, but as equal citizens.
In other words, negative nominal rates merely make your return more negative than it already was.
If you were holding Swiss franc assets at a negative nominal return right before its central bank abandoned its euro peg in mid-January, you could have made a 20% return overnight; a negative nominal return is a small price to pay for a large capital gain.
Indeed, if the advanced economies were to suffer from secular stagnation, a world with negative interest rates on both short- and long-term bonds could become the new normal.


They are part of a people of whom another 1.3 million live in Israel, and another two million in the West Bank.
In the end, Sharon and then Binyamin Netanyahu both ended up sitting down at the negotiating table with Yassir Arafat and his representatives to try to reach an agreement.
But at least we will know that we are not fighting for an impossible objective that can only result in blood and devastation – blood and devastation that will weigh on the collective memories of the sons and grandsons of our neighbors, who will remain our enemies, even if the spinning top continues to turn.
In 2009, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer campaigning against corruption, died in prison after being denied medical care for life-threatening conditions.
His popularity now stands at 86%.
In 1934, Joseph Stalin, too, ordered a thorough investigation into the murder of a rival: Sergei Kirov, the head of the Communist Party in Leningrad.
Will Putin, like Stalin, unleash his own great terror, and murderously pursue supposed adversaries? Or will Nemtsov's death finally move complacent and obedient Russians to action?
Centuries of inculcation with Confucianism was as important to the rise of East Asia’s hyper-growth economies as the conjunction of Protestantism and the rise of capitalism was to the west.
Neo-Confucianism provided the basic ideology for China’s admiring neighbors – Japan, Korea, and Vietnam – until the advent of the West.
Periodic civil strife and rebellion were not eliminated, but only in Vietnam was the longevity of a dynasty a cloak for inextinguishable internecine warfare.
The emperor was the supreme paterfamilias, his benevolent rule reciprocated by the obedience of his ministers and subjects, while family members were fixed in their appropriate hierarchical relationships.
Better for the West to accept equality now – and struggle to maintain it.
The deadlock spilled over into the country's politics, with shifting coalitions forming four successive governments that collapsed within months, each time in a welter of recrimination from the parties that had been excluded.
The opposition Maoist-Madhesi alliance wants the decision rule to be consensus, whereas the exasperated government proposes requiring a two-thirds majority.
The monarchists are hoping for a return to absolutism. Centralists view federalism as a fig leaf for secession.
But Nepal's political landscape is showing no sign of a thaw.
More than 16,000 schools have been damaged, including some 5,000 that were completely destroyed.
Indeed, only a fraction of humanitarian aid budgets, roughly 1%, is allocated to education.
Schools provide more than the skills that children will need in later life; they also serve as vehicles for disseminating lifesaving health and safety information.
Its bloody ten-year civil war, however, was seldom in the international limelight.
For these groups, the restoration of democracy was a step toward social transformation, enabling them to participate more equally in the life of the country.
But the biggest challenges go to the roots of the insurgency: poverty, injustice, and discrimination.
Kewajiban Net-Zero
Semakin cepat kita mematikan keran, semakin rendah suhu yang menstabilkan iklim, semakin kecil risiko yang harus dihadapi, dan semakin sedikit biaya yang harus dikeluarkan untuk adaptasi pemanasan bumi.
Akan tetapi beberapa teknologi “pembuangan CO2” masih pada tahap pengembangan yang masih dini.
Pada bulan Mei 2015, Kamar Dagang Internasional (International Chamber of Commerce) dan para Direktur Utama/CEO dari seluruh dunia menyerukan emisi nihil.
"शुद्ध-शून्य उत्सर्जन" एक ऐसा नवीनतम "समाधान" उभरकर सामने आया है जो तथाकथित "कार्बन अभिग्रहण और भंडारण" पर निर्भर करता है। हालाँकि प्रौद्योगिकी को अभी भी थोड़ी-बहुत कमियों का सामना करना पड़ रहा है, जलवायु परिवर्तन के अंतर-सरकारी पैनल (IPCC) के अध्यक्ष राजेन्द्र पचौरी ने पिछले महीने एक अत्यंत समस्यात्मक वक्तव्य जारी किया, जिसमें उन्होंने कहा कि “कार्बन अभिग्रहण और भंडारण (CCS) के साथ यह पूरी तरह संभव है कि जीवाश्म ईंधनों का उपयोग बड़े पैमाने पर किया जाना जारी रहे।”
किसी भी स्थिति में, कार्बन अभिग्रहण और भंडारण (CCS) का कोई भी रूप पूर्ण अकार्बनिकरण की ओर संरचनात्मक बदलाव के लक्ष्य को आगे नहीं बढ़ाता है, जिसके लिए सामाजिक आंदोलनों, शिक्षाविदों, आम नागरिकों, और यहाँ तक कि कुछ नेताओं द्वारा अधिकाधिक माँग की जा रही है। वे संक्रमण के दौरान होनेवाली असुविधाओं और त्यागों को स्वीकार करने के लिए तैयार हैं; वास्तव में, वे शून्य-कार्बन अर्थव्यवस्था तैयार करने की चुनौती को नवीनीकरण और अपने समाजों और समुदायों में सुधार लाने के एक अवसर के रूप में देखते हैं। इस तरह के किसी प्रयास में खतरनाक, गुमराह करनेवाली, और दिवा-स्वप्नों वाली प्रौद्योगिकियों का कोई स्थान नहीं है।
Had he not fueled global hysteria over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the crippling international sanctions regime that eventually pushed Iran to a deal might never have been implemented.
Despite the obvious problems with Netanyahu’s position, dismissing it would be a mistake.
In this Hobbesian worldview, the threats can stem from virtually any development – political, strategic, or otherwise – and amount to existential challenges to the entire Jewish nation.
Israel’s Labour Party, which is now debating whether to join Netanyahu’s government, should consider carefully whether it can bring about such a shift.
Two former Mossad directors joined a chorus of Israelis in arguing that he should no longer be prime minister.
Such beliefs, of course, have been around for much longer than the modern state of Israel.
There is some truth to this view.
And a tougher US stance toward its ally might force the Israelis to try harder to come to terms with the Palestinians.
The Zionist Union, the principal opponent of Netanyahu’s Likud party, focused mostly on domestic issues like housing, the high cost of living, and growing economic inequality.
That is a tragedy, because it drives both sides into a cycle of action and reaction that ultimately will make impossible a negotiated two-state solution – the kind of solution in which each side gives up something it wants in order to gain something that both sides want more.
If the Palestinians fail, they will most likely turn again to violence: a third intifada, bigger and with greater international support than the first two.
And then run?
In an era of ballistic missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, and in which the planned Palestinian state is supposed to be demilitarized, why is it so vital for Israel to see its army “sit along the Jordan River”? If such a tripwire is really necessary, why shouldn’t a reliable international force carry out that task?
The son of a renowned historian who served as the personal secretary of Zeev Jabotinski, the founder of the Zionist right, Netanyahu absorbed from childhood his father’s interpretation of Jewish history as a series of tragedies.
Let us not avert our eyes lest our arms weaken….This is the fate of our generation, this is our life choice, to be prepared and armed, strong and determined, lest the sword be stricken from our fist and our lives cut down….We are a generation of settlers, and, without the steel helmet and the cannon’s fire, we will not be able to plant a tree and build a home.”
Of course, a great leader must always have a sense of history.
During Obama’s first meeting with a Middle East leader, a simple and courageous Arab plan was outlined.
The US has also opposed Israel’s unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem, and – along with every country on the planet – refused to recognize the application of Israeli law to residents of East Jerusalem.
A third imperative for Palestinians is to reunite the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Otherwise, tension looms in the Israeli-American relationship, and calls for one state with equal rights for all will begin to drown out older ideological visions, as settlement activity forecloses the prospect of two states.
At sumud’s core lies the unswerving, blinkered view that Israel is illegitimate and its duration limited.
Indeed, while settlement-building in the West Bank has slackened, it continues.
Furthermore, Netanyahu’s unsentimental assessment of the Middle East does not line up with that of the Obama administration – in thrall to its collapsing romance with moderate Islamists – and its devoted supporters among Jewish Americans.
Netanyahu’s Useless Demand
I believe that some of the preconditions posed by the Israeli prime minister in his recent, widely reported speech are fully justified.
But the other condition demanded by Netanyahu, that the Palestinians recognize the right of the Jewish people to their own state, or the existence of the Jewish nation, is completely arbitrary.
With the advent of peace, we all hope that this bond will become consolidated around a common Israeli citizenship.
Some create strong ties, while others produce weak ties. Think of the difference between friendships and acquaintances.
As leaders increasingly need to understand the relationship of networks to power, they will have to adapt strategies and create teams that benefit from both strong and weak ties.
In some cases, one can orchestrate a complex network simply with carefully specified contracts.
Former President George W. Bush called himself “the decider,” but leadership today is more collaborative and integrative than that implies.
That might sound like a bad thing: Karadžić, who once warned Bosnia’s Muslims that war would lead them down the road to hell, surely deserves to be sentenced for the acts of which he was just acquitted – murder, siege, and slaughter almost beyond naming.
Genocide requires “special intent.”
Genocide makes other crimes seem less important.
It is not more&nbsp;wrong to kill people because of their ethnicity than it is to kill them because of their political beliefs, gender, or for the sheer pleasure of watching them die.
This is the real reason to drop “the crime of crimes”: its redundancy.
New Alliances for a New Century
It is important to note that since 2001, the US has probably done more things, with more nations, in more constructive ways, and in more parts of the world, than at any other time in its history.
The same holds true for China.
New and True Europeans
Cynics may argue that the new member countries could afford to make such concessions because they would end up with hefty EU subsidies anyway.
In contrast, West European states do no longer seem so concerned with the political dimension of European integration.
Although the collapse of the common currency area owing to political squabbles seems unlikely at this point, it cannot be ruled out entirely.
The problem is that both groups of borrowers have been transferring large sums of money to other countries.
Fiscal responsibility in the eurozone would be fatally undermined.
Greece would remain within the eurozone, having lost some of its fiscal and structural sovereignty.
Its member states would accept that monetary union is impossible without fiscal and structural coordination.
Conflicts rage in too many places.
For example, four years ago, when I came to office, only a handful of global leaders knew enough even to talk about climate change – the defining challenge of our times, whose effects we see every day, all around us.
The conventional wisdom will tell you that the MDGs targets – reducing poverty and hunger, improving the health of mothers and children, combating HIV/AIDS, increasing access to education, protecting the environment, and forging a global partnership for development – are simply unattainable.
“Present at the Creation,” he called his memoir.
Amid such uncertainty, our future depends on a UN that brings together the countries of the world not only to talk and debate, but also to agree and to act; that mobilizes civil society, business, philanthropists, and ordinary citizens to help the world’s governments solve current problems; and that delivers peace, development, human rights, and global public goods – in a word, hope – to people around the world every day.
From the point of view of developing countries in need of capital, competing banks probably look like a good thing.
This new model moves beyond the mantra of “public-private partnership.”
The federal government no longer has billions of dollars to dole out to foreign governments, while China is far more centralized and less beholden to its taxpayers.
New Green Drivers of Growth
The very resources that we need to protect will have been substantially depleted by then. Done properly, protecting rain forests is a cost-effective method both to abate climate change and to provide sustainable livelihoods for many millions of people now living in rural poverty.
Equally, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Developemnt has placed energy efficiency center-stage in much of its work on market-led sectoral transformation programs across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The initiatives described here, as well as others discussed in the AGF’s report, offer a major opportunity to reorient the global economy towards resource-saving, low-carbon growth by using limited public resources to stimulate large-scale private investment.
The European Union managed to preserve the essence of its acquis diplomatique.
They also struggled to pursue a united approach to Azerbaijan and Ukraine, and continued to seek a coherent approach to Turkey as accession negotiations remained blocked.
This is a daunting task, given the EU’s current structure.
The world has taken an important step toward controlling climate change by agreeing to the Bali Action Plan at the global negotiations in Indonesia earlier this month.
Second, we must accomplish this while leaving room for continued rapid economic development and poverty reduction.
Such emissions can be eliminated by either shifting to renewable forms of energy or reducing the emissions from fossil fuels.
We must ensure that all countries adopt a verifiable strategy for environmentally sound technology, and that rich countries fulfill the Bali Action Plan’s promise to provide “financial and other incentives” to enable poor countries to adopt the new technologies.
The notion seems like science fiction: everyone knows that AI is not particularly clever.
HIV alone attracts many billions per year.
Neurons operate as a cooperative group: more arrive at the location than are needed for a simple replacement.
As it happens, there is a naturally occurring information structure in which the needed behaviors are easier to observe and explain. That structure can be found in stories.
NEW DELHI – Political transitions in East Asia promise to mark a defining moment in the region’s jittery geopolitics.
But, even if Moon becomes president, the new strains in South Korea’s relationship with Japan, owing to the revival of historical issues, may not be easy to mend.
China’s behavior has fueled a nationalist backlash in Japan, helping to turn hawkish, marginal politicians like Shintaro Ishihara into important mainstream figures.
His wife, Peng Liyuan, is also linked to the military, having served as a civilian member of the army’s musical troupe, and carries an honorary rank of general.
Let me spell out what this means for three policy objectives: building a stronger and safer financial sector, achieving more balanced and more stable growth, and managing large and volatile capital flows.
At the national level, this requires tools to prevent excesses in one sector from bringing down the entire economy.
In the years leading up to the crisis, inequality rose in many countries, with worrisome consequences for social cohesion.
The situation has become quite tense, with talk of “currency wars” and a real risk of financial protectionism.
Let our next failing not be the result of a lack of cooperation.
That is a number roughly the size of six Belgiums, Hungarys, or Swedens.
Impossible? The Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawaris is currently negotiating with the owners of two Greek islands a plan to resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees and put them to work building homes and infrastructure.
Perhaps most important, the majority are linked by family ties to other jihadists.
New Rules for Finance At Last
All are daring and realistic regarding the tasks that await us.
At the Washington Summit last November, the EU suggested a basic principle: all markets, all territories, and all actors putting the global financial system at risk should be monitored.
Indeed, the rating agencies, whose malfunctions contributed to the crisis, must be regulated.
The international financial institutions must support them massively, and also have the resources needed to foresee global unbalances and prevent crises, rather than respond only when events become urgent.
But longer-term secular factors also play a role.
The third option is sterilized intervention.
The argument for this option is that long-term secular factors are important drivers of capital inflows, as advanced-economy investors discover that they are underweight in emerging-market assets and reduce their portfolios’ “home bias.”
They would natu­rally be preoccupied with today’s problems: the eurozone crisis, global recovery, financial regulation, international macroeconomic imbal­ances, and so on.
They need the political buy-in that redistributive taxation, safety nets, and social insurance help generate.
The Basle rules on capital requirements and the World Trade Organization’s rules on subsidies, intellectual property, and investment measures typify this kind of overreaching.
Countries have the right to protect their own regulations and institutions.
Globalization’s rules should not force Americans or Europeans to consume goods that are produced in ways that most citizens in those countries find unacceptable.
7.
The profession’s dissident voices, it seems, are finally reaching a wider audience.
How can firms be understood without examining the corporate contracts that bring together their stakeholders – that is, their shareholders, bankers, suppliers, customers, and employees –&#160;whose complex relationships are manifested in companies’ balance sheets and transaction flows? In concentrating on production and consumption flows, national accounts aggregate or net out such data, thus neglecting the importance of financing and balance-sheet leverage and fragilities.
Meta-economics goes still further, by studying deeper functional aspects of the economy, understood as a complex, interactive, and holistic living system.
Such an approach requires incorporating psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, physics, biology, mathematics, computer science, and other disciplines that study complex adaptive systems.
Policy mistakes ranging from tax hikes to poor central-bank decisions to a global wave of protectionism (most famously America’s Smoot-Hawley tariff) turned a deep recession into the Great Depression.
But China’s trade surplus with the US is not primarily due to undervaluing its currency.  
As recovery continues, this public-sector debt will increasingly crowd out private-sector, local-government and developing-country borrowing.

जिन लोगों में टीबी की शुरूआत हो रही होती है उनके लिए त्वरित नैदानिक परीक्षण सुलभ नहीं होता। कम आय वाले देशों में, निदान की प्रभावी पद्धति बलगम की सूक्ष्मदर्शी यंत्र से जाँच करना है, जो ऐसी पुरानी पड़ चुकी पद्धति है जो सभी संक्रमित रोगियों में से तकरीबन आधे में टीबी का पता लगाने में विफल रहती है, छोटे बच्चों और HIV से संक्रमित रोगियों में तो इसकी सफलता की दर और भी कम है। वास्तव में, बलगम की सूक्ष्मदर्शी यंत्र से जाँच के द्वारा टीबी से ग्रस्त दस में से एक बच्चे से अधिक का निदान नहीं हो पाता।
इसके लिए अनुसंधान की जरूरत है – यह एक ऐसा तथ्य है जिसे डब्ल्यूएचओ की वैश्विक रणनीति स्वीकार करती है। लेकिन टीबी के लिए नैदानिक टूल और उपचारों में निवेश बढ़ाने पर उससे कहीं अधिक खर्च आ रहा है, जितना आबंटित किया गया है। अनुसंधान और विकास के लिए हर वर्ष जरूरी अनुमानित €1.73 बिलियन ($2 बिलियन) में से 2013 में केवल €589 मिलियन का निवेश किया गया।
Investing in the health, education, and skills of children offers the highest economic returns to a country.
Northern European countries generally provide cash support to families to ensure that all children are raised in decent conditions, and they undertake ambitious social programs to provide high-quality day care, pre-school, and primary and secondary education.
There are around 35 births for every 1,000 girls aged 15-19, compared to fewer than ten per thousand in the northern European countries.
In the US, the proportion is much lower, at around 84%.
The UNICEF findings are powerful.
But, by reframing that mission to emphasize support for member governments’ pursuit of inclusive and sustainable growth, the Bank could do even more good.
It has the ability to deploy a variety of financing and risk-sharing instruments in support of both private and public investment.
During the last half-century, America has been a reasonably good steward of international stability – a kind of benign bully operating in the collective interest.
Now a new wave of identity fragmentation, spanning Africa and perhaps Europe, may be approaching.
In Côte d’Ivoire, for example, former President Laurent Gbagbo takes inspiration from Zimbabwe’s autocratic President Robert Mugabe, clinging to power after his clear defeat in the last presidential elections.
But, as the economic crisis persists – and perhaps even worsens – we may witness further explosions of populism and nationalism that could translate into a new wave of fragmentation.
Imperial traditions never fade away completely.
But these earlier reforms were in fact more difficult to undertake than the ones that I launched in the 1980's and 1990's.
Indeed, from my first appearance as General Secretary of the USSR, at the funeral of my predecessor, Constantine Chernyenko, I said that every country should be responsible for its own politics.
As a result, the subsequent spurt of globalization has proceeded with no one steering the wheel - and thus with no means to implement new thinking for a better world.
So, fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world remains more in need of new thinking than ever.
I have proposed a plan that would allow Italy and Spain to refinance their debt by issuing treasury bills at around 1%. I named it in memory of my friend Tomasso Padoa-Schioppa, who, as Italy’s central banker in the 1990’s, helped to stabilize that country’s finances.
This would greatly improve the sustainability of these countries’ debt.
Together, the ECB and the EFSF could do what the ECB cannot do on its own.
New Year’s Hope against Hope
On both sides of the Atlantic, unemployment remained stubbornly high, at around 10%.
Europe and America have the same talented people, the same resources, and the same capital that they had before the recession.
But the country also suffered in the years before the crisis – years of IMF bailouts and austerity –from high unemployment and poverty rates and low and negative growth.
                                    Heroes come, heroes go.
The red of the Revolution, of course, and the black of the oppressed race.
Life in and with this city was as hypnotic as a drug.
In the World Trade Center, human creativity and collaboration were universally codified.
A famous map painted by my friend and compatriot Saul Steinberg depicts the global village as seen from Manhattan: the distance from the Hudson River to the Pacific Ocean is the same as the distance from Ninth to Tenth Avenue on the Upper West Side, and somewhere beyond the calm ocean float Russia, China, and Japan.
In the Bronx or in Soho, in Washington Square or Times Square, in front of the New York Public Library or near a hot dog stand, across all the planets’ races, the banal vies with the exceptional for one’s attention.
Its workforce labors round the clock and its inventiveness, energy, and diversity counter provincialism with scorn. Like America itself, although so utterly different, New York can only be comprehended “synthetically.”
Civilizing the Marketplace of Ideas
A “social science” like economics is supposed to be free of partisan vitriol.
As historians are trained to do, I based my argument on the archives.
Words like “cockroach,” “delusional,” “derp,” “dope,” “fool,” “knave,” “mendacious idiot,” and “zombie” have no place in civilized debate.
But his arguments in this area failed his own “test of truth,” for they lacked “the power…to get…accepted in the competition of the market.”
Appropriately defined triggers thus address one of the main criticisms of international aid.
The Netherlands led the way, slashing its aid to basic education by 36%, outpacing even the 31% cut by crisis-ridden Spain.
What kinds of triggers should be specified for mobilizing buy-down funds? How would it be decided whether these targets had been met?
For many observers, populism is unthinkable without a strong, direct bond between an anti-establishment leader and citizens who feel neglected by mainstream political parties.
Typically, in the populist political imagination, elites disproportionately care for &#160;those who, like themselves, do not really belong. Europe’s elites are regularly accused of lavishing benefits on ethnic minorities in the name of protecting their rights.
Where direct democracy is very much a part of normal politics – in Switzerland, for example – populist parties have been doing better, not worse, than elsewhere.
Nicolas Sarkozy’s French Lessons
Second, and equally important, the extremist vote is weakening.
But this is understandable.
The fifth lesson may be the most serious.
This lesson is so evident that the French Socialist Party now faces a clear choice.
These benefits come in the form of new and better goods and services, as well as efficiency savings for businesses, consumers, and citizens.
Many also permit customers to compare quality ratings, safety data (drawn, for example, from official injury reports), information about the provenance of food, and producers’ environmental and labor practices.
There are also opportunities to prevent lifestyle-related diseases and improve treatment by enabling patients to compare their own data with aggregated data on similar patients.
Consumers, policymakers, and companies must work together, not just to agree on common standards of analysis, but also to set the ground rules for the protection of privacy and property.
But an often-unacknowledged feature of Nigerian politics is that citizens usually back underdogs.
Biafra’s attempted secession in 1967, and the subsequent civil war in which millions died, was triggered by rigged elections, massive official corruption, and the cynical use of ethnicity to achieve political ends.
Indeed, The Economist drew attention recently to the region’s volatility, with militancy on the rise among the young and attacks on civilians and security forces increasingly common.
Analysts had predicted that the election would be marred by violence like that following the presidential poll in 2011, which Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator and candidate of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), lost to the PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan. The mainly Muslim northern part of the country – Buhari’s home base – was convulsed by anarchy and bloodshed as thugs and hooligans took to the streets, attacking Christians and non-northerners, whom they accused of voting for Jonathan.
Recognizing the north’s desperation to win back the presidency, the APC nominated Buhari.
During the campaign, Buhari and other APC leaders put little flesh on their proposed solutions to Nigeria’s many problems. It was enough to remind Nigerians of what had not worked.
Instead, the authorities acted swiftly, isolating patients and monitoring their contacts for 21 days. They screened travelers entering the country and conducted a major public-information campaign to educate citizens on how to contain the epidemic.
Some 50% of the funds would be spent on an expanded, revitalized National Health Insurance Scheme.
Nigeria took on a potentially devastating opponent – the Ebola virus – and won.
यह नाइजीरिया और इस रोग के उन्मूलन के प्रयास में लगे उसके सभी सहयोगियों के लिए एक महान उपलब्धि है। 30 साल से कम समय पहले तक, 125 देश पोलियो से ग्रस्त थे, जिससे हर दिन 1,000 बच्चे लकवाग्रस्त हो जाते थे। अब तक, केवल तीन देश ही ऐसे थे जहाँ वायरस को अभी भी स्थानिक माना जाता है: अफ़गानिस्तान, पाकिस्तान और नाइजीरिया। स्वास्थ्य अधिकारी किसी देश को पोलियो-मुक्त घोषित करने से पहले तीन साल इंतजार करते हैं, लेकिन नाइजीरिया में एक साल की उपलब्धि से इस बात की उम्मीद बलवती हो गई है कि शायद हमने पहले ही इस देश में - और पूरे अफ्रीका में - वाइल्ड पोलियो का अंतिम मामला देख लिया है।

Indeed, the presidential election degenerated into a crude exercise in ballot rigging and voter intimidation.
Moreover, Obasanjo has a long and sorry track record when it comes to elections.
If they unite in their moment of adversity and take their grievance into the streets, they will have to confront the generals, notorious for their disregard of civil rights and liberties.
Nigeria’s Resurgent Oil Diplomacy
But old habits die hard.
In the early 1990’s, desperately short of hard currency, Nigeria negotiated contracts permitting the oil companies to develop new fields and recoup their investment before sharing profits.
Nigeria’s Road to Ruin
At stake is the cohesion of a state that many argue is yet another example of an artificial nation cobbled together by Europeans who did not understand their creation’s social, tribal, and religious forces.
Dokubu then forced Obasanjo into a peace deal.
In addition, religious violence sparked by the Danish cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad ripped through Nigeria in February.
On the contrary, the risks of extended political instability and further large-scale disruptions to Nigeria’s oil output will remain high, at a time when the world can least afford it.
In April 2007, Yar’Adua won a disputed landslide presidential victory.
Corruption investigations launched by Yar’Adua’s government have uncovered broader and deeper problems than many knew existed.
But there are plenty of unanswered questions about his kidney condition and rumors that he may even have Churg-Strauss Syndrome, a life-threatening autoimmune disease.
NEW YORK – On January 10, a particularly atrocious terrorist attack was mounted in a bustling market in the northern Nigerian town of Maiduguri: a ten-year-old girl detonated an explosive device hidden beneath her dress, killing at least 16 people and injuring dozens of others.
Like the LRA, Boko Haram represents a serious threat to regional stability.
This failure to act – not only to prevent further attacks, but also to ensure accountability for past atrocities – is both wrong and dangerous.
Nigeria’s government and the international community must learn the lessons of the LRA and act immediately to save lives and bring perpetrators to justice.
Educational establishments should be designated as safe havens, deserving protection in exactly the same way that the Geneva Conventions protect Red Cross hospitals.
In Pakistan, 132 students were killed in an attack on a school in December.
Some may have already been married off. Some may have been sold.
ABUJA – Nigeria’s legislative elections, to be followed by a presidential poll on April 16, indicate that the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has lost its near-total grip on the country’s politics.
The CPC won the majority of the seats in Katsina, but the PDP still managed to maintain its dominance of that volatile region’s politics.
To President Jonathan’s credit, he delivered clean elections.
The country’s mounting problems – rampant official corruption, decaying social and physical infrastructure, and growing ethnic and religious insurgencies in the northeast, central region, the southeast, and Niger Delta – are yet to be seriously tackled.
Having come to power in the revolt that overthrew the corrupt Shevardnadze, he resorted to the same Soviet-style techniques – intimidating and discrediting opponents, dispersing dissenters by force – to keep his opponents at bay.
In 1999, during the New York celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, I myself heard Shevardnadze assert that Georgia had given the twentieth century two historic figures: “One who erected the Iron Curtain [Joseph Stalin], and one who tore it down” – meaning himself.
Yet there is some good news.
Ogarkov’s ineptness (and inept mendacity), together with the mounting failure since 1979 of the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan, exposed the system’s advanced decrepitude.
Putin’s military build-up and modernization of the past decade was also fueled by energy exports.
Indeed, his partners – particularly the other BRICS countries (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa) – are now unlikely to be able to turn a blind eye to his contempt for international law and for his neighbors’ national sovereignty, as they did during their recent Brazilian summit.
Although his motivation, at least in part, may have been a desire for social justice, Perón was, in effect, bribing the beneficiaries to support his own rise to power and wealth. With his beautiful and outspoken wife – a “woman of the people” – at his side, Perón was able to persuade voters in 1946 that, as President, he would fundamentally change the country.
As with Perón’s presidency, Putin’s began well. The public adored the new strongman as he flexed Russia’s political muscle abroad, punished the “dishonest” Yeltsin-era oligarchs, restricted the “irresponsible” media, and re-centralized power.
Perón’s final years may offer a worrying parallel.
But is this really true?
The Breakthrough Institute recently highlighted on its blog some startling – and important – research findings along these lines, published in August in The Journal of Physics by energy economist Harry Saunders and four colleagues from the US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories.
The real fix to this problem will come when governments focus on research and development aimed at boosting the proportion of green energy sources in overall consumption.
Is all that not a little much for a potential ally? Can working with Assad possibly provide a sound basis for what is supposed to be a common effort?
But this argument is not valid, either. The state has already failed: Assad's regime controls only a fifth of Syria’s territory, and the remaining four-fifths will never willingly resubmit to its terrifying control.
In the aftermath of last week’s peace talks in Vienna – which convened the United States, Russia, Iran, China, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, Jordan, Lebanon, and key European Union members – that question becomes increasingly difficult.
His actions last week brought on the crisis that makes rescue necessary.
Within a few weeks the market forced Paulson’s hand and he had to take them over.
To prevent housing prices from overshooting on the downside, the number of foreclosures has to be kept to a minimum.
Making government funds available should also encourage the private sector to participate in recapitalizing the banking sector and bringing the financial crisis to a close.
While Prokhorov is one of several respected Russian oligarchs, Kudrin was the most respected member of the government.
But members of the US Senate, which must confirm McFaul’s nomination, would do well to ask him about Surkov, a man who has overseen the destruction of Russian democratic politics.
Although he claims that he will not leave politics completely, he now looks like just another oligarch who must choose between capitulation, emigration, and imprisonment. Kudrin’s future is no less obscure.
This is not only common sense, but has been verified by studies and statistical analyses.
It has become even drier in recent decades because of a decline in rainfall, which is probably the result, at least in part, of man-made climate change, caused mostly by energy use in rich countries.
Both people and livestock need assured water supplies.
Living standards could be improved significantly and rapidly through low-cost targeted investments in malaria control, school feeding programs, rainwater harvesting for drinking water, mobile health clinics, and boreholes for livestock and irrigation in appropriate locations.
On the Test for Severe Impairment, where scores can range from zero to 24, three-quarters of these patients scored zero.
So, for the past three months, Golubchuk has had a tube down his throat to help him breathe and another in his stomach to feed him.
If Golubchuk’s children can convince the court that their father is not suffering, the court might reasonably order the hospital to grant them custody of their father.
I suppose that censors never have much of a sense of humor, and that irony and parody are usually beyond their intellectual grasp.
They didn’t have to like Israel, provided that they weren’t too rude about America’s pro-Israel bias and its refusal to accept that insisting on Israel’s inalienable right to exist was not the same as allowing Israel to do whatever it wanted.
The European Union, for example, has been light on assisting the development of the rule of law, good policing, and representative institutions in the Arab world, despite a development and political compact with its governments.
How worried should businesses, investors, and policymakers around the world be about the end of near-zero interest rates and the start of the first monetary-tightening cycle since 2004-2008?
And even assuming that interest rates reach 1-1.5% by the end of 2016, they will still be very low by historic standards, both in absolute terms and relative to inflation.
First, the divergence of monetary policies between the US and other major economies is already universally understood and expected.
Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, and two cases do not constitute a statistically significant sample.
Fortunately, the United States’ foreign-policy elite finally seems ready to do something to protect Syria’s people.
And, in July alone, almost 50,000 migrants entered the European Union through Greece.
Third, the nuclear deal with Iran, despite facing continued scrutiny in Iran and the US, has raised hopes that the country could play an important role in pushing for a political solution in Syria.
After all, the only time he has been prepared to strike any kind of deal over the last four years was when he believed that the US was prepared to intervene militarily in response to his use of chemical weapons.
We now know that they are not.
The best-known tools for this are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements.
That is, an increase in the willingness to lend tends to increase the value of the collateral, and also improves the borrowers’ performance, thereby encouraging a relaxation of credit criteria.
Banks must pay for their implicit government guarantee by using less leverage and accepting restrictions on how they invest depositors’ money.
Shorting bonds by purchasing a CDS contract carries limited risk but almost unlimited profit potential, whereas selling a CDS contract offers limited profits but practically unlimited risks.
In contrast to the United States and Europe, where the growth outlook looked weak at best, emerging markets were expected to sustain their strong performance from the decade preceding the global financial crisis, and thus become the engine of the global economy.
Except for a handful of small countries that benefited from natural-resource bonanzas, all of the successful economies of the last six decades owe their growth to rapid industrialization.
The country has developed remarkable strengths in IT services, such as software and call centers.
As a result, the capacity of manufacturing to absorb labor has become much more limited.
Manufacturing industries will remain poor countries’ “escalator industries,” but the escalator will neither move as rapidly, nor go as high.
During the round-the-clock coverage of the nuclear drama, the specter of Chernobyl has been raised repeatedly.
We see coal as a polluting but reasonably “safe” energy source compared to nuclear energy.
Moreover, given that the plants are already paid for, waste facilities are already in place, and the high decommissioning cost will have to be paid regardless of timing, the actual operating costs are very low – half or lower per kilowatt-hour than the cost of the cheapest fossil fuels.
And, since the onset of the crisis, the G-20 countries – with France (and the United States) as driving forces – have been pressing for better regulation, governance, and accountability.
But recovering the billions of dollars stolen by corrupt leaders and officials in the developing world has so far proved to be a lengthy process.
In the developing world, $20 billion could finance 48,000 kilometers of two-lane paved roads, or provide treatment for 120 million people with HIV/AIDS for a full year.
Civil society should agitate for action and accountability.
At Citigroup, a majority of shareholders rejected managers’ pay at Citigroup – the first S&amp;P 500 company at which that happened.
In 1989, the Chinese Government sent troops to repress the country’s pro-democracy movement.
Let’s hope that Business Roundtable et al. v. SEC does not mean the same thing for shareholder democracy.
In a related effort to get its residents to know each other, the city government also facilitates street parties.
It wants those who live in the community after the present generation has gone to have the same opportunities for a good quality of life as today’s residents have.
Although later research has cast doubt on the existence of such dramatic differences, there is little doubt that being in a good mood makes people feel better about themselves and more likely to help others.
In America, for example, more than one in six workers who would like a full-time job can’t find one.
When demands for China to adjust its exchange rate began during George W. Bush’s administration, its multilateral trade surplus was small.
This is the real trade distortion in the global economy – one in which millions of poor people in developing countries are hurt as America helps some of the world’s richest farmers.
Imposing unilateral duties after unilaterally labeling China a “currency manipulator” would undermine the multilateral system, with little payoff.
This decline seems to have stopped, and the most recent data indicate that the bottom may have been reached.
The IMF, the World Bank, and other international financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as the European Central Bank and the European Commission, have worked together to stabilize the situation.
That is why it has become so difficult for small and medium-sized companies to get new loans or to refinance existing loans.
This will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Some strident voices are even dismissing climate change as a hoax on a par with the Y2K computer bug.
Indeed, the Panel has more often been criticized for being far too conservative in its projections of, for example, the likely sea-level rise in the twenty-first century.
The fact is that the world would have to make a transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient future even if there were no climate change.
Anxiety levels may have come down, in board rooms and stock markets, but the daily drama for survival continues.  Indeed, for many people it has deepened, in the villages and streets of the world’s least-developed countries – particularly in Africa.
There are some encouraging signs.
This calls for a broadening of the IMF’s surveillance mandate beyond macroeconomic and monetary policies so that it can deal with wider financial and regulatory issues.  It means establishing a very high-level political council to take strategic decisions critical to global stability.  And it also requires reforming the voting system to ensure decisions command the support of the majority of members.
G-20 leaders need again to manage difficult domestic pressures, overcome narrow agendas and resist populist temptations – and prove the sceptics wrong.
Cities, then, represent the most important development challenge of all.
But the agreement fails to specify who will undertake what costs.
Will we, then, manage to sign a legal and binding agreement in Cancún? Will we be able to implement cooperation mechanisms between countries such as the UN’s Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries – the REDD program – so as to prevent deforestation and encourage technology transfer and financing?
They continue to assume that we live in an era of Western domination of world history.
Hence, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has squandered a valuable opportunity to send out a message of hope to the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims, one that would have rid the world of the grand global illusion that peacemaking is a “white man’s burden.”
With a thin majority in the lower house and a narrow plurality in the upper house (which has adopted a censure resolution against Noda), the DPJ on its own is unable to pass fiscal and other legislation essential to running a government.
As a result, the public is paying increasing attention to the newly created Japan Restoration Party (JRP) and its populist leader, Osaka City Mayor Toru Hashimoto, a former governor of Osaka prefecture and the son of a minor Yakuza (mafioso).
In fact, the system’s resilience in absorbing huge disruptions – the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 earthquake – is one key reason for its survival.
Can the industry’s new champions, Apple and Google – not to mention titans in other tech sectors – avoid Nokia’s fate?
But Elop was not the only person at fault.
Why didn’t Nokia choose Android earlier? The short answer is money.
But there are steps they can take to prolong their success.
Herein lies the most important lesson in Nokia’s fall.
But, with China’s military build-up causing nervousness everywhere, and with North Korea a perpetual source of insecurity, many governments in the region are starting to work with outside powers.
Yet Indonesia is also trying to align itself with Asia’s rising power, China, by seeking greater defense and security cooperation.
Both India and China are each seeking greater influence over the strategically important country of Myanmar.
But now Japan’s political and economic influence in South East Asia is gradually declining, owing in part to its failure to exert influence over security and defense matters.
After the recent landmine blasts, by contrast, President Park Geun-hye would not back down from her demands that the North, which denied planting the mines, apologize.
Will Kim respond to that isolation recklessly, by continuing to antagonize the South, or pragmatically, by becoming more flexible?
Today’s young soldiers represent the so-called Jangmadang (“black market”) generation that came of age under the marketization process that followed the massive famine in the mid-1990s.
The accords represented an effort to improve East-West relations during the Cold War, and included an emphasis on human rights.
Indeed, none of the region’s key strategic players – China, the United States, and South Korea – seem to be adequately prepared for such a scenario.
A similar discussion needs to take place in the US.
With a trillion-dollar economy, world-class technology, a 500,000-strong military, and a vibrant, well-educated society, the country is capable of planning, manning, and paying for the aftermath of a peaceful end to the Kim regime.
Given the instability in North Korea, each country should define its role now.
What Kim does seem to have received is South Korea’s agreement to stop the broadcasts, which included some very telling personal criticism of him.
China has essentially washed its hands of its small neighbor.
Many South Koreans are not sure they are prepared to accept the responsibility of absorbing the North’s population.
Historical turning points are normally easier to identify in retrospect.
North Korea’s leaders have a history of aggressiveness, a demonstrated contempt for their people, and a record of selling just about anything (from drugs and counterfeit dollars to missile parts) to earn hard currency.
Initial reactions to North Korea’s nuclear test were uniformly critical, culminating (thus far) in UN Security Council Resolution 1718, which condemns the test, demands that North Korea resume full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and imposes a range of military, political, and economic sanctions.
The problem is that it would almost surely trigger a massive, costly war, and it would not necessarily succeed in destroying all of North Korea’s hidden capabilities.
North Korea’s Nuclear Shadow
Against this background, Fowle’s release, which apparently carried no quid pro quo, has been interpreted as a sign of the regime’s readiness to initiate a long-awaited dialogue with the United States.
After years of frustration, North Korea began to&nbsp;implement in 2007 what amounted to a “grand bargain.”
As General Curtis Scaparrotti, the top US military commander in South Korea, recently warned, North Korea may already have access, through Iran and Pakistan, to the expertise needed to miniaturize a nuclear device and mount it on a missile.
A dialogue with the deaf can be difficult; but a dialogue with an amnesiac can be no dialogue at all.
The gap, instead, reflects recent historical choices.
As such, North Korea’s economic recovery is vital for an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula.
But this expansion has not brought fundamental change to the two Koreas’ relationship.
As of today, the Six-Party Talks is the principal framework to open up the future of the North.
North Korea’s Powerful Weakness
In certain bargaining situations, weakness and the threat of collapse can be a source of power. To take a well-known example, if you owe a bank $1,000, the bank has power over you; but if you owe the bank $1 billion, you may have considerable bargaining power over the bank.
The signs of a change are intriguing.
SEOUL – Once again, tension is rising across Asia over North Korea’s missile program.
Indeed, the Bush administration’s unilateral behavior, including the dismantling of the 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework with North Korea, the hyping of an enriched uranium deal, and the infamous “axis of evil” speech, have all increased the paranoia of an already paranoid regime.
During the same period, there have been 10 South Korean presidents and 11 US presidents.
Strategic Clarity on North Korea
But rarely does a country pursue all of them, as North Korea evidently is.
For China, mending relations with its Southeast Asian neighbors, which have been damaged by territorial disputes, is a higher priority.
Giving one another access to deep thinking on the issue could be the best means to encourage cooperation and, most important, a doctrine of “no surprises.”
The Dear Sister Disappears
He removed leaders who could potentially oppose her, including such senior figures as Lee Yong-chul and Lee Je-gang.
But no one should mistake this for a Pyongyang Spring. Indeed, the regime’s efforts to hide, yet again, a severe food shortage demonstrate that its core values have not changed in the least.
By filing its claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, Denmark has joined our era’s “great game”: the contest for economic control over a large part of the Arctic.
Under the terms of the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration, all of the countries bordering the Arctic Ocean agree to resolve their claims peacefully and based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
And, in addition to the vast distances, there is the harsh climate.
Earlier this year, I visited the center for a fascinating exhibition on the first independent Norwegian constitution promulgated in 1814.
One of the writers of the constitution, Frederik Motzfeldt, argued that Jews would never assimilate themselves with the people of any country.
Now, too, the Enlightenment is often invoked as shorthand for the Western values that are supposedly in danger of “Islamization.”
But they are not yet in the majority, and the belief that the West is in imminent danger of being “Arabized” or “Islamized” is not quite yet mainstream.
BOGOTA, LIMA, SANTIAGO – International economic coordination is as necessary as it is elusive.
These economies face two serious problems.
To be sure, the re-commoditization of Latin America has causes that go beyond China’s exchange-rate policies.
To reduce their dependence on commodities they also have signed free-trade agreements with the US (inexplicably not approved by the US Congress in the case of Colombia).
Indeed, oil prices have been falling, not rising.
More important, Russia has not cut off natural-gas supplies to Western Europe, which would be a major shock for gas-dependent EU economies.
Markets tend to disregard the risks of events whose probability is hard to assess but that have a major impact on confidence when they do occur.
The interaction of any of these global factors with a variety of regional and local sources of geopolitical tension could be dangerously combustible.
If your debt becomes unsustainable because you borrowed too much to take long vacations or buy expensive appliances, your bad behavior is to blame.
Because a formal bankruptcy regime for governments does not exist (though Anne Krueger, the International Monetary Fund’s then-deputy managing director, proposed one more than a decade ago), countries have had to rely on a market-based approach to resolve excessive debt problems.
Second, if the holdouts are paid in full, the majority of creditors who accepted a haircut can request to be paid in full, too.
These forces loathe the alphabet soup of supra-national governance institutions – the EU, the UN, the WTO, and the IMF, among others – that globalization requires.
Worse, the eurozone may again be at risk: some countries (the United Kingdom) may exit the EU; others (the UK, Spain, and Belgium) eventually may break up.
Meanwhile, the Middle East remains a region mired in backwardness.
That ambition is not difficult to discern.
Indeed, now Armenia and Kyrgyzstan are in play.
In particular, the tension with Europe and the United States over Ukraine will shift Russia’s energy and raw-material exports – and the related pipelines – toward Asia and China.
Unfortunately, the sanctions that the US and Europe are imposing on Russia, though necessary, may merely reinforce the conviction among Putin and his nationalist Slavophile advisers that Russia’s future lies not in the West, but in a separate integration project in the East.
Near-zero policy rates encourage “carry trades” – debt-financed investment in higher-yielding risky assets such as longer-term government and private bonds, equities, commodities and currencies of countries with high interest rates.
According to Stein, only monetary policy (higher policy interest rates) “gets in all of the cracks” of the financial system and prevents asset bubbles.
Some risks now have a lower probability – even if they are not fully extinguished.
Thanks to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes” speech, new financial facilities to stabilize distressed sovereign debtors, and the beginning of a banking union, the eurozone is no longer on the verge of collapse.
For starters, there is the risk of a hard landing in China.
Fourth, the crises in some fragile emerging markets may worsen.
Investors may be right that these risks will not materialize in their more severe form, or that loose monetary policies in advanced economies and continued recovery will contain such risks.
In most advanced economies, bubbles are being inflated by very low short- and long-term interest rates.
They complain bitterly about regulators’ “interference” with the free market, property rights, and the sacrosanct ideal of home ownership.
But the higher home prices rise, the further they will fall – and the greater the collateral economic and financial damage will be – when the bubble deflates.
One push is for governments to provide for their people; the other calls for governments to stop restricting their people’s freedom, particularly their economic liberty. The first type of reform will likely only exacerbate the Arab world’s grave problems; the second offers hope for positive and sustainable change.
Such jobs are a liability for society, not an asset.
State handouts can be reliably financed only by controlling the economy’s productive sectors.  But in the Arab world, as everywhere else, this leads to theft, corruption, uncompetitive monopolies, a stifling of enterprise, and, eventually and inevitably, to decline and decay.
The 64th opening of the General Assembly asks us to rise to an exceptional moment.
To be sure, the issues are complex and difficult, especially those of financing adaptation and mitigation efforts in poorer countries.
The world is united on a third front, as well.
Yet listening to the world’s leaders speak, last week, I was struck by their passion, commitment, and collective determination to turn a page from a past of countries divided by narrow interests to nations united in the cause of a global common good.
The government convinced the Turkish Cypriots to make a leap of faith and vote in favor of the Annan plan in order to reunite the island.
No one – not the US, the EU, Turkey, Greece, or the two Cypriot communities – can afford to waste it.
Should the talks fail, the side that behaves in an uncompromising manner will bear full responsibility for dividing the island forever.
If it does not, the EU should take America to court.
But what is alleged to have happened was not a case of the US reciprocally countering supposed illegal activities by other states.
There is no other force holding it together.
Surveillance technology has advanced a great deal since 1961, when the Convention was concluded.
The world barely stirred.
But its credibility now hangs by a thread.
The nuclear-armed states will not sign on any time soon to any treaty that bans the use of their weapons under all circumstances.
That was a tragic missed opportunity, for a US-Soviet agreement, reached in what was still an essentially binary international system, might have had truly global meaning.
Unless conditions in the region change dramatically for the better, the creation of a WMD-free zone (WMDFZ) in the Middle East – an idea launched at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2010 – might prove a stillborn initiative.
Indeed, Israel’s concept of “peace first and denuclearization last” was vindicated in the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty, which speaks of a WMDFZ as a goal “to be achieved in the context of a comprehensive, lasting and stable peace.”
Likewise, for all the effort put into improving America’s most important bilateral relationships – those with China and Russia – ties with both countries have become increasingly tense, owing most recently to the Kremlin’s intransigence over Syria and official Chinese behavior in the South China Sea.
Negotiations to “de-alert” the 2,000 nuclear weapons that remain at absurdly dangerous, Cold War-era launch readiness have never really started.
And it is not naïve to believe that non-proliferation and disarmament are inextricably connected: that so long as any state retains nuclear weapons, others will want them.
But the Scientists’ argument was sobering, and demands attention.
At the end of March, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak will host a follow-up meeting to Obama’s successful Nuclear Security Summit in 2010, which brought together 47 government leaders to agree on a comprehensive program aimed at securing all such materials within four years.
Third, sustaining high-level policy attention to the entire nuclear agenda requires an institutional setting.
The recent framework agreement on Iran’s nuclear program has had the opposite effect.
Iran’s leaders can thank George W. Bush.
Turkey is also engaging in strategic recalculations.
It is Iran’s geopolitical behavior, not its threshold nuclear status, that matters.
But the challenge does not end with reducing emissions.
Scientists have spent the last 60 years trying to figure out the best way to create these conditions.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility in California is getting impressive results by firing high-powered lasers at capsules of fuel, crushing the particles together to trigger fusion reactions.
Machines all over the world are reaching fusion temperatures and extending our technological capabilities.
Kecelakaan nuklir ini merupakan kejadian terburuk sejak krisis reaktor Chernobyl pada tahun 1986.
Sebagai permulaan, pemerintah dan industri harus memperlakukan keamanan nuklir sebagai proses perbaikan yang berkelanjutan dan bekerja untuk mengimbangi dengan ancaman dan tantangan yang ada.
Pengawasan yang efektif dapat menghilangkan perasaan mudah puas.
Penting sekali bagi kita untuk belajar dari Fukushima dan terapkan pembelajaran tersebut ke dalam strategi kita untuk memberantas terorisme nuklir.
In the last five-year review conference at the United Nations in 2005, only Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea were not participating – the first three have nuclear arsenals that are advanced, and the fourth’s is embryonic.
Having received at least tentative approval from the US for its policy, India still faces two further obstacles: an acceptable agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a 45-nation body that – until now – has barred nuclear trade with any nation that refuses to accept international nuclear standards.
Since World War II, strikes to halt nuclear activities have taken place exclusively in the Middle East: Iraq was struck by Iran (1980), Israel (1981), and the United States (1991, 2003), while Iraq bombed Iran (1984-87) and Israel (1991). But raids never generated significant radiological consequences, because plants were under construction, contained inconsequential amounts of nuclear material, had radioactive elements removed prior to the attack, or because the attacker missed the mark.
Authorities have distributed potassium iodide tablets to the nearby towns of Yerham, Dimona, and Aruar.
At that time, history provided odd support.
It could claim that closure demonstrates its commitment to reducing regional nuclear tensions, while sending a message about the wisdom of building reactors in the world’s most volatile region.
One fact is not in doubt: the NPT is the legal linchpin for the nuclear nonproliferation regime now signed and ratified by all but three nations – India, Pakistan, and Israel – and one drop-out, North Korea.
And then there is Iran.
Hence, the Soviet Union, the US, Egypt, and India decided that it is better to live with a nuclear-armed China, North Korea, Israel, and Pakistan, respectively, than risk war.
They do so with good reason.
We should be wary about defining nuclear security so narrowly.
Given the existence of a technologically advanced verification regime that can detect even small underground nuclear tests – what US Secretary of State John Kerry recently called “one of the great accomplishments of the modern world” – this is especially disappointing.
The nations of Asia have a particular affection for him, owing to the years he spent as a child in Indonesia.
But the future of security in the Pacific should not be left to US decision-makers alone.
According to Obama, “few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change.”
Pleas for action on climate change reflect fears that global warming might undermine agricultural production, especially in the developing world.
Sea levels are rising, but they have been rising at least since the early 1800’s.
Finally, it is simply wrong to say that storms are growing stronger every hurricane season.
If there is one bilateral relationship that the Bush administration is seen to have handled successfully, it is that with India.
America’s mistakes include the Patriot Act, the invasion of Iraq, the mishandling of Afghanistan, the torture committed at Abu Ghraib, and the prison at Guantánamo Bay.
A new vision of the US-India relationship would focus on global warming, the collapse of industrial agriculture, the widening gap between rich and poor, the conventional and nuclear arms race in Asia, and the intensification of ethnic and religious conflict.
Over the past three decades, five American presidents have struggled to figure out what to do about Iran.
The process could include appointing a US envoy to Iran.
Such an approach will require that each side exercise broad restraint and live with the ambiguity of working with a strong adversary to manage profound differences.
At their core lie Iran and its nuclear program.
America is fighting three wars in this region: in Iraq and Afghanistan, and – not to be forgotten! – the “war on terror” against Al Qaeda and its offshoots, a war that is closely linked to the interests and conflicts within this large region.
As for the Middle East conflict, the conflicting interests of Binyamin Netanyahu’s administration and the American government are becoming clear.
It is hard to believe that Netanyahu, of all Israeli prime ministers, would be the one to accept idly Iran’s entry into the nuclear club.
That is an unfamiliar position for a new US president.
But, unlike then, the countries that are accumulating the capital today are not spending it on consumption – remember the endless pictures of Saudi princes buying up real estate on the French Riviera – but on investment, infrastructure, and education.
Obama at Halftime
A combination of financial-sector recapitalization and rapid expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet prevented a complete credit lockup.
But it was responsible for allowing flawed expectations of a sharp recovery to pre-crisis levels of output and consumption to persist.
And, if successful over time, it might have made the rest of Obama’s agenda seem less overwhelming and more affordable.
The economic and political implications of this long-term trend have been widely discussed but left largely unattended, betraying the general lack of concern for distributional issues that shadows elites’ excessive faith in markets to provide beneficial outcomes.
But, more important, reality changed – in several ways.
The Republicans’ most ingenious trick was to use procedural measures to keep bills from being brought to a vote in the Senate, so that the public would ultimately blame “the stalemate in Washington” on Obama.
In his astonishingly swift rise, he was virtually alone – a Democrat, but not a creature of the Democratic Party, a politician of progressive instincts, but not an ideologue.
That, together with her avowed combativeness, has impaired coherent policymaking on critical issues like the Syrian crisis.
With a seemingly out-of-control John McCain taking over as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the situation is likely to become even more complicated.
When his staff presented carefully researched reasons for not joining the euro, many Europeans sneered.
And, in May 2010, the IMF endorsed the European authorities’ decision not to impose losses on Greece’s private creditors – a move that was reversed only after unprecedented fiscal belt-tightening sent the Greek economy into a tailspin.
If Obama’s words are to count, he must continue to push for the kind of deal Greece needs – one that errs on the side of too much debt forgiveness, rather than too little.
Locked in a war that has already cost nearly $1 trillion, the US has now shifted its focus to making peace with the enemy. It will not work.
Yet Obama has refused to designate the Taliban as a terrorist organization, leaving it off the list of terrorist networks mentioned, for example, in his recent joint statement with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Instead, his administration has sought to portray the Taliban as a moderate force that can be accommodated within Afghanistan’s political system.
And, fearing desertions to the Islamic State, it knows that giving Obama what he wants – a peace deal that enables him to declare victory before his term ends in January 2017 – would be its death knell.
And the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation of 2010 could have done much more to curtail large banks' power and limit the damage they can cause.
Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a pro-reform group, recently summed up the current situation well: “[A]dvisers can recommend investments that generate lucrative commissions for them, even though their clients get stuck with high fees, subpar performance, and unacceptably risky products."
(Warren joined Obama in unveiling the proposal to protect retirement savers.)
And, judging by the high number of distinguished and honorable professionals in the industry, many advisers, if not most, already do.
In Iran, then-President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate, offered what might have been a reasonable deal to curb the country’s nuclear program. But Bush and his team preferred to pressure Iran with sanctions and military threats, and any hope for a negotiated solution vanished when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad succeeded Khatami in 2005.
The Bush administration changed the regime in Iraq, but at a monumental cost that is still being paid. In contrast, Obama’s goal concerning Iran was modest and focused on denuclearization.
But it is also not the hermit state of the 1950s, having moved significantly toward a market economy in recent years. Indeed, by the early 2000s, more than four-fifths of an average North Korean’s household income comprised unofficial earnings from market activities.
Obama rejected his predecessor George W. Bush’s policy of isolating “rogue states,” recognizing that America’s only hope for influencing isolated countries’ behavior was to engage directly with them in a bilateral context.
The resumption of diplomatic relations with Myanmar was a critical feature of the Obama administration’s “rebalancing” toward Asia.
While the deal will stand or fall on the extent to which it pulls Iran back from the nuclear brink, it can also open the door to further bilateral negotiations on matters of common interest, from ending the war in Syria to cracking down on drug-running in Afghanistan.
But ensuring that the US can continue to lead in the twenty-first century will require a different kind of engagement.
Or else what, exactly? To be sure, the US government has coddled too many brutal dictators over the last half-century.
Unfortunately, this type of pressure could not work in China when its people demanded what other Asians had won.
So far, anti-American rhetoric has been remarkably muted in the uprisings sweeping the Middle East.
Building institutions that guarantee not only political liberties, but also the protection of minorities, as well as other liberal conditions, is difficult enough in countries where such institutions had once existed, as in post-communist Central Europe.
Obama seems to understand this.
Even the country’s proverbial inequality is beginning to shrink, albeit slowly, and lower-middle-class living standards are finally rising to where they should have been a decade ago.
Ever since, a country that had never truly experienced democratic rule has enjoyed all the charms and vicissitudes of competitive elections, legislative battles, and rotation in power.
Moreover, relations with the US, while important, are no longer paramount.
Obama will say all the right things during his visit, and will be cheered everywhere.
In his first official trip to Africa, US President Barack Obama is striking back in a novel way.
Like his predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Obama wants to avoid messy entanglements in Africa’s internal politics.
Ethnic relations in this highly diverse nation are as good as they are anywhere in the world.
In 1957, when legal segregation seemed entrenched in the US, Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, used the occasion of his country’s independence from Britain to highlight the injustices experienced daily by black Americans.
NEW YORK – It is hard for international observers of the United States to grasp the political paralysis that grips the country, and that seriously threatens America’s ability to solve its domestic problems and contribute to international problem solving.
On all of these questions, a middle ground of independents (neither Democrats nor Republicans) was more evenly divided.
Finally, policy paralysis around the US federal budget may be playing the biggest role of all in America’s incipient governance crisis. The US public is rabidly opposed to paying higher taxes, yet the trend level of taxation (at around 18% of national income) is not sufficient to pay for the core functions of government.
These paralyzing factors could intensify in the years ahead.
CAMBRIDGE – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vigorous foreign policy in the seven months since he took office has surprised observers. After inviting the leaders of Pakistan and other neighboring countries to his inauguration, he embarked on trips to China, Australia, and the United States.
Terrorism includes not just physical violence, but also assaults in cyberspace.
By contrast, the Modi government plans to pursue a pro-growth agenda that includes reducing bureaucratic delays, increasing infrastructure investment, stimulating manufacturing activity, and shifting to a simpler unified tax system.
Successful reform will be an important step in preventing the decline of American power.
Demographers portray a country in 2050 in which non-Hispanic whites will be only a slim majority.
Today, the US is the world’s third most populous country; 50 years from now it is still likely to be third (after only China and India).
Likewise, because the presence of many cultures creates avenues of connection with other countries, it helps to broaden Americans’ attitudes and views of the world in an era of globalization.
Moments like these are especially challenging for foreign policymakers, who must keep one eye on the world as it is and the other on the world as it might be in the future.
This is one of those times.
Third, there is at least one motivation behind the Arab revolts that permeates Western politics as well: the urge to forget the facts, the risks, and the future, and just throw the rascals out.
A dictator who has shown no concern for his people might actually prove quite talented at clinging to power.
We all now hope that President-elect Obama will provide the answers, not only in words, but also in actions.
Indeed, for the past seven years America’s foreign policy seems to have been conducted entirely through the prism of the “war on terror” and the Iraq war.
MILAN – The world’s developed economies, of which the United States is by far the largest and systemically most important, face a range of difficult political and social choices.
But this approach establishes a self-limiting pattern, because balance sheets are damaged, demand falters, and expectations have to be adjusted downward.
Obviously, it is impossible to reconcile all of these objectives.
The desire to avoid substantial tax increases (and to sustain consumption levels) will almost surely be reflected in a continuing shortfall of public-sector investment, in turn undermining long-term growth.&#160;
Obama’s China Card?
Moreover, the US is increasing its troop presence in the Pacific at a time when it already has more military force in the region than all other countries combined.
The US, like Australia, denies that all of this adds up to a policy of containment aimed at China.
None of this is meant to suggest that the Pacific region does not need America.
But more and more Australians are beginning to question the closeness and wisdom of our strategic ties to the US.
On the positive side of the ledger, Obama received ceremonial treatment not normally accorded to visiting foreign leaders, even other visiting US presidents, demonstrating the importance China’s government attached to the visit.
First, Obama did not openly criticize the Chinese government’s notorious human rights record, nor did he use his influence to persuade China to release any prisoner of conscience, as his US predecessors always did when visiting the country.
Moreover, what he did achieve looks superficial, while what he gave up seems substantial.
But talk is always cheaper than action.
The OECD, however, cautions governments not to consolidate too rapidly in a slow global recovery.
Moreover, the goal of balancing the primary budget in 2015 is hardly encouraging.
Let’s hope that the late conversion to tough deficit rhetoric gets a lot of play.
Abbas’ presidential term has expired, and elections are constantly being postponed.
The paradox here is double.
As he admitted in a recent interview with the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds, if pressured to concede on sacred Palestinian principles such as refugees, Jerusalem, and borders, he “would pack his suitcase and go away.”
Whatever route is taken, the great question today concerns the enigma that is Bibi Netanyahu, a would-be Churchill who believes that his mission is to thwart the designs of Iran’s evil new Shia empire, something which requires the goodwill of the international community, particularly of the Obama administration.
This is the chance of a lifetime to break through the cynicism that has pervaded American politics for decades.
Indeed, it is now.
Last year, he pledged to double US foreign aid by 2012, raising it to $50 billion a year.  (That still leaves the US lagging behind many European nations in the percentage of its national income that it gives in aid.)
This may be the greatest ethical challenge of the Obama presidency, but, because so much hangs on it, the way in which he responds to it is likely to play a decisive role in how his presidency will be judged.
He recognizes that the current political climate is not conducive to successful peace negotiations.
Furthermore, Obama’s embrace of Israel during his visit has undermined America’s role as an honest broker in future negotiations – and no credible candidate has surfaced to fill the position.
(Such low-hanging fruit has been increasingly scarce for the Republican Party, which is beleaguered by the perception that it has been hijacked by its most extreme elements.)
Strikingly energetic and self-confident, Obama has set out on a titanic journey to remake America’s economy and redress a broken and dysfunctional international system.
But Obama might soon realize that most of his predecessors started as believers in international cooperation, until events forced them to fall back on a strategy of confrontation.
Nor was North Korea impressed by Obama’s warnings that America might shoot down its rocket if they went ahead with their launch in defiance of the United Nations.
Nor would old enemies and competitors like Russia and China readily abandon the benefits of spoiling American plans.
This is the case in Lebanon with Hezbollah, in Palestine with Hamas, in Iraq with Moqtada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army and scores of other groups, with the Taliban and tribal warlords in Afghanistan, and with breakaway movements in Pakistan that have been emboldened by Pervez Musharaf’s resignation.
In the Middle East, Obama faces an almost impossible task of redressing historical and political ills.
Unlike the insoluble mess that he inherits in the broader Middle East, the road to a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli dispute has already been paved, and no wheels would have to be reinvented.
These are all products of a deliberate policy.
While Europeans chew on that, they should also reflect on what the Cairo speech could mean for their own position in the Middle East.
In September, both at the United Nations and at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, many countries agreed to work on Obama’s nuclear agenda.
The Obama administration is also consulting with Congress on when to re-submit the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was rejected by the Senate 10 years ago.
In addition, North Korea violated its treaty obligations and exploded two crude devices.
Otherwise, reductions that create anxieties in other countries could lead them to develop their own weapons and thus increase the number of nuclear weapons states.
In general, Obama has pursued a policy of nuclear balance in which steps towards disarmament are accompanied by measures to retain America’s nuclear primacy.
In describing the New START Treaty, Obama administration officials stress the magnitude of the reductions.

Even with the lower ceilings found in the New START Treaty, the US will maintain thousands of nuclear weapons, as well as the long-standing US “strategic triad” of intercontinental land-based and submarine-launched ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.

The idea that Obama lacks a plan is right in a sense: nothing he has proposed has been big enough to boost the US economy’s painfully slow recovery from the 2007-9 recession, nor to insulate it from shocks coming from Europe and from weakening growth in the rest of the world.
That is why Obama could appoint the highly talented but politically unpopular Summers, the former president of Harvard University.
Sperling is just not very visible to the public.
Obama’s Democratic defenders counter that his policies staved off a second Great Depression, and that the US economy has been steadily working its way out of a deep hole ever since.
The maximum rate of economic contraction – a veritable freefall – came in the last quarter of 2008.
Given that difficulty, the right way to assess whether the fiscal stimulus enacted in January 2009 had a positive impact is to start with common sense.
Allowing for a wide range of uncertainty, the CBO estimates that the stimulus added 1.5-3.5% to GDP by the fourth quarter, relative to where it otherwise would have been.
Balancing hard-power relations with governments with soft-power support for democracy is like walking a tightrope.
Historically, rising states used smart-power strategies to good avail.
In 2007, President Hu Jintao proclaimed the importance of investing in China’s soft power.
Smart power is an important strategy for success in world politics, but no one said that it would be easy.
Why did President Lyndon Johnson’s administration steer the US into a war that looked like a lost cause even to its own officials? One possible explanation is that Johnson was thoroughly frightened by America’s right wing.
Indeed, the military has in effect militarized the arguments of the peace movement of the 1960’s.
So the politics of the Vietnam dilemma has been handed down to Obama virtually intact.
Had Obama become caught in the military’s somber spell? Or was his presence a silent public vow, as he makes his decisions, to keep his mind fixed on matters of life and death, rather than on the next election?
He has fallen desperately short in making real progress towards the Promised Land, in which America lives in peace with the Muslim world, thanks to an Israeli-Palestinian settlement; brings about a nuclear-free planet (a noble, yet entirely delusional pledge); gets Russia’s support in addressing other global problems; contains China’s quest to translate its growing economic power into major strategic gains; ends its two diversionary wars in Muslim countries; and leads a solid international alliance to cut short Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
After all, it was a Republican who produced the Reagan Plan, calling on Israel to withdraw to the 1967 borders.
Glory in foreign policy is no guarantee of future electoral gains.
Rather than stemming further erosion of the national commitment to educate the next generation, Obama has shifted his focus to the long-term goal of balancing the budget – even while the macroeconomic storm is still raging.
Moreover, Obama has joined George W. Bush in claiming executive powers that rival those claimed by Charles II of Britain in the seventeenth century.
Obama versus Romney on Jobs
Ultimately, Obama, bolstered by polls endorsing his plan, won partial passage of two AJA policies: a one-third cut in employees’ payroll taxes (he had proposed one-half), and an extension of unemployment benefits by about 60% of what he had recommended.
Altogether, Congress left at least one million jobs on the negotiating table, holding unemployed workers hostage to the outcome of November’s election.
Nor is Romney’s promise to enact immediate cuts in federal discretionary spending by an additional 5% likely to boost job growth, as he asserts.
न्यूयार्क – राष्ट्रपति बराक ओबामा का सिग्नेचर 2010 स्वास्थ्य-देखभाल सुधार, यूएस रोगी संरक्षण और किफ़ायती देखभाल अधिनियम (पेशेंट प्रोटेक्शन एंड अफ़ोर्डेबल केयर एक्ट), उन लाखों अमेरिकियों के लिए बीमा कवरेज का विस्तार करने में सफल रहा है जिन्हें यह अन्यथा उपलब्ध न हो पाता। और, आलोचकों की चेतावनियों के विपरीत, इससे स्वास्थ्य-देखभाल की लागतें बढ़ी नहीं हैं; वास्तव में, इस बात की कुछ आशा है कि लागत की वक्र रेखा अंततः नीचे की ओर झुक सकती है।
लेकिन, अमेरिका के फ़ार्मास्यूटिकल उद्योग की दृष्टि से TRIPS ने बहुत ज़्यादा काम नहीं किया। इस प्रकार, अमेरिका के साथ अपने व्यापार संबंध बढ़ाने की भारत सरकार की इच्छा इस उद्योग को, भारत को पेटेंट प्राप्त करना आसान बनाकर और कम-लागत वाली सामान्य दवाओं की उपलब्धता कम करने के लिए मजबूर करके वहाँ से काम आगे बढ़ाने का आदर्श अवसर देती है, जहाँ पर TRIPS ने इसे छोड़ दिया था।
चूँकि पेटेंट अनिवार्य रूप से सरकार द्वारा दिए जाने वाले एकाधिकार हैं, इसलिए वे उन्हीं अक्षमताओं और किराया वसूली के तरीके की ओर ले जाते हैं जैसा कि ऐसे किसी अन्य बाज़ार विरूपण में होता है। जो पेटेंट किसी दवा के मूल्य को सौ-गुना बढ़ा देता है, उसका बाज़ार पर 10,000% टैरिफ़ जितना असर होता है। ऐसे मामलों में, दवा कंपनियों को डॉक्टरों और जनता को अपने उत्पादों की सुरक्षा और प्रभावशीलता के बारे में गुमराह करने, और यहाँ तक कि अपनी दवाओं के अनुचित इस्तेमाल को बढ़ावा देने के लिए भारी प्रोत्साहन मिल जाता है, जिसके लिए वे अकसर डॉक्टरों को उन दवाइयों का नुस्ख़ा लिखने के लिए राजी करने के लिए नवाचारी प्रलोभनकारी भुगतान की विधि का इस्तेमाल करते हैं।
And yet, there is something odd about the European mania for a black American politician, even as we all know that a black president or prime minister (let alone one whose middle name is Hussein) is still unthinkable in Europe.
Still, the illusion was nice while it lasted, and Obamamania may contain an element of nostalgia, as well as hope.
But the real Europeans loved him for it.
Yet such projections could never entirely disguise a nagging anxiety.
That is why they are going crazy over Barack Obama’s election.
But, having said all that, the stimulus package gave the economy a necessary shot in the arm.
While it will presumably lack the public option many of us prefer, this is still a real achievement.
Medium-term fiscal reform, for its part, will be pushed by bond-market vigilantes.
The need then will be for more spending on education and training – the only thing that in the long run will make American workers more productive and reduce income inequality.
Government and commercial activities virtually ground to halt this spring as democracy activists, in alliance with politicians and lawmakers opposed to a third term, battled Obasanjo’s allies to thwart the proposed bill.
American, British, and French oil companies enjoyed a virtual monopoly of Nigeria’s oil industry.
But this has not stopped Abubakar, a formidable political operator, from launching his presidential bid, despite uncertainty over whether he will fight it out with his boss for control of the PDP machinery or decamp to another political party.
In his “State of the Union” address in February, US President Barack Obama proposed a “comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership” with Europe based on trade that is “fair and free.”
This is not the case for the EU and the US.
In the US, the disruption took the form of yet another fiscal mini-drama.
Such a global structure has the potential to encourage better medium-term alignments to reduce trade barriers, set proper standards, and enhance mutually beneficial cooperation.
Talks among state officials, the Obama administration, and the banks are currently focused on reported abuses in servicing mortgages, foreclosing on homes, and evicting their residents.
Banks want neither millions of negotiations nor, most importantly, the need to face the losses implied on their loan portfolio.
Start with the proposal made by Martin Feldstein, who recommends a trade: the government should reduce the value of mortgages when they are sufficiently underwater, with the government and the banks splitting the losses; in exchange, the borrower must agree that the new loan becomes “full recourse.”
And when the downside risks materialized, the losses were largely socialized – the primary reason why US public debt has soared in recent years.
NEW YORK – Samudera dan atmosfir terhubung dalam cara yang baru sedikit kita pahami.
Para ilmuwan yang mempelajari perubahan iklim sudah menunjukkan cara mengatasi permasalahan ini dengan menerapkan arahan yang jelas serta target pencapaian yang progresif.

Of Banks and Bailouts
The complexity of securitized pools of loans that were sold worldwide – bilaterally over the counter – as pieces of various tranches, meant that nobody was certain about who owned what or what it was worth.
Estimates of the losses on US loans and securities range from under $1 trillion to almost $4 trillion.
In addition to bailouts and toxic asset plans, governments worldwide want central banks to monitor macroeconomic and overall financial-sector risk (as opposed to focusing on individual firms).
Converting some portion of debt to equity under predetermined solvency-threatening conditions would provide an extra layer of protection.
Assuming complete success for the UK’s scheme, offshore wind power could produce more than 10% of the country’s electricity in 2020 and reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 22Mt, or 5%, per year. But the cost would also be phenomenal.
Finally, green-economy advocates promise a surfeit of green jobs. But economic research convincingly shows that while subsidies can buy extra jobs, they eventually have to be financed with increased taxes, costing an equal number of jobs elsewhere.
In recent weeks, ever since Kenya’s government announced that oil had been discovered in the Lake Turkana basin, more jokes have emerged.
The Turkana people are, as the joke suggests, as far away from Nairobi as one can be without being foreigners.
We have discovered oil!”
If Kenya approaches oil exploration and extraction in Turkana the way my Facebook friends have, and fails to implement these common-sense recommendations, a few years from now Kenyans might be sorry that oil was ever found.
The administration’s multi-pronged effort to postpone pain to US consumers, including super easy monetary and fiscal policy, only risks a greater crisis in the not-too-distant future. It is not at all hard to imagine the whole strategy boomeranging in early 2009, soon after the next US president takes office.
Secretary Paulson has emphasized that the US is “open for business” from sovereign wealth funds.
Even with the prevalence of dollar indexation across the region, exchange-rate appreciation would still help promote cheaper imports and higher living standards.
WASHINGTON, DC – The recent decline in oil prices is likely to have a major, largely positive impact on the global economy – even greater than most observers seem to recognize.
Saudi Arabia correctly reasoned that cutting output would not boost prices, but simply concede space for new players to step in and grab market share.
But advising countries simply to lower subsidies is often meaningless.
With the correct approach, today’s oil-price volatility could turn out to be a critical turning point on the path toward a more sustainable future, characterized by shared prosperity and genuine progress on poverty reduction.
आइए अब इतिहास पर नज़र डालें - विशेष रूप से, 1974 के बाद से ओपेक का पहली बार उद्भव होने पर मुद्रास्फीति-समायोजित तेल की कीमतों के इतिहास पर। इस इतिहास से कीमत निर्धारण की दो अलग-अलग व्यवस्थाओं का पता चलता है। 1974 से 1985 तक, अमेरिका के बेंचमार्क तेल की कीमत में आज के मूल्य की दृष्टि से $50 और $120 के बीच घट-बढ़ होती रही। 1986 से 2004 तक, इसमें $20 से $50 के बीच, आज के मूल्य की दृष्टि से $50 और $120 के बीच घट-बढ़ होती रही (1990 में कुवैत के आक्रमण और 1998 में  हुए रूसी अवमूल्यन के बाद थोड़े समय के लिए इस घट-बढ़ का स्वरूप कुछ हटकर रहा)। अंत में, 2005 से 2014 तक, तेल का कारोबार फिर से लगभग $50 से $120 की 1974-1985 की सीमा में होना शुरू हो गया, 2008-09 के वित्तीय संकट की अवधि के दौरान दो बहुत ही कम अवधि में हुए परिवर्तन इसके अपवाद हैं।

If the price remains at this level, it will have important implications – some good, some bad – for many countries around the world.
Lower demand reflects both the current weakness of economic activity, particularly in Europe and China, and, more important, the longer-term changes in technology, which will increase cars’ fuel efficiency and induce the use of solar power and other non-oil energy sources.
Unless expectations about the fundamentals of future supply and demand change, the rise in the interest rate will cause oil prices to fall further.
A further decline in the price of oil could have major geopolitical repercussions.
The bad news is that low prices will place even greater strains on the main oil-exporting countries.
Anticipation of post-sanctions Iranian oil production has also affected markets.
The muted effect of oil prices on global growth should not have come as a complete surprise.
Countries with floating exchange rates, including Colombia, Mexico, and Russia, have managed to adjust so far, despite facing significantly tighter fiscal constraints (though Russia’s situation remains especially vulnerable if low oil prices endure).
In fact, the secret to OPEC’s survival is its weakness, not its strength.
Higher prices fuel higher growth in these countries, which, accompanied by a population boom, leads to higher domestic energy consumption.
The rhetoric of energy independence in the oil-consuming countries makes the situation even worse: the oil-producing countries are building energy-intensive industries to guarantee a market for their oil once consuming nations wean themselves of imported oil.
This enables continued economic growth with high oil prices.

All else being equal, per capita incomes and productivity in countries with high proportions of elderly people tend to grow more slowly than in younger countries.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s demographic prospects look particularly bleak, as mushrooming populations of young people move into labor markets that cannot accommodate them.
In many EU countries, a much higher percentage of men than women are in the labor force.
If EU countries are to overcome the demographic challenges of the next half-century, they should not delay in preparing for them.
Like Chávez in Venezuela, Kirchner in Argentina, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and López Obrador in Mexico, President García belongs to the unreconstructed left that springs from the great Latin American populist tradition.
Indeed, domestic royalties on Bolivian gas production are being increased by more than 50%, and the price charged to Bolivia’s foreign clients may well be doubled.
Trading Away Human Rights
Indeed, the TPP’s emphasis on regulatory policies suggests that business interests will trump human rights.
In fact, a human-rights impact assessment would not be difficult to conduct: guiding principles presented to the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2011 explain how to do it.
The average North American meal now travels 2,400 kilometers (1,491 miles) from field to plate.
Unlike the top-down, technical solutions that policymakers have usually favored, a solution based on the concept of food as an entitlement, not a privilege, would involve – and empower – multiple actors.
In this sense, the social audits used by India’s Right to Food Campaign to assess compliance with court-mandated policies, such as the delivery of school meals, will be essential in the coming years.
Breakthrough crops, fertilizer subsidies, and aid campaigns may grab the headlines, but it is the right-to-food movement that holds the greatest promise for ending hunger.
China, 37 (38); 3.
By 2008, after London was awarded the 2012 Games, the total was £245 million, and stood at £264 million this year.
As for the others, the formula for success is fairly simple: select your potentially winning sports, pick the potential medalists in those sports, pour money into them, and stick with both the sports and the players until the medals roll in.
But it does lead to the second question: Can the methods that produce Olympic winners be applied elsewhere?
NEW YORK – China lobbied long and hard to host this summer’s Olympics, and thousands of Chinese literally danced in the streets when the decision was made to award Beijing the games.
It ignores what the country has accomplished, and it risks consequences that are inconsistent with what the critics themselves want to see.
There are also indications that China’s foreign policy is evolving.
Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting more efficient energy use, taking action on climate change, and maintaining an open global economy – these and other tasks require Chinese participation, even cooperation, if globalization is not to overwhelm us all.
All of which brings us back to this summer’s events in Beijing.
The London games confirmed this trend. The Sino-American duopoly has loomed large in the medal count (22% of the total), but not outrageously so.
Clearly, Indian society has a complex relationship with sports.
But traditions can also be created.
While sports like running are relatively inexpensive, others – including gymnastics, swimming, and even more so team games and equestrian events – require significant resources.
That may sound like a resounding success: the mere announcement of the OMT scheme was enough to end the monetary union’s existential crisis. But, according to the German Constitutional Court, the policy violates European Union treaties – a ruling that the European Court of Justice is now reviewing.
Without central-bank involvement, investors’ panicky prophecy would be self-fulfilling, with the resulting spike in borrowing costs making it impossible for the government to repay its creditors. In other words, prohibiting the central bank from acting as lender of last resort can push solvent economies into a needless debt crisis, undermining output and employment.
The past two and a half years have been a disaster for peace, stability, and our sense of common humanity.
While it has allowed US President Barack Obama to back down from his threat of military intervention in response to the regime’s use of chemical weapons, it has also allowed Assad to continue to butcher his people.
Saudi Arabia is doing what it can to help.
Taking their cue from the sacred Rome Treaty’s reference to “ever closer union,” the European Commission’s theologians view every crisis as an opportunity to advance their federalist agenda.
First, the identity of the single European banking supervisor remains undecided, and the ECB has seen an opportunity for a power grab.
The second unresolved question is how to achieve a banking union in legal terms.
And Euroskeptic British politicians see this as an opportunity to recast the UK’s relationship with the EU; indeed, for some, it means a chance to negotiate an exit.
These losses then translate into reduced demand for American or German machine tools.
Moreover, if the stimulus succeeds and leads to an early recovery, the additional income gained may more than offset the increase in debt.
We should also remember that what growth there is in the world economy in 2009-2010 will come mostly from developing economies.
Moreover, fairness and security considerations demand that the most vulnerable, who had no role in the making of this crisis, receive support.
Tangible progress is needed in global trade negotiations in order to signal that the world economy will remain open.
The reaction by China’s public to the gory photos of the injured was furious.
Then, last August, during the Asian Cup soccer tournament, Chinese fans in Chongqing, Jinan, and Beijing hurled insults at the Japanese team – and bottles at their team bus.
The complexity and depth of these anti-Japanese sentiments helps sustain them and sets them apart from other, more fleeting and contradictory anti-foreign sentiments, such as those Chinese sometimes harbor towards Americans.
Recent developments suggest that a purely cooperative bilateral relationship is unlikely, to say the least.
He did eventually come to understand the nature and severity of the crisis, and then took decisive steps that contributed to halting the economic freefall.
Though Bernanke may be the best in his peer group, the fact is that the economic crisis decisively proved him and his peers to have been wrong.
Any dispassionate assessment of the Fed’s thinking before and well into the crisis shows that it failed to understand the economics of its own bailiwick, banking and financial markets.
Never before in the post-World War II era have American consumers been so weak for so long.
The 14-quarter growth trend from early 2008 to mid-2011 was cut from 0.5% to 0.2%; the bulk of the downward revision was concentrated in the first six quarters of this period – for which the estimate of the annualized consumption decline was doubled, from 1.1% to 2.2%.
And, while the personal saving rate rose to 5% of disposable income in the first half of 2011 from the rock-bottom 1.2% low hit in mid-2005, this is far short of the nearly 8% norm that prevailed during the last 30 years of the twentieth century.
Needless to say, such an outcome would spell serious trouble for America’s already-contentious deficit-and-debt debate.
One World, One Europe
Of course, this was not to be.
But, for national leaders in the EU whose last ambition is to have to deal with a new Jacques Delors, i.e., a man with ideas of his own, a cipher like Barroso is just the man for the job.
If Europeans were to set for themselves the goal of speaking with one voice, of having one representative in the spectrum of multilateral institutions – starting with the UN Security Council – they would be taken more seriously.
The online marketplaces built by Amazon and Alibaba, for example, have reshaped the retail landscape, partly by changing the local nature of retail markets.
And those who are employed are often stuck in roles that do not take full advantage of their skills.
In short, while online talent platforms cannot boost weak demand in advanced economies, solve complex development issues in the emerging world, or create better jobs across the board, they can have a major impact on seemingly intractable issues like unemployment, underemployment, and low job satisfaction.
In fact, the most sought-after engineers and software developers may not need to apply for jobs at all; companies are now increasingly recruiting “passive” candidates, sometimes forcing employers to increase the salaries of workers they want to retain.
TOKYO – The risk of global currency and trade wars is rising, with most economies now engaged in competitive devaluations.
Aside from the eurozone, the US, Japan, and the United Kingdom all need a weaker currency.
This intervention upset the EU, as it has put upward pressure on the euro at a time when the European Central Bank has placed interest rates on hold while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the US Federal Reserve are easing monetary policy further.
The BoJ and the BoE are following suit, putting even more pressure on the eurozone, where a stubborn ECB would rather kill any chance of recovery for the PIIGS than do more QE, ostensibly owing to fears of a rise in inflation.
The online world, after all, has provided enormous opportunities to billions of denizens, largely because it has never been governed.
Doing this will require the key players responsible for the Internet’s openness to enter into a mix of voluntary and binding agreements that establish something akin to the rule of law.
Governments would not seek to create backdoors to access data if doing so would make the Internet less secure.
Without this action, announced on December 15, 1978, US-China relations could not have moved beyond a small, high-level connection with a limited agenda.
From a political point of view, there was the famed Taiwan lobby, one of the most powerful in the US, still dominated by the conservative wing of American politics.&
They wanted trade and other benefits of recognition, which would benefit both nations in those Cold War days, when China was fiercely hostile to the Soviet Union, with which it had almost gone to war only a few years earlier.
He believed China could leapfrog the lost years in which the world had passed it by, but only with American support.
In the late 1980's, it was fashionable in some Japanese policy circles to argue that the Pax Americana was over, to be replaced in Asia by Pax Japonica. America's economy seemed to be tanking, Japan's was soaring, and projections favored 2005 as the date when it would overtake the United States.
The closed nature of Japanese society and the dearth of ideas are partly attributable to the linguistic barrier.
Indeed, relations with China are Japan's most profound problem.
Many young Japanese - often the brightest and most entrepreneurial - demand to live in an open society, but the option they are choosing now is emigration.
Russia and China were among them.
The middle class is being hollowed out, and failed overseas adventures have discouraged the once “indispensable nation” from bearing the burden of global leadership.
The ruble is falling like a stone. It will be a tough winter in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Unfortunately, rather than leveling the playing field, the battle of ideas may skew US politics even further in favor of big business.
Even if researchers themselves are motivated by only the noblest of goals, their need for funding forces them to take into account profitability.
Fifteen years later, Jensen wrote a paper about the costs of excessive sensitivity of pay to performance.
A pro-business agenda aims at maximizing the profits of existing firms; a pro-market agenda, by contrast, seeks to encourage the best business conditions for everyone.
At the same time, Osama bin Laden released two audio statements condemning Western and Israeli attacks on Muslims and reiterating the need for violent warfare to liberate occupied Muslim territories from the infidels.
I see the army of the Cross in our land,

The term for those who have not joined Al Qaeda’s jihad is the “sitters” or the “immobile ones” ( qaaidun ).
If there is any surprise about bin Laden’s hideout, it is its location in a military town, Abbottabad, in the shadow of an army academy.
Pakistan’s homegrown Islamist militias continue to operate openly, and the Pakistani army and intelligence remain loath to sever their cozy ties with extremist and terrorist elements.
It is the self-styled secular generals who have reared the forces of jihad and fathered the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jalaluddin Haqqani militia, and other groups.
He promised that by 2015 the deficit would stand at only £37 billion, or 2.1% of GDP – equivalent to balancing current&nbsp;spending and revenue. Instead, the deficit for 2014-2015 is expected to be £97 billion.
People start behaving as though the books were balanced, ignoring the fact that they are not. When one believes the narrative, one acts in ways that make it come true.
Yes, the British economy has finally started to grow; and, yes, growth is expected to continue. But is there any reason to believe that the recovery will not be undermined by another five years of austerity, leading Osborne (or his successor) to postpone the deadline once again?
Of all the things she was forced to leave behind in Syria, her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose – not if she were ever going to realize her dream of being a doctor and avoid a future dictated by deprivation, violence, and loss.
The good news is that there is a growing global consensus on the centrality of schooling in breaking intergenerational cycles of inequality and building stronger, more stable societies.
Children with disabilities – most of whom never enter school in developing countries – see their already-minimal prospects decline even further in times of crisis.
Though many details remain to be discussed, the idea is gaining strength.
If these girls can show so much bravery in seeking an education, surely the international community can do more to make sure they succeed in obtaining one.
Put simply, we cannot achieve our vision of a prosperous, healthy, and peaceful world – the one that the SDGs aim to advance – without education.
Against this backdrop, participants at the Oslo Summit will be discussing how to generate the momentum and political will to broaden and deepen the donor base, and assess the highest-impact use of these funds.



In the last few months, enthusiasm about these countries’ post-2008 economic resilience and growth potential has given way to bleak forecasts, with economists like Ricardo Hausmann declaring that “the emerging-market party” is coming to an end.
At the same time, rapidly growing middle classes across the developing world would constitute a new source of demand.
Moreover, nothing was done in anticipation of the end of terms-of-trade gains in resource-rich countries like Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have been facing rising wage costs and supply-capacity limits.
FRANKFURT – Many in the eurozone’s crisis countries complain that the source of their suffering is a rigid economic-austerity regime – including reductions in wages and pensions, tax increases, and soaring unemployment – imposed on them by Germany.
Such support can already be found via the various rescue mechanisms – above all, the European Stability Mechanism and the implicit guarantees of TARGET 2 – that have been erected since the crisis began.
And yet when the bailout is presented the other way around, with German taxpayers asked to backstop reckless Italian or Spanish banks, somehow it is supposed to be an act of solidarity. Legacy problems in national banking systems should be solved at the national level before the banking union moves forward.
Those who violate the rules consistently, and even announce that they will continue in their misbehavior, should not be allowed to blackmail the community and should ultimately consider leaving the club.
The following decade turned out to be one of, first, the war on terror and, later, the worst financial and economic crisis in almost a century – a time when virtually every developed economy experienced a long and deep recession.
So, not only is public debt set to increase much faster than nominal GDP growth, but governments will have to devote an increasing share of their revenues to interest payments.
Little wonder, then, that the Commission has issued a warning that crisis-related fiscal expansion and the aging population raise questions about the sustainability of public finances in the EU.
The NICE era is well and truly over.
In 2008, we started at 365% – and this calculation leaves out the pervasive use of derivatives, which was absent in the 1930’s.
Others – including me – failed to anticipate the extent of the rebound.
The globalization of financial markets that took place since the 1980’s allowed financial capital to move freely around the world, making it difficult to tax or regulate.
But governments are primarily concerned with their own economies.
How, then, can the rest of the world?
Nobody knows how much oil is left and how much it will cost to extract, but the peak of global oil production will probably be reached sometime in the next quarter century, perhaps even in the next few years.
The long history of climate change shows the risks of dramatic and abrupt changes over the course of but a few decades;
First, we should recognize that even as oil becomes scarce, other fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and unconventional sources such as shale and tar sands, will remain plentiful for centuries.
Reality will catch up with us.
Today, however, the US “empire” is in relative decline and fiscally over-stretched.
Global climate-change negotiations have similarly ended in failure, and disagreement reigns concerning how to address food and energy security amid a new scramble for global resources.
Finally, rising powers like China, India, and Brazil are far too focused on managing the next stage of their domestic development to bear the financial and political costs that come with new international responsibilities.
Indeed, Santorum’s view of the Netherlands as a kind of progressive dystopia has a slightly old-fashioned ring to it nowadays.

Editors, as well as reporters, at least tried to get the facts right.
There is no need to be exposed to different opinions, which are, in any case, considered to be propaganda.
Everything is political. That is the only truth that counts.
LONDON – The United Nations climate change conference, to be held in Copenhagen this December, should provide the climax to two years of international negotiations over a new global treaty aimed at addressing the causes and consequences of greenhouse-gas emissions.
Current greenhouse-gas levels are largely due to industrialization in the developed world since the nineteenth century.
Most developed countries are targeting reductions in annual emissions of at least 80% – relative to levels in 1990 – by 2050.
There is no real alternative. High-carbon growth is doomed, crippled by high prices for fossil fuels and killed off by the hostile physical environment that climate change will create.
It starts with an idea and requires a wide range of skills to bring that idea to fruition: synthesis or extraction of more or less complicated molecules, proof of their therapeutic effect in cell cultures and animals, testing for toxicity, and clinical studies.
There is therefore the risk that new drugs may in fact be worse than products already on the market.
As a result, certain drugs are used much more frequently than would be expected from their approved indications.
The challenge is how to produce new drugs that – because patients are too few or too poor – promise very limited returns.
When the heads of the EU’s member states met in Brussels to deal with the Greek crisis, the interbank market, which is decisive for the liquidity of financial institutions, had started to freeze, just like after the collapse of Lehmann Brothers in September 2008.
Leaders talk about “systemic risks” and the necessity of bailouts, but at the same time let those responsible for two consecutive systemic failures maintain the same global casino that twice brought the world near collapse.
Indeed, there are good reasons for believing that the Tea Party movement in the United States, connected as it is with the economic disaster that followed Lehman’s collapse, is one of the channels of the energy released by the crisis.
As a result of drought and heat, more than 500 wildfires have raged out of control, smothering Moscow in smoke and threatening several nuclear facilities.
But, viewed in a broader context, and using the logic of physics, important parts of the plot can be understood.
But the biggest change in Earth’s energy budget by far over the past hundred years is due to the accumulation in our atmosphere of greenhouse gases, which limit the exit of heat into space.
The problem is that a reduction in those extremes to which we are already well-adapted provides only modest benefits, whereas the new extremes to which we are not adapted can be devastating, as recent events in Pakistan show.
Clinging to the hope that it is all chance, and all natural, seems naive.
Germany is reunited and much of the Third World is growing faster than the First World, with computer software built in Bangalore and American graduate programs, including business schools, receiving thousands of application from smart Chinese students.
Indeed, the situation is even more absurd when G7 finance ministers meet: the central bank governors of France, Germany, and Italy still attend these meetings, even though their banks have been reduced to local branches of the European Central Bank, while the president of the ECB - these countries' real monetary authority - is a mere "invited guest."
The Europeans don't even seem to care very much about the job.
Obsolete dreams of grandeur should not be allowed to interfere with a realistic and fair distribution of power in the international arena.
To be fair, McCain never suggested that US troops will wage 100 years of war, as some of his critics claim.
Iraq’s government is demanding a withdrawal timetable from the US, not because it believes that Iraqi forces will be ready to take over soon, but to burnish its nationalist credentials ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections.
When these missions are accomplished – but not sooner – US forces should withdraw from Iraq.
A faster pace for rates hikes could have offset the slow start, but the ECB again erred on the side of caution.
Several frustrated hawks on the Governing Council are dead set against cutting interest rates precisely because they believe that, at 4%, rates already have been “cut” from the 5% or so levels they had expected to achieve.
Being out of step also focuses attention on the fact that the ECB is in danger of losing control over inflationary expectations. The US Federal Reserve can cut 100 basis points from the federal funds rate and not lose control over US inflationary expectations.
Conventional policy advice urges innovative monetary interventions bearing an ever expanding array of acronyms, even as governments are admonished to spend on “obvious” needs such as infrastructure.
The economists Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon, on the other hand, argue that the problem is on the supply side.
In 2008, these elevated debt levels – in banks, businesses, households, and governments – sparked the financial crisis.
To be sure, the world’s economic outlook could still take a turn for the better.
Suddenly Americans - long champions of globalization - seem concerned about its adverse effects on their economy.
At the very least, this shows that markets by themselves do not quickly work to ensure that there is a job for everyone who wishes to work.
If America's highly trained engineers and computer specialists are unable to withstand the onslaught of outsourcing, what about those who are even less trained? Yes, America may be able to maintain a competitive advantage at the very top , the breakthrough research, the invention of the next laser.
This has, indeed, already happened in some developed countries: in the ten years that have passed since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, average real wages in the US have actually declined.
The Africans speak English, type at least 50 words a minute on a computer, take data from paper claim forms supplied by US health insurers via satellite in electronic form, put it into new digital forms, and ship them back to the US.
"There are real opportunities for outsourcing to Africa," he says, "but there are barriers, too."
The spread of mobile telephony has revolutionized ordinary life in a continent with the world's lowest penetration of fixed-line telephones.
The odds that Africa one day will receive a fair share of outsourcing jobs are improving.
Northern hostility, separatism, and racism toward the southerners are at the center of this split.
When al-Qaeda decided to take on the United States, it targeted the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than 260 people.
But African leaders have no interest in a real African Union.
At least they paid some attention to the mounting scientific evidence.     And certain principles set out in the 1992 Rio Framework Convention, including “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,” were affirmed.
European firms will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage relative to American firms, which bear no cost for their emissions.
Perhaps it is time to try another approach: a commitment by each country to raise the price of emissions (whether through a carbon tax or emissions caps) to an agreed level, say, $80 per ton.
Given the fundamental problems underlying it, Copenhagen’s failure should not be a surprise.
As these countries posted current-account deficits, northern European countries accumulated current-account surpluses, exposing a widening competitiveness gap.
While the decline in aggregate demand led to reduced imports, the combination of higher interest rates, lower public expenditure, tax increases, and wage deflation boosted unemployment and triggered recession.
But Van Rompuy’s minimal proposal may be insufficient.
And, by 3 p.m., the house must be ready for Sally’s graduation party.
In 2013, Sam’s day would have been far more difficult, stressful, and expensive.
Indeed, with certain institutions and industries benefiting when all of the system’s components – vehicles, roads, fuel stations, traffic laws, regulations, vehicle standards, and licensed drivers – work together, no transformational development has occurred in road transportation since Karl Benz invented the car and Henry Ford popularized it.
For Americans earning minimum wage ($7.25 per hour), time spent driving at a rate of 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour costs $0.24 per mile.
Owning Up to Israel’s Bomb
What is remarkable is that it has lasted so long.”
Here, a change in Iran’s pattern of behavior toward Israel is an absolute prerequisite.
By abandoning ambiguity and taking its own bomb out of the “basement,” Israel might be able to affirm its capacity for nuclear deterrence more convincingly, and, more importantly, enhance a serious debate about the urgency of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.
Altogether, during 2000-2008, the top executive teams at Bear Stearns and Lehman cashed out about $1.1 billion and $850 million (in 2009 dollars), respectively.
It is important for financial firms – and firms in general – to reform compensation structures to ensure tighter alignment between executive payoffs and long-term results.
The first time was after the passage in 1994 of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), when the flow of finance to Mexico to build factories to export to the largest consumer market in the world was overwhelmed by the flow of capital headed to the United States in search of a friendlier investment climate.
Armed with that insight, the disease of the business cycle should be addressed in one or more of three ways.
But that, too, is not the situation today in the core economies of the North Atlantic.
Right now, the global economy is suffering a grand mal seizure of slack demand and high unemployment.
What Musharraf and his associates did not anticipate was that a large number of vanquished Taliban and their Al Qaeda supporters would slip into Pakistan. Among those who did was Osama bin Laden.
Worse still has been the impact on Pakistan’s ethnic make-up.
So, should Pakistan have refused to participate in the war on terror? No matter how it had reacted to the US request for help in eliminating the threat posed to its security by Al Qaeda and the Taliban, this fight would have arrived in Pakistan.
Both Musharraf and his supporters in Washington hoped that mainstream parties’ participation in the election would end Pakistan’s governance crisis and provide popular support for a decisive confrontation with the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
Musharraf, who regularly claims to act on the basis of a “Pakistan first” policy, must now let go of partisan objectives and form a national unity government led by a prime minister from the opposition.
Finally, it must begin a dialogue with Musharraf and the military on a permanent, constitutional separation of powers.
NEW DELHI – As US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bluntly told Pakistan in 2011 that “you can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.”
And, despite the increasing blowback from state-aided militancy, the generals remain too wedded to sponsoring terrorist groups that are under United Nations sanctions – including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and the Haqqani network – to reverse course.
Earlier this month, Pakistani authorities aided a large public rally by Saeed in Lahore, including by running special trains to ferry in participants, so that the architect of the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack (among many others) could project himself as some sort of messiah of the Pakistani people.
As long as the military, intelligence, and nuclear establishments remain unaccountable to the civilian government, Pakistan, the region, and the world will continue to be at risk from the jihadist snake pit that the country has become.
According to senior Pakistani officials – including Sartaj Aziz, a key adviser on foreign affairs and national security – there was no agreement in the works when the stories appeared.
To be sure, the US government’s agenda would have some benefits for Pakistan.
Developed after the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament, the doctrine calls for Indian troops to move rapidly to occupy 300-500 square kilometers of Pakistani territory in the event of another terrorist attack. The occupation would end only when Pakistan formally relinquished its claim to Kashmir and dismantled all terrorist training camps operating within its borders.
Pakistan on the Precipice
But, having deftly out-maneuvered his opponents for three years, Zardari seems to have misread the current political environment, for Pakistan is not the same country in which his wife and father-in-law wielded power.
The Bush administration, eager to have a democratically elected government in Pakistan to continue the fight against terrorism, was believed to have brokered the agreement.
LAHORE – July was one of the roughest months in Pakistan’s history.
The ISI seemed to be keeping its lines of communications open to some Taliban in the hope that they could be used as a reserve force in case of another military confrontation with India or a precipitous American withdrawal from Afghanistan.
After hesitating, Zardari arrived in London three days later.
But will Pakistan’s military once more inject itself directly into the political arena, as it has done four times in the six decades since independence? Or will the country’s civilian leaders mend their ways?
Once the Shah left, the radical minority that was willing to fight and die for its cause devoured the “moderate majority,” establishing Islamist rule in short order.
Few Iranians had ever heard of Ayatollah Khomeini until 1978, but it didn’t take long for his message to electrify millions.
The desire to exact revenge on Musharraf for stifling democracy and failing to provide Bhutto with sufficient security will only inflame a political atmosphere that Pakistani liberals seek to de-radicalize.
But the costs are too high to be impulsive, and the storms of political Islam are difficult to forecast.
It was attended by then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and government ministers from several countries.
In the 1960’s, America wanted Pakistan to be on its side as it sought to contain the spread of communism in Asia.
That came to a sudden stop in 1949, as a result of the first of many trade wars that the two countries have fought.
Today’s democratic government has taken a step in this direction by amending Pakistan’s constitution.
Today, however, Pakistan’s military may not be prepared to act with the force and conviction it showed last time.
“Our institutions are working and democracy is functional,” Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told members of the Western press.
Officials are also aware that a change in the cabinet will be seen as mere window dressing unless people are shown that the government has a plan to rescue the economy from collapse and alleviate the burdens faced by ordinary people.
The campaign’s immediate impact consists in Pakistan’s determination to establish its authority in the area.
Moreover, violent militancy has now spread into Pakistan proper.
But thousands of fighters are thought to be dispersed in the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan, with many of them focused on operations in Afghanistan.
In Afghanistan today, they have an opportunity to reject that precedent and act on their mutual interest in stability.
Unless the West acts quickly, Bin Laden’s death is likely to result in a major realignment of world politics, driven in part by Pakistan’s shift from America’s strategic orbit to that of China.
In the meantime, Pakistan continues to pay the price for Bin Laden’s death, with his supporters striking a town not far from Islamabad just days later, killing more than 80 people.
Whether Shaikh can balance the IMF’s demands with ordinary people’s needs will not only determine the Pakistani economy’s direction, but will also have an enormous impact on how Pakistan and its citizens view the world.
Despite all the stakeholders – Pakistan’s army and government, as well as Western countries – knowing the scale of recent army action in Swat and Buner, millions of innocent people were left to fend for themselves as bombs rained down on them from the sky.
Pakistanis, on the other hand, are the people actually living with that threat.
Only occasionally was the fighting “officially” reported.
The Pakistani army would rather be seen as the country’s savior than own up to its own shortsightedness and make clear whether it has decided to change course by obeying the constitution.
As the Oslo Summit on Education for Development approaches, I remain firm in my commitment to securing the right to a high-quality education for every child in Pakistan – especially for girls, who have long faced high barriers to education. But there remain considerable obstacles to fulfilling that commitment.
Those steps include cooperation with provincial governments – which bear the primary responsibility for primary and secondary education in Pakistan – to devise a roadmap for universal enrollment. In order to improve the quality of teaching and learning, we are working not only to expand facilities for teacher training, but also to draw more talented people to the profession by recognizing and honoring the service of teachers.
For Pakistan, education is not merely a priority – it is a policy imperative.
Because Arabic makes no distinction between chairman and president, the Israelis accepted use of the Arabic word rayyes in the official English text.
At the same time, no PLO official is likely to seek the presidency without Abbas’s approval, which he will withhold until a new mechanism for ending the occupation is found.
Finally, there is Nasser al-Qudwa, the former PLO representative at the United Nations.
But the reality is more complicated, and marked by repeated failures to create a coherent body politic, even when historical opportunities beckoned.
More Palestinians were killed by contending militias than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces.
The more moderate Haifa Arabs tried, not very successfully, to stay out of the fray.
To be sure, there is a lot of blame to go around.
It is ironic that Netanyahu, of all people, is accusing anyone of incitement.
And that anger is already intense, especially among young Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.
The two-state solution might not be particularly attractive to either party anymore; but a binational solution, at least as it is unfolding these days, would be a living nightmare.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now set his conditions for dialogue.
Abbas must also share power with more disciplined, younger leaders.
Moreover, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia – the three main Sunni Muslim regimes – are concerned that Gaza could provide a base for their regional non-Arab foe, Shiite Iran.
Ever protective of his position as sole leader of the Palestinian people, Arafat sought to block any means by which a potential rival could challenge him.
Abbas will thus need to find support within this rising generation of nationalist leaders if he is to succeed.
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are highly disciplined organizations, exercising tight control over their political and military wings.
Israel must also free Palestinian prisoners, remove all checkpoints between Palestinian villages and town, and redeploy its forces to positions held prior to September 28, 2000, in accordance with phase I of the Road Map.
As a result, one thing that both Israelis and Palestinians agree on is that the proximity talks will most likely lead nowhere, so both sides are currently busy ensuring that the other side will be blamed for the failure.
It might even force Israel to make decisions that until now it found easier to avoid.
Palestinians identify strongly with the civil rights movement in the United States.
Yet we made this historic compromise because we believed that doing so would bring us to the threshold of liberty.
Not only has Israel failed to halt its settlement activity since Annapolis – in violation of international law and its renewed road map commitments – but it has actually accelerated such activity.
Our Declaration of Independence is now twenty years old. The Arab Peace Initiative has been collecting dust for over six years.
Moreover, men occupy all 23 seats on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Governing Council.
But MEPs then failed to propose a plausible female alternative, leaving the ECB understaffed for weeks during the eurozone sovereign-debt crisis.
Neither Yellen nor Flug was held back by a lack of academic credentials – both are accomplished scholars – or by the catch-all charge of having “limited experience.”
To be sure, the selection of the 41-year-old Mogherini scores well for gender, age, and political affiliation.
So it is disturbing, to say the least, that with Ukraine at war with Russia, and the Middle East in a spiraling crisis of fanaticism, Europe’s leaders did not seek a candidate with a proven ability to forge an effective foreign policy from different – and often opposite – positions.
Both women would have been more convincing appointments, particularly to those, like Vladimir Putin, who do not wish the EU well.
Is the Italian government really so eager to take the lead on EU foreign policy? If so, where is the plan?
Roughly 50,000 North Korean workers are employed in 123 factories that produce about $450 million worth of goods (mainly textiles, shoes, and household goods).
But political and historical tensions continue to shape daily life in Kaesong, where companies operate under the constant threat that North Korea, for whatever reason, will react rashly, even abandoning the joint project altogether.
Detailed packing instructions were issued, informing us that we could not bring radios, mobile phones, wireless devices, printed materials, photos, cassette tapes, or DVDs.
Nonetheless, our pre-trip “indoctrination” stifled our reactions, regrettably preventing us from trying harder to reach out to the workers we encountered – an experience that seemed to exemplify the difficulty of bringing North Korea into the international community.
Governments around the world communicated with their citizens using social-media platforms: the United Kingdom’s embassy in France tweeted information for travelers, and the United States’ embassy there provided updates via Facebook.
According to unpublished Ipsos MORI research that was made available to me recently, when it comes to judging a company, honesty and integrity are more important than ever. Consumer confidence is being steadily eroded by a number of factors that lead people to question the extent to which they are valued.
CAMBRIDGE – How should one evaluate the agreement reached in Paris this month at the United Nations climate change conference? No sooner was the deal announced on December 12 than the debate erupted.
That had to change, partly because it is in developing countries, not the advanced economies, that emisssions are growing the fastest.
This is important because it is cheaper to pay a poor country to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants than it is to shut down an existing plant in a rich country.
This was a reasonable outcome in a difficult situation.
But the best way to address these fairness concerns is through the agreed emissions targets.
It is no such thing.
So, the extra 0.7°C rise is simply made up: climate policies can’t take credit for reducing it, because it was never going to happen in the first place.
Just 12 years later, great expectations were met with utter failure at the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen.
Many environmental campaigners are outraged by my scientific analysis showing how little Paris will matter.
I did not include this promise in my calculations, because for now it is mostly political grandstanding, being at least 15-20 years away from having any real-world impact.
OSLO – In the early 1990s, when I was Prime Minister of Norway, I once found myself debating sustainable development with an opposition leader who insisted that I tell him the government’s single most important priority in that field.
There is no guarantee that the agreement reached in Paris will work.
By that year, at least 27% of the EU’s energy is to come from renewable sources.
That, I might have told my opponent a generation ago, is the positive side of everything being connected.
Mengingat lambatnya kemajuan sejak konferensi perubahan iklim PBB yang pertama pada tahun 1995, perjanjijan apapun yang melibatkan semua anggota Konvensi Kerangka Kerja Perubahan Iklim PBB akan dianggap sebagai kesuksesan bersejarah.
Meskipun semua negara bersungguh-sungguh memenuhi janjinya, dunia akan mengalami kenaikan suhu setidaknya 3°C.
Dengan demikian, kebangkitan pendekatan bottom-up dalam perjuangan melawan perubahan iklim merupakan kemajuan yang berharga.
In the next 15 years, the world’s cities are set to grow dramatically, becoming home to 60% of the world’s 8.5 billion people.
Upending the status quo will be no easy feat.
Spurred by increased public awareness and mounting evidence that national economies can reap net benefits from policies to mitigate climate change, governments worldwide are pledging to do so – and taking to multilateral forums to display those commitments.
Already, this new model has helped to encourage national participation and enhance transparency, with national policies being published openly on the UNFCCC website.
The G-7 has recognized that decarbonization – the only safe haven from disastrous climate change – is the ultimate goal this century.
There are two paths to 2030.
We need to get to around 50 grams per kilowatt-hour by 2050, not 500 grams per kilowatt-hour.
The allure of the short-term fix is very powerful, especially to politicians watching the election cycle.
PARIS – “France’s 9/11.”
Both cities incarnate a similar universal dream.
At the time, I felt that it was a dangerous and unnecessary – and thus politically irresponsible – provocation.
But how long will national unity prevail? The scars of colonialism are fresher in France than anywhere else in Europe; the country has Europe’s largest Muslim minority; and, with moderates seeming particularly weak and divided, the extreme right is cresting in opinion polls.
The cause remains unknown, preventing us from arresting the disease’s development – though environmental and occupational factors loom large in recent research.
There is no treatment to slow the inevitable progression of the disease, and we do not know why the dopamine-generating brain cells begin to die off.
In the 1980s, six drug addicts developed acute Parkinson-like symptoms after accidentally injecting drugs contaminated with MPTP, which is structurally similar to the pesticide paraquat.
There is some evidence of increased risk associated with exposure to trichloroethylene, commonly used in the textile industry and in the manufacture of pesticides and other chemicals.
Nowadays the two largest parties can rarely hope to muster two-thirds of the popular vote. Not infrequently they have to form a “grand coalition.”
In some cases, they are individuals like President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela (and other Latin American leaders) or Italy’s ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
It does not take long for voters to discover that the promises of populists were empty.
Existing parties urgently need to recapture the support of citizens.
The Musharraf-allied faction of the Muslim League party (PML-Q) came in third, polling only 15%, despite the assistance of surgical vote-rigging.
Sharif has called for Pakistan’s foreign policy to be debated in parliament, but supports continued cooperation with the United States.
Vice President Dick Cheney’s office also is reportedly playing an active role.
So what is to be done about the “grey zone” to Europe’s east – the six countries that now lie between the EU and Russia? Inaction is unacceptable.
Georgia’s Mikheil Saakashvili is dealing with domestic protests after his disastrous military misadventure in August 2008.
To be sure, the EU’s technocratic focus on structural reforms is having some effect in the region.
The EU pledges to help set up “Western-type public institutions” and to transform the Eastern economies through comprehensive free-trade agreements.
Not only do more than 190 countries now belong to the UN; publicly funded international institutions have proliferated, with not one multilateral institution having been shuttered since WWII.
For example, embedding sunset clauses in the governance structures of publicly funded international institutions would ensure regular reviews of organizational performance and purpose.
As outcomes improve, international bodies’ legitimacy would be strengthened, which over time would enhance countries’ willingness to delegate powers to them.
But if governments, businesses, and civil society work together, they are feasible – promising a more sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous future for all.
Bachelet has also vowed to reform the tax system to reduce inequality, strengthen the state’s role in the pension system, and improve the quality and coverage of the health-care system. She has even promised a new constitution.
Some critics have warned that a hard left turn awaits Chile under Bachelet.
But it has only recently been acknowledged as having the continent’s largest economy – 26th in the world – following the release of “rebased” data putting GDP at $510 billion last year.
Despite widespread poverty and low (though improving) productivity in almost all industries outside of the resources sector, Nigeria has a rapidly growing consumer class that will play an increasingly important role in driving growth.
The spate of Internet startups that have emerged in Nigeria demonstrates that the skills are there, and tapping Nigeria’s diaspora can augment that talent pool.
किगाली - यह स्वप्न कि इक्कीसवीं सदी ‘अफ्रीकी सदी’ होगी अपने आप में शक्तिशाली और मदहोशकारी कल्पना है.


Reading The Samuelson Sampler, it is extraordinary to realize just how confident economists of his generation were that the New Economics (as the Keynesian approach was called in America) had solved the problem of depression and mass unemployment.
The Republican Richard Nixon was elected US President in 1968 on a platform of scaling down the Democrats’ expensive Great Society programs.
How can we have full employment and also price stability?”
Instead, they have relied on monetary expansion, which is politically more acceptable, but also much weaker in its effects, as it is undermined – just as Keynes predicted – by “several slips between the cup and the lip.”
In other words, “real” microeconomic thinking should be left to the experts.
A case in point is the economics of two-sided markets, which involve competition between platforms whose principal “product” consists in connecting two categories of users, who then offer each other network benefits.
In short, with a solid understanding of the difference between complements and substitutes, one can do almost everything the fancy models do – without hiring a single expensive expert.
Given scarce public funds and fiscal constraints, to increase spending, users must cover a higher share of the costs.
One approach is to create policies that raise the standards of unreliable transport and logistics companies.
The congestion and urban chaos that is typical in a port area, for example, must be eliminated through better planning.
These sorts of reforms bring massive returns relative to the investment required to finance them.
Just as Facebook “friends” come in varying degrees of intensity, quality, and symmetry, so does attention.
Juan and Alice exchanging attention may or may not be a fair trade, depending on their relative “value”: Is Alice extraordinarily beautiful?
That kind of attention can be valued by looking at the premium that people pay for it.
In response, many companies are now beginning to provide metrics to their customers for their behavior vis-à-vis that particular vendor.
This is the only prudent stance for South Korea to adopt when face-to-face negotiations with the North begin on February 8.
Economic failure, chronic food shortages, mounting public distrust of and animosity toward Kim’s government, and an apparent reluctance within elements of the North Korean military to go to war all point to the regime’s increasing fragility.
Moreover, nuclear brinkmanship is a particularly poor tactic, since Kim’s behavior is now becoming fused in American minds with arguably the most serious strategic threat on the US agenda: Iran’s push to secure nuclear weapons of its own.
Assuming that China does not approve of this unholy alliance, it has a responsibility to call a halt to these exchanges.
The number of illegal Jewish settlements and settlers has more than doubled in the areas Israel occupied in 1967.
Instead, Netanyahu stuck his fingers in America’s eyes, counting on the Republicans’ mid-term election victory to help him afterwards.
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s latest chapter in his two-year plan – the “home stretch to freedom” – will be complete in August 2011.
The international community’s old approach was to prioritize stability over democracy and pursue Israeli-Arab peace on a completely separate diplomatic track.
The US should not be selective in its support for freedom and democracy.
Bad perceptions only complicate future peace efforts, making a breakthrough even less likely.
Despite the fragile ceasefire in Lebanon, the risks of a widening war in the Middle East remain.
This approach continues despite its persistent failure.
The war party appears to be trying to whip up American public opinion in support of a wider conflict.
What unites us is vastly greater than what divides us.
JERUSALEM – Not since the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks during President Bill Clinton’s last days in the White House has the Middle East seen such a frenetic pace of peace diplomacy as it is seeing today.
Ehud Olmert, an especially unpopular prime minister whose days leading the government are probably numbered, lacks the legitimacy to throw the country into another bloody war, which given conditions in Gaza would be both costly and inconclusive.
After all, it was tiny Qatar that brokered Lebanon’s domestic settlement, Egypt that mediated the Gaza cease-fire, and Turkey that is facilitating the Israeli-Syrian talks.
Peace or Poison
The Nazis looked at Jews as a strain of “microbes,” and it was for this reason that they wanted to destroy them so brutally and meticulously.
If Iran gains nuclear weapons, it may, like Nazi Germany before it, be engulfed by murderous folly, threatening disaster for Israel.
The Palestinian leadership knows that if Iran ever launches a nuclear attack against Israel, their people would suffer terribly as well.
For Palestinians, the first step in real peace talks must include some accord on the basic issues of borders and security.
Former United States senator George Mitchell represents a relatively neutral third party supervising the current talks.
But no sooner had the parties left Washington after the talks broke down than Clinton joined Israel's then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak in blaming the Palestinians.
But, until that happy day arrives, or at least until the two sides have reached the contours of an agreement, direct talks and photo opportunities should be considered counter-productive.
Unlike in other countries, where guerrillas pursued exclusively political demands, Colombia’s guerilla groups became involved in drug trafficking, which transformed them into lethal institutional monsters, one part subversive organization and one part criminal mafia.
The government’s commitment to the fight against terrorism has already caused FARC’s membership to plummet, from more than 20,000 a decade ago to little more than 8,000 today.
But, given that the guerrillas have thwarted Colombians’ hopes in the past, we are approaching the negotiations with cautious optimism.
Reaching an agreement with the FARC to end the conflict – which implies the group’s disarmament and demobilization – would allow Colombia’s star to shine more brightly than ever.
The conflict in Northern Ireland was always territorial: not even the most radical Irish Republican group ever denied the legitimacy of Great Britain – only its rule over the six northern provinces of what they consider United Ireland.  The crux of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, by contrast, only partly concerns Israel’s borders.
Now that the talks are to begin, will they achieve anything substantial, or will the summit in Washington merely be another photo opportunity, like President George W. Bush’s Annapolis summit in 2007? Only an unreconstructed optimist would give the talks more than a 50% chance of succeeding.
The failure to reach agreement under such apparently auspicious conditions does not bode well for the coming talks.
Obama’s projected budgets do not change that.
It is easy to see how the persistence of instability in Iraq, Iranian influence, and al-Qaeda’s presence will lead American policymakers to take the “safe” route of continued military involvement.
After one recent disaster, in which more than 100 civilians died, the Pentagon immediately insisted that such bombing operations would continue.
Before investing hundreds of billions of dollars more in failing military operations, the Obama administration should re-think its policy and lay out a viable strategy to US citizens and the world.
This policy change is a necessary parallel to the military action now taking place.
Because the main short-term challenge in any transition to peace is national reconciliation, the political objective of peace should prevail at all times over the economic or financial objective of development if the two ever clash, as they often do.
In the case of Afghanistan, it may also require a sharp reduction in Taliban financing from drug-related activities, as well as targeted military operations to destroy insurgency hideouts in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The Annapolis peace conference ended a seven-year freeze on negotiations, with President George W. Bush asking the conflict’s main protagonists to reach an agreement by the end of 2008.
Infrastructure investment would then follow. 
It points to a stark truth: In a shockingly short time, we have become completely dependent on the Internet, a frontier we are only beginning to comprehend, let alone map and regulate.
But not everyone was convinced.
Lobbyists sought to water down the proposed legislation, with telecommunications companies particularly opposed to its net-neutrality provisions.
But with the Internet, mobile technologies, and social media all but eliminating such costs in many sectors, this economic structure is bound to change.
And the peer-to-peer lending market, which bypasses banks and their hefty hidden fees, surpassed the $1 billion mark in early 2012.
Recognizing these benefits, some communities are actively supporting the maker movement and accelerating the development of frugal economies.
Traditional companies must get on board – or risk becoming obsolete.
Women and children suffer the most in times of conflict.
At the same time, the Russian government must be pressured to pull out of the Caucasus and let people there decide their future for themselves.
This means that some people know more about some things than other people.
The lemons squeeze out the oranges.
But just as in used-car and insurance markets, asymmetric information in finance leads to trouble.
The theorists of asymmetric information occupy a deviant branch of mainstream economics.
Herd behavior arises, Keynes thought, not from attempts to deceive, but from the fact that, in the face of the unknown, we seek safety in numbers.
It is known that Chinese leaders had hoped that Kim Jong-il would survive long enough to consolidate support among the country’s various factions for the succession of his son, Kim Jong-un.
In turn, the EU initiated an extensive humanitarian aid project.
Is that possible? Could it be done quickly enough to boost other regional players’ confidence that the country’s evolution will be predictable?
In the case of North Korea, where nuclear arms are in play, it cannot afford to be.
We may have a superficial check-box understanding of what the companies behind this convenience do with our data; but, beyond the marketing, the actual people running these organizations are faceless and nameless.
Recently, hackers misappropriated photos sent via Snapchat, a service used primarily by young people that promises auto-deletion of all files upon viewing.
Consumers believe or expect that someone somewhere is keeping an eye on this, but who exactly would that be?
The Challenge of Medical Empowerment
People who do these things are healthier on average.
Yet we seem to be heading toward a world in which self-anointed saints and blamers face off against supposed sinners and suspects.
BUT SO WHAT?
Statistically, that is a known association.
Musharraf may be counting on the army, his primary constituency, to bail him out of this crisis.
Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid, and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaeda in the region, its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best.
Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy.
This perverse strategy sounds almost unbelievable.
Jamia Hafsa students in Islamabad demonstrating for enforcement of Islamic law, March 2007.
In a radio broadcast on April 12, the clerics issued a threat: “ There will be suicide blasts in the nook and cranny of the country.
There is no harm in it. There are far more horrible punishments in the hereafter for such women.
The Case for Better Government
The problem for governments, more often than not, is that in attempting to respond to and reconcile often conflicting individual, family, and national needs, their ability to deliver results efficiently and effectively has declined.
Globalization – the breaking down of national boundaries and the integration of economies across continents – has resulted in burgeoning demands on governments at the same time that their ability to provide answers has been reduced.
Since the demise of the Doha Round, the WTO’s standing as a multilateral negotiating forum has declined sharply, salvaged in part by the recent agreement in Bali.
GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA – Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II are the odd couple of modern Roman Catholicism.
But that does not mean that it will be smooth sailing.
In recent decades, lay managers and workers in the church’s network of schools, hospitals, and social-service providers have largely replaced priests and nuns.
At the same time, Francis’s Jesuit background has instilled in him a certain independence and flair for the quirky (like nonchalantly sanctifying John XXIII and John Paul II in one fell swoop).
Different answers to that question are possible.
Three Israeli civilians have been killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza, and 64 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground invasion began.
In contrast to previous episodes, Arab countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have been very restrained in their criticism of Israel, though perhaps less for moral reasons and more because they regard militant Islam as a graver threat than Israel to their own regimes.
We can acknowledge that Israel has made some efforts to do that, but we must still say: It is not enough.
Once Newman had an idea, it seems, he liked to work out all of the variations.
In a 1987 interview with a group of art critics, Koons referred to the work that was sold last month, calling it “the ‘Jim Beam’ work.”
When Christie’s put Koons’s work up for auction, the toy train filled with bourbon sold for $33 million.
Such behavior would lead people to ask: “In a world in which more than six million children die each year because they lack safe drinking water or mosquito nets, or because they have not been immunized against measles, couldn’t you find something better to do with your money?”
At a press conference last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted a justification.
Including them might add as many as 25 million to the number of those who suffered terribly as a result of Stalin’s tyranny.
But communism under Stalin was the opposite of egalitarian, for it gave absolute power to a few, and denied all rights to the many.
America’s Drone Dilemma
In 2006, I wrote about a US missile attack on a house in Damadola, a Pakistani village near the Afghan border, in which 18 people were killed, including five children.
That low number surprised many observers.
Doing so would only lead to the US being seen as an occupying army – a perception that would yield “a torrent of unintended consequences.”
Independence for a small state outside of a political and economic group like the EU would be risky nowadays.
Artur Mas, President of Catalonia’s regional government, has vowed to go ahead with a non-binding referendum anyway.
If other remedies fail in such a situation, secession might be justified as a last resort, even if it imposes heavy costs on the rump state.
Philosophy on Top
What I do know something about, however, is my own discipline, philosophy, which, through its practical side, ethics, makes a vital contribution to the most urgent debates that we can have.
GDI aims to identify “the thinkers and ideas that resonate with the global infosphere as a whole.”
There are the Philosophy Bites podcasts, many blogs, and free online courses, which are attracting tens of thousands of students.
With these words, posted online, Gillian Bennett, an 85-year-old New Zealander living in Canada, began her explanation of her decision to end her life.
In an interview published in 2008 in the Church of Scotland’s magazine Life and Work, she supported the right of those suffering intolerably to end their lives. “If somebody absolutely, desperately wants to die because they’re a burden to their family, or the state,” she argued, “then I think they too should be allowed to die.”
Such a change would remove the anxiety that some patients with progressive dementia have that they will go on too long and miss the opportunity to end their life at all.
Here is one.
Likewise, McDonald’s initial response to criticism of its suppliers’ animal-welfare practices was to sue the activists who made the allegations.
Where land has already been acquired without such consent, and the acquisition is in dispute, Oxfam wants the corporations to insist on fair dispute-resolution procedures.
MELBOURNE – Should your government be able to take away your citizenship?
Nevertheless, Sakr discontinued his appeal, apparently because he was concerned that the use of his cellphone was revealing his location to US intelligence services.
The legislation currently before the UK Parliament does not require any judicial or public proof even of the weaker claim that someone’s presence in the country is not conducive to the public good.
If that were the case with the decisions made by the UK government in 2013, there would still be a high probability that an innocent naturalized citizen was made stateless.
As 60 others scrambled to escape, the human traffickers carrying them to Europe stabbed them and threw them into the sea off the coast of Lampedusa.
For example, tiny Lebanon shelters more than one million of the three million Syrians who are displaced, whereas the EU – 100 times larger – has taken in only about 100,000.
Worse, this portrayal implies that little can be done to mitigate, or even prevent, such occurrences.
This would result in fewer asylum-seekers making life-threatening voyages that leave their families deeply indebted – human traffickers charge as much as €15,000 ($19,700) to cross the Mediterranean – only to be turned away.
This is significant, because Scotland is the strongest base of pro-European sentiment in the UK.
Juncker’s office coldly replied that important portfolios in the new Commission would go to major political figures, and that Juncker “does not owe [Cameron] anything.”
If Cameron’s advisers overestimated the support that they might have received from Merkel and others, they clearly underestimated the power and effectiveness of the European Parliament.
Indeed, it is difficult to see how a re-elected Cameron could maintain the Conservative Party’s unity without endorsing a “no” vote in the referendum on the outcome of his own renegotiation.
The most important finding of the GMF’s Transatlantic Trends survey is that concern about immigrants falls sharply when people are given even the most basic facts.
The average Swede, for example, believes that 18% of the country’s population is composed of migrants; the actual number is close to 13%.
For example, recent research&nbsp;in several countries shows that immigrants as a whole contribute more economically to their communities than they take from them.
Buy Back or Pay Forward?
And yet there is a good reason why the pharmaceutical industry can and should play a major role in financing something like a common “Innovation Fund” to provide financing for early-stage research into solving the problem of antimicrobial resistance.
It is difficult for an outside observer not to draw a connection between the two decisions.
Or, better yet, in a world confronted with a host of problems – from climate change to antimicrobial resistance – industry leaders should begin asking themselves how they can contribute to averting the crises of the future.
In its public pronouncements, the industry denies this by counting just four specific activities as marketing – sales visits to doctors, the value of free samples, direct-to-consumer advertisements, and advertisements in medical journals.
In the six years from 1998 to 2003, of the 487 drugs that entered the market, fully 78% were classified by the US Food and Drug Administration as likely to be no better than drugs already on the market.
They’re just re-jiggering the same old drugs, getting new patents and exclusivity, and relying on their marketing muscle to convince doctors and patients that they’re producing medical miracles.
वास्तव में, औसत रूप से, प्रारंभिक चरण के अनुसंधान में संभावित रूप से उपयोगी के रूप में पहचान किए गए प्रत्येक 10,000 यौगिकों में से केवल एक को ही अंततः नियामकों से मंजूरी प्राप्त होगी। अनुमोदन प्रक्रिया में 15 वर्ष जितना लंबा समय लग सकता है और इसमें सावधानी को वरीयता दी जाती है। यहाँ तक कि जो दवाएँ मानव चिकित्सीय परीक्षणों के लिए अनुमोदित होती हैं, उनमें से पाँच में से केवल एक दवा ही अंतिम बाधा को पार कर पाती है।
इन आँकड़ों को संदर्भ से जोड़ने के लिए, इस पर विचार करें कि यूएस नैशनल इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ़ हैल्थ बुनियादी चिकित्सा अनुसंधान के क्षेत्र में प्रतिवर्ष $30 बिलियन से कुछ अधिक की निधि लगाती है, और फ़ार्मास्युटिकल रिसर्च एंड मैन्युफ़ैक्चरर्स ऑफ़ अमेरिका के सदस्यों ने अनुसंधान एवं विकास पर पिछले वर्ष लगभग $51 बिलियन की राशि खर्च की थी। मेगाफ़ंड दृष्टिकोण से इन दोनों निवेशों के बीच धन की खाई को पाट देने पर दोनों निवेशों को और अधिक उत्पादक बनाने में मदद मिलेगी।

Despite unequivocal evidence of its positive social and economic impact, education – particularly at the preschool and primary levels – suffers from chronic under-investment.
First, the tax itself is a result of – and, as some may see it, a punishment for – the “bad” financial innovation that brought the global economy to its knees in 2008, hitting the world’s poorest people the hardest.
The type of institution that we have in mind should be a stand-alone organization operating as a registered investment bank and subject to capitalization, regulatory, statutory, and other requirements.
The Disenchantment of Europe
Merkel, together with the European Commission and the European Central Bank, threatened to deprive Greeks of the use of their own currency, the euro, unless their government accepted punitive conditions.
At Merkel’s behest and with the complicity of the ECB, which waited until July 2012 to quell a bond-market panic sparked by eurozone policymakers’ mistakes, the Commission also imposed eurozone-wide austerity, causing a cumulative loss of nearly 10% of GDP in 2011-13, according to the Commission’s own economic model.
In the parliament, a vocal but fragmented minority of critics, cranks, and bigots is likely to push the center-right and center-left groups, which still have a combined majority, to club together even more closely.
In office since February, he won a resounding 41% of the vote, twice that of his nearest rival.
Germany’s Economic Mirage
Written off as the “sick man of Europe” when the euro was launched in 1999, Germany responded not by boosting dynamism, but by cutting costs.
The brunt of the stagnation has been borne by German workers.
Why, then, are businesses unwilling to invest more in the country?
Slashing incomes depresses domestic spending and makes debts even less manageable.
LONDON – After a 16-hour marathon negotiating session ending on March 20, politicians, technocrats, and journalists were all keen to declare the deal on the final piece of Europe’s banking union a success. But appearances are deceptive.
The ECB will directly supervise bigger eurozone banks starting in November (the first step of the banking union), and now it is assessing the strength of their balance sheets.
At Germany’s insistence, the ECB will supervise only the eurozone’s 130 or so biggest banks.
The upshot is that the eurozone as a whole is likely to struggle with a zombie banking system, with only patchy efforts to restructure banks decisively and fairly.
As Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, I have seen firsthand the devastation and heartbreak caused by disasters around the world.
Countries like the Philippines continue to demonstrate the benefits of investing in preparedness, especially when done as part of a larger risk-mitigation effort.
In addition to assisting with emergency relief, it is crucial that the international community help to introduce basic procedures for responding long before disaster strikes.
There is little officials can do about that.
Today, however, about 90% of US breeding sows – the mothers of the pigs that are raised and killed for pork, bacon, and ham – spend most of their lives locked in cages that measure about two feet by seven feet (0.6 meters by 2.2 meters).
Individual stalls for sows, already outlawed in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned across the entire EU from 2013.
Americans seem to care just as much about animal welfare as Europeans do.
In the US, a nation that prides itself on its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are hardly the only losers.
Other judges and official bodies need to keep the pressure on Pinochet.
Pinochet’s ability to evade the courts cast a dark shadow over the country’s military institutions and made many Chileans wonder how far the country had really gone in its transition to democracy.
Powerful supporters defend him, using any underhanded means they can muster.
So it is unsettling that policymakers in many Western economies today resemble the second group of pilots.
Damaging discord has emerged within the troika itself, with a particularly disruptive impasse between Frankfurt, where the ECB resides, and Berlin, the seat of the German government.
Six important issues speak to the problem for policymakers in Europe, the US, and Japan.
Finally, communication has been dreadful.
Each country in every year faces a unique set of circumstances.
African households obtained access to modern medicine much later and more suddenly than people in other regions.
Taken together, African politics, demography, and the delayed arrival of new technologies imposed severe headwinds against per-capita growth of agricultural output in the last quarter of the twentieth century.
But African countries do have some things in common: widespread improvements in farm policy, improved demographic conditions, and the availability of new technologies create new opportunities for the decade ahead.
Abu Bakar Ba’asyir is a radical Muslim cleric who was convicted of blessing the original 2002 Bali bombing, and suspected by some of providing much more.
The proposed bill attracted support from moderate Muslim leaders, but its most vocal advocates were a collection of radical religious groups with a predilection for violence, led by the Islamic Defenders Front (known by its Indonesian acronym, FPI). This year alone, these self-appointed moral vigilantes have ransacked bars and nightclubs, attacked the American and Danish embassies, and stoned the offices of Playboy after its first edition – all with only occasional protests from the police.
A national dialogue about fostering pluralism is now in progress, and has inspired renewed public interest in Pancasila, the national philosophy discredited during the Suharto years but now seen by some as a symbol of Indonesia’s historic pluralism.
If the words of the Olympic Charter, stating that it is a goal of Olympism to “place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity,” are to be fulfilled, it is necessary for all Olympians to be able to learn about the real situation in China and to point out human rights violations freely whenever and wherever in line with their conscience.
Playing Russian Roulette with Climate Change
Decision-makers have not faced up to just how close the world may be to the climate “tipping point.”
In addition, it might be necessary to have a review conference in 2015 to adjust our targets and plans to the new realities.
Who would have imagined in the West ten years ago that the future and their children’s well-being would depend upon decisions taken in Beijing or Delhi or Addis Ababa?
Governments should not withhold the truth from their citizens.
Anglo-Saxon financial institutions are known for their high dividend-payout ratios.
Claims against the personal wealth of shareholders would be blocked by the limited liability constraint.
Such homeowners knew that with rising prices they would be able to realize a gain by either selling their homes or increasing their debt, while in the case of falling prices they could simply hand over the keys to their banks.
The US must carry out fundamental reforms of its financial system to plug the equity leaks and recover investors’ confidence.
हालांकि ये आंकड़े हाल के दशकों में हुई प्रगति को प्रतिबिंबित करते हैं, दुःख की बात तो यह है कि यदि सरकारें लगातार एक समय में केवल एक या दो उपायों पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने के प्रलोभन के आगे झुक नहीं जातीं तो इसमें बहुत अधिक सुधार हो सकता था। इन बीमारियों से होनेवाली बच्चों की मौतों को सदा के लिए समाप्त करने के लिए, सरकारों को चाहिए कि दो साल पहले विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन और यूनिसेफ द्वारा अपनी एकीकृत निमोनिया और डायरिया के लिए वैश्विक कार्य योजना में जिन हस्तक्षेपों की पहचान की गई थी वे उनका पूर्णरूपेण पालन करने के लिए प्रतिबद्धता दर्शाएँ।

In the Polish capital, Catholic and conservative parties, together with the “Solidarity” Trade Union, inspired by a reactionary Christian radio network, “Radio Maria,” gathered for political and cultural, rather than economic, reasons.
And can one blame them, given that Russia seems more nostalgic for its imperial tradition than ever?
It is not so much that its people want to leave the eurozone (or, for that matter, that many want their regions to leave Spain); rather, the country wants to remain itself – that is, to maintain a lifestyle that is largely the product of climate.
Today’s Poles do not believe that Europe has cheated them.
What is specific to Poland is that the past eight years have apparently created a pronounced case of cognitive dissonance. Annual GDP growth averaged 3.2% over this period; and, unlike in the rich West, both inequality and unemployment have actually fallen, with growth mainly benefiting the middle three quintiles of the income distribution.
Tusk praised Poles themselves for their hard work, but neglected to emphasize that without the government’s effective macroeconomic policies, that work would have been wasted. He never even reminded voters that the government’s choices in managing the fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis – which were neither obvious nor easy, because they required rejecting the EU’s austerity consensus – was the right one.
Poland’s New Golden Age
The Berlin Wall would not have fallen when and how it did without Poland’s Solidarność movement and its struggle for freedom and human rights.
Poland has the potential to become a European leader again.
Much of the world seems fascinated by the fact that Poland is now governed by a set of identical twins who first became famous as child movie actors: President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
Among the splinter groups that arose were the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) and the nationalist LPR.
The Kaczynskis want to destroy the “corrupt system composed of careerist politicians, post-communists, former secret service functionaries, and criminal organizations,” who, according to the twins, have ruled Poland since 1989.
To be sure, a political crisis can bring the coalition down, but this can happen only if Poland’s “wandering” electorate decides that the PiS has let it down.
लंदन - वर्तमान एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ, न केवल निमोनिया और मूत्र पथ संक्रमणों जैसी आम बीमारियों से लड़ने में, बल्कि तपेदिक और मलेरिया जैसे कई प्रकार के संक्रमणों का इलाज करने में भी अधिकाधिक निष्प्रभावी होती जा रही हैं, जो अब फिर से लाइलाज होने का जोखिम पैदा कर रहे हैं। जी-7 के नेताओं द्वारा "रोगाणुरोधी प्रतिरोध" (AMR) से निपटने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध होने के हाल ही के संयुक्त प्रस्ताव के साथ, अब अधिक समावेशी जी-20 - और चीन के लिए, जो पहली बार इस समूह की अध्यक्षता कर रहा है - इस लड़ाई को अगले स्तर तक ले जाने की बारी है।
सरकारों को प्रमुख सामाजिक मीडिया अभियान लागू करके इस प्रवृत्ति का लाभ उठाना चाहिए, जिसमें ऐसी चुस्त, निरोगी आदतों को उजागर किया जाए जिन्हें सभी लोगों को अपनाना चाहिए - इन आदतें से परोक्ष रूप से एंटीमाइक्रोबियल्स के लिए मांग कम होगी। ऐसे अभियान की कम लागत और संभावित रूप से मिलनेवाला उच्च लाभ इसे और भी ज़्यादा आकर्षक बना देता है।

At the same time, the information society and globalization have made ours a more insecure world, where we experience risks that politics-as-usual has been unable to address.
But what are these lighthouses? In an information society they will be those who are trusted to be able to help interpret or analyse what is happening.
President George W. Bush projects this style very openly.
Obviously, there is a point where a leader must commit to a decision.
It takes power away from people in their own names, but gives them fear rather than confidence.
Similarly, Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), has taken to governing in a way that is unraveling a decade of progress,&#160;one marked by economic dynamism, rapid growth, and the subordination of the armed forces to civilian control.
Many AKP constituencies are wary of cultural conflict, if only because it threatens their economic interests.
But changes in the judiciary’s composition, Gül’s 2008 accession to the presidency, and a 2010 constitutional amendment allowing military officials to be tried in civilian courts contributed to the gradual loosening of restrictions on Erdoğan’s authority.
Morsi was able to rule without restraint, trampling freely on citizens’ fundamental rights, because the military regime that assumed control after Hosni Mubarak’s 2011 ouster scheduled presidential elections before a constitution was adopted.
Bentham did not rush to publish his work.
Bentham accepts that it may be to the advantage of the community that the law should confer certain rights on people.
Conditioning the Arab Transition
Economic reforms, on the other hand, can wait.
And, as in Egypt, the protracted transition risks faltering under the weight of rising political violence and socioeconomic decline.
The most important task will be to create a new type of political conditionality.
Now, at long last, the West has an opportunity – by providing concrete and generous support for political transition – to bring its values and its interests into alignment.
History abounds with episodes when strategic ambiguity would have been beneficial.
Massive violence against civilian populations is “pacification,” and ethnic cleansing is a “transfer of population.”
The difference is not difficult to discern.
Obama learned this the hard way, when he drew a “red line” against Syria’s use of chemical weapons and then failed to act forcefully when Syria crossed that line.
This is a reality around the world: too many political leaders are ignoring a growing environmental crisis, imperiling their own countries and others.
In California, this winter has been another dry season in a bitter four-year drought, one of the most severe in the region's history.
Almost all studies of human-induced climate change show that the Mediterranean region, including security hotspots like Libya, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, and Syria, is likely to experience a further significant decline in rainfall, compounding the drying trend that has occurred during the past quarter-century.
Many politicians, no doubt, will be grateful for the support of their universities, NGOs, and leading businesses.
Think of the excellent work it has done in the area of competition policy: breaking up cartels and stopping state aid, even when it comes in disguised forms, such as government guarantees on company debt.
The problem is aggravated by the composition of the new Commission.
That law prevents any shareholder who controls more than 20% of voting shares in Volkswagenwerk GmbH (VW) from casting more than 20% of the votes in a shareholders' meeting.
Politics and Corporate Money
To prevent this, lawmakers should adopt safeguards for political spending decisions that would limit the divergence of such decisions from shareholder interests.
Lawmakers also should consider providing public investors with a say over political spending decisions.
The Politics of Economic Stupidity
The malaise afflicting today’s global economy might be best reflected in two simple slogans: “It’s the politics, stupid” and “Demand, demand, demand.”
But even in the US, there are roughly 650,000 fewer public-sector employees than there were before the crisis; normally, we would have expected some two million more.
Meanwhile, in Russia, we can expect Western sanctions to slow growth, with adverse effects on an already weakened Europe.
Demand is what the world needs most.
Unfortunately, spent-fuel storage has been “an afterthought,” as Ernest Moniz, Director of the Energy Initiative at MIT, puts it.
That, in turn, would cause substantial amounts of radioactive material to be released if containment structures are breached, potentially resulting in an area of contamination greater than that caused by the Chernobyl accident in 1986.
Use of plutonium fuels also increases the risk of nuclear-weapons proliferation.
To minimize this risk, casks should be developed that can easily be transferred to a secure interim storage facility while permanent repositories receive approval.
In his pre-Christmas speech to the Roman Curia, the pope did not mention rape, let alone the sexual murder in Delhi.
Marriage is a way to contain our dangerous desires.
The men were not uneducated, but they were unable to cope with the freedoms of contemporary women.
But the more sex is repressed and people are made to fear it the greater the chance of sexual violence, because anyone who might possibly stir our sexual desires, man or woman, becomes a potential target of our rage.
He asked her if she wanted to leave seven orphans.
First, leaving aside the “ideological" question of whether family planning is a right, there is overwhelming evidence to show that a lack of access to contraception is bad for women's health.
Moreover, an overwhelming majority of scientists in the relevant fields believe that we are on track to exceed the level of global warming at which feedback mechanisms will kick in and climate change will become uncontrollable, with unpredictable and possibly catastrophic consequences.
Who could oppose such an obvious win-win proposition? The only naysayers, we may suspect, are those in the grip of a religious ideology that they seek to impose on others, no matter what the consequences for women, children, and the rest of the world, now and for centuries to come.
Laudatio Si has received considerable media attention, most of it focused on its uncompromising call for action on climate change.
Our “dominion” over the universe, he declares, should be understood “in the sense of responsible stewardship.”
Although animal advocates implored Ratzinger to reiterate his views on animal welfare after he became Pope, he never did so.
Mengikuti seruan Paus Fransiskus untuk mengambil tindakan bukan hanya isu moral; tapi merupakan isu praktis.
Hutan dimana masyarakat adat tinggal seringkali menyimpan karbon dalam jumlah lebih besar dibandingkan dengan hutan yang dikelola oleh pemilik lain, baik pemerintah atau swasta.
A Papal Education
In Zambia and Mali, for example, only two children in ten can read after two years in school; in Afghanistan and South Sudan, only three adult women in ten can read.
In the US, a comprehensive review of more than 3,000 studies found that low adult reading skills were directly related to higher rates of morbidity and worse health.
LONDON – It’s a dollar to a cent that Pope Francis’s visit to the United States in September will be one of the biggest news stories of 2015.
He embodies the message, delivered in the Gospel of St. Matthew’s account of the Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness” (Matthew 5:6).
Nonetheless, in parts of the American political establishment, Israel – specifically, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his Likud Party – can do no wrong.
In 1891, Pope Leo XIII produced Rerum Novarum, an encyclical on workers’ rights that fundamentally challenged the contemporary political discourse and approach to policymaking.
The chief Jesuit confessor at the papal court used to be called “the black pope,” owing to his simple black cassock (if not his sinister intent).
At the same time, Francis has launched a series of initiatives aimed at pleasing just about everyone.
This is not a new situation.
He can scold – a tack that Francis has so far tried to avoid – but he cannot convince.
One could argue that concessions on this front would simply acknowledge attitudinal and behavioral reality and allow the church to move on.
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, despite concerted efforts at eradication and crop substitution, Afghanistan produced 87% of the world’s opium in 2005 – roughly 4.1 tons – generating $2.7 billion of illegal revenue, which amounts to roughly 52% of the country’s GDP.
The result of this was laid out in a report by the European Union’s Election Observation Mission that I presented in Kabul last December: Afghanistan risks becoming a “rentier” state with easy access to resources that lubricate corruption throughout its entire political system, finance illegal armed groups, and fuel regional destabilization.
It would also provide Afghan peasants, who have been growing poppy despite forced eradication of the plant and incentives to change crops, with an option that is regulated by law and that, in time, could have an impact on the heroin trade.
Paradoxically, the EU – seen as a guarantee of stability and progress – is itself part of the problem.
Tomas G. Masaryk, Czechoslovakia’s first president after its establishment in 1918, used to say that his country was a democracy, but “so far, without democrats.”
Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party, which could win Hungary’s elections next spring, provides a particularly instructive example.
To understand why, it is helpful to take a broad view of Latin America’s history and economic development.
Democracy in Latin America has been a hard-won struggle.
In Peru, for example, Alejandro Toledo is that country’s first indigenous president.
Measuring the Next Global Development Goals
The task amounts to this generation’s greatest opportunity to translate high aspirations into concrete targets.
There is no shortage of information available online about the number of poor people in almost any country in any year since 1990; but much of it is based on sketchy data.
In 2013, a high-level panel of politicians and civil-society and private-sector leaders advocated the creation of “better data-collection systems, especially in developing countries.”
Given capacity constraints, particularly in the poor countries, this cost is likely to be high.
Post-American Israel
The next US president, whether he is Barack Obama or John McCain, will certainly maintain the close bilateral alliance.
In their effort to achieve international respect and legitimacy as responsible stakeholders in today’s evolving international system, countries such as China, India, and even Russia have a greater interest in stability than in global confusion.
Traditional bodies such as the Organization of American States and the Andean Community of Nations – in which US influence is a defining feature – have weakened, making way for Chávez’s Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).
In other areas, diplomacy would be quieter and less ideological with Capriles as president, but it would be no less ambitious.
For example, Ecuador, under a Chávez-allied government led by President Rafael Correa, has not adopted Venezuela’s openly confrontational model of relations with the US.
Some argue that these countries are inherently unstable. Their political cultures are underdeveloped.
As a result, their historic mission doomed them.
Polish Prime Minister Lezsek Miller resigned one day after his country's official admission to the EU.
Post-National Football?
The fans of national sides are actors in a kind of patriotic carnival, dressed in the costumes of their national stereotypes: English fans as medieval knights, the Dutch in clogs, the Spanish as bullfighters.
In fact, the reality of football styles is rather more complicated.
They are, to use his phrase, “mercenaries.”
The best European clubs are all multinational now.
Uribe’s absence has opened the election in unforeseen ways.
Both have ingeniously mobilized young people and made innovative use of online social networks.
Obviously the FARC guerrillas – much diminished by Uribe, but still violently opposed to Colombian democracy – remain a source of concern for many Colombians.
PARIS – In normal life, technicalities are better left to technicians.
Similarly, a credit-fueled construction boom drives output above potential, resulting in inflation.
The European Union has an additional problem: in response to the sovereign crisis, most of its members agreed in 2011 to a “fiscal compact” requiring them to keep their structural budget deficit – the one they would record were output equal to potential – below 0.5% of GDP.

But relentless attempts at accuracy easily result in noise.
A greater degree of stability in the assessment of an economy’s potential would strengthen decision-makers’ awareness and appreciation of longer-term challenges, thereby putting policymaking on a sounder footing.
At-home positions, frequently filled by women, are also on the rise.
The estimated 330 million working women who lived below the poverty line in 2008-2009 accounted for roughly 60% of the 550 million working poor worldwide.
Although all countries offer some kind of social protection or security, in most countries, coverage is severely limited and targeted at specific groups.
Half of the world’s population uses solid fuel, such as wood, charcoal, or dung, for cooking.
The financial implications of ensuring universal energy access are large, but not overwhelming when weighed against the enormous benefits.
We need a firm commitment from all sides: private businesses, academia, civil society, and international organizations and NGOs.
विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन (डब्ल्यूएचओ) ने इस महामारी से निबटने में अंतर्राष्ट्रीय मदद जुटाने में केंद्रीय भूमिका निभाई है. इसमें राष्ट्रीय सरकारों तथा डॉक्टर्स विदआउट बॉर्डर्स और अमेरिकी रोग नियंत्रण एवं रोकथाम केंद्रों ने भी अहम योगदान दिया. महामारी अभी भी फैल रही है. जन-स्वास्थ्य समुदाय इससे निपटने के लिए गंभीर प्रयास कर रहा है. क्लिनिक कर्मियों, महामारी विशेषज्ञों तथा अन्य विशेषज्ञों की तैनाती के लिए 10 करोड़ डॉलर कोष का इस्तेमाल किया जा रहा है.
बरसात का मौसम निकट आ रहा है. इस मौसम में तरह-तरह की महामारियों के फैलने का खतरा बढ़ जाता है. इससे स्वास्थ्य-सेवा प्रणालियों की क्षमताओं पर जोर पड़ता है. तब इस बात की जरूरत बढ़ जाती है कि नागरिकों को इन महामारियों से निबटने के लिए प्रेरित किया जाए, प्रशिक्षित और न्यूनतम् सुविधाओं से सुसज्जित किया जाए. इस कार्य के लिए लक्षित विकास सहायता, घरेलू निवेश, विशेषज्ञ सहायता जैसे मिलेजुले प्रयासों के अलावा उप-सहारा देशों से जमीनी-स्तर का परिप्रेक्ष्य भी चाहिए जिन्होंने अपने समुदाय स्वास्थ्यकर्मियों के नेटवर्कों को सफलतापूर्वक ऊपर उठाया है.


अंत में, स्वास्थ्य सेवा की नई दुनिया में असीमित संभावना है क्योंकि इसकी सरहद उस स्थान को छूती है जहां हम रहते हैं और खेलते हैं. यह हम सभी को स्वास्थ्य सेवा विशेषज्ञ और अविष्कारक बनाती है. आखिरकार, किसी चिर रोग के खिलाफ लड़ाई घर में ही जीती या हारी जाएगी.
What is wrong with the precautionary principle? It appears to be a statement of the obvious: unacceptable disasters require extraordinary counter-measures.
There is no escape from balancing costs and benefits. There is no way we can avoid making difficult choices.
During the last 200 years, a period when we have had accurate measurements from tide gauges, the sea level has continued to rise slowly.
It would be unfortunate if China and India were to impoverish themselves by ceasing to burn coal, only to have the resulting decrease of snowfall over Greenland and Antarctica cause sea levels to rise faster.
Public security is a pre-requisite for freedom, and protecting freedom is at the core of a democratic state’s responsibility for public security.
In Germany, radicalization takes place largely through radical mosque communities or private prayer rooms, as well as through the Internet.
Our societies need to engender greater respect and acknowledgement of others, and to acquire more knowledge about different cultures and religions.
We need Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Maghreb countries as partners in the fight against Islamist terrorism, and that means improved operational cooperation between security authorities.
Even as the deal was announced, however, newspaper reports suggested that officials recognized that the measures would be insufficient to meet the target; further negotiations on additional steps would be needed at a politically more convenient moment.
Applying it in Greece would be a highly visible test; if successful, it would set a valuable precedent.
In September 2010, four months after the official Greek bailout was put in place, the IMF issued a pamphlet asserting that “default in today’s advanced economies is unnecessary, undesirable, and unlikely.”
The most reasonable comparison is with Latin American countries during their debt crises in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
Several proponents of these new ideas have openly used the analogy with drugs.
It is impossible to anticipate the numerous financial products that human ingenuity can create, and that can be dangerous to use but of great value to some.
In order to keep the system lean, there should be a provision for exempting some individuals and firms – those sophisticated enough to handle their own affairs, or well off enough to deal with financial failure – from the requirement of an RFP’s approval before buying a prescription financial product.
Now it is back in fashion in Washington.
Will Bush’s new approach succeed? On a recent trip to Europe, I encountered both encouragement and skepticism.
Even with these increases, there is a long way to go to improve America’s standing.
Nonetheless, the elections may have softened some of the sense of illegitimacy that has clouded Bush’s Iraq policy.
Egregious cases in the last century include the Holocaust in Nazi Germany, the Khmer Rouge killing fields in Cambodia, and the genocide in Rwanda.
But some other multiethnic societies such as Tanzania and Burkina Faso have largely escaped communal conflict.
While none of these groups represents a majority point of view, they do exert significant influence and probably believe that they are acting in the interest of the majority.
Democratic governments are often perceived as more respectful of minorities, given that, unlike autocratic regimes, a democratic system with an elected legislature, independent judicial system, strong civil society, and free press provides citizens with opportunities to express their views and pursue justice.
We have the knowledge to secure our future by improving the life prospects of all our young children.
Neuroscience and the biology of stress help us to begin to understand how poverty and other adversities are literally built into our bodies.
The scientific principles of early childhood development do not vary by family income, program type, or funding source.
Preventive Diplomacy, Not Pre-Emptive Strikes
The devastation in Lebanon will take generations to repair, not only materially, but also psychologically.
As well as taking collective action to stop the war in Lebanon and Gaza, key players like the “quartet” – the UN, the United States, the European Union, and Russia – must develop a comprehensive security framework for the Middle East.
Causing loss of lives does not contribute to the present or future welfare of the people of the region.
The Socialist International is committed to working hard with its partners in the region to make peace in the Middle East a reality.
Over the past 33 years, I have had plenty of opportunity to study both oil prices and foreign exchange rates, including overseeing a research department of talented people trying to predict their movements.
In 2011, after both prices had recovered from the collapse induced by the 2008 credit crisis, the five-year price started to come down gradually, while the spot price continued to surge for a while.
They may very well get their wish.
During the 1990’s, holding shares of firms with no or few entrenching provisions, and shorting shares of firms with many such provisions, would have outperformed the market.
We found evidence that, by 2001, markets learned to appreciate the difference between good-governance and bad-governance firms in terms of their expected future profitability.
Lowering entrenchment levels, rather than trading on them, continues to offer opportunities for substantial returns to firms’ shareholders.
On this day, daughters, wives, and girlfriends give presents to Russian men and lavish them with attention.
According to FOM, 51% of Russians support abolishing conscription, and 67% are against extending the age of eligibility for the draft.
Obligatory military service is inefficient, because “free” conscript labor is much cheaper for the Russian military than hiring civilians as, for example, cooks and cleaning personnel.

एकीकृत दृष्टिकोण का विकास करने के लिए दुनिया के नेताओं के पास तीन महत्वपूर्ण अवसर होंगे। जुलाई में, संयुक्त राष्ट्र अदीस अबाबा, इथियोपिया में विकास के लिए वित्त-पोषण पर सम्मेलन आयोजित करेगा। सितंबर में, संयुक्त राष्ट्र महासभा स्थायी विकास लक्ष्यों (एसडीजी) को प्रारंभ करने के लिए कार्यक्रम आयोजित करेगी। और दिसंबर में, दुनिया भर के नेता जलवायु परिवर्तन पर संयुक्त राष्ट्र फ़्रेमवर्क समझौते के प���्षों के 21वें सम्मेलन (सीओपी 21) में भाग लेंगे, जहाँ उनके ग्रीनहाउस गैस उत्सर्जनों की दीर्घावधि कमी पर बाध्यकारी वैश्विक समझौते को स्वीकार करने की आशा है।
विकास परियोजनाओं का वित्त-पोषण करने के लिए पर्याप्त पूँजी आकर्षित करने के लिए दुर्लभ आधिकारिक सहायता का लाभ उठाने के लिए, बहुपक्षीय विकास बैंक (एमडीबी) पहले ही अलग-अलग और सामूहिक रूप से मदद कर रहे हैं। वास्तव में, उनका वित्तीय लाभ उनके ढाँचे में निर्मित है: वे मौलिक रूप से वित्तीय संस्थाएँ हैं, जिन्हें कुशलता से प्रदत्त पूँजी की छोटी राशियों से वित्त-पोषित किया गया है जो शेयरधारकों द्वारा प्रतिदेय पूँजी से समर्थित हैं।
Africa’s development challenges are well known.
The rebirth of Africa’s private sector – a critical missing ingredient in past development efforts – has played a significant role in driving this performance, and it can fill the investment gap while generating returns in the process.
But taking advantage of this opportunity requires a new approach to private financing of Africa’s development, in which Africa is the lead investor in its own economic renaissance.
Indeed, without profound structural change, the favorable standard of living that underpins the Gulf states’ political stability is likely to erode.
Wealthy locals, for example, could be given incentives to invest in start-ups, while the government could provide low-interest loans and defer repayment until a particular profit threshold is reached.
International institutions could help by offering technical assistance.
The fundamental problem with the patent system is simple: it is based on restricting the use of knowledge.
But the cost to society was enormous: the high price that Myriad, the patent holder, places on genetic tests (between $3,000 and $4,000) may well mean that thousands of women who would otherwise have been tested, discovered that they were at risk, and taken appropriate remediation, will die instead.
A prize fund would work well in areas in which needs are well known – the case for many diseases afflicting the poor – allowing clear goals to be set in advance.
But the real worry is not the risk associated with near-term challenges, like Japan’s return to recession in 2014 or the eurozone’s enduring sluggishness; it is the gale-force headwinds that the entire world will face over the next half-century.
But, as fertility declines and populations age, the labor engine’s contribution to growth will fall sharply, to little more than 0.3 percentage points of annual growth.
These changes, while important, would have a limited impact, lifting labor’s contribution to future growth from one-fifth to only one-third of post-war levels.
Because the biggest opportunities lie in spurring faster productivity catch-up by adopting and diffusing today’s best practices, politicians must keep pushing to reduce trade and regulatory barriers to market integration and competition.
This was down from 1% in 1996-2006 and 0.5% in the crisis years of 2007-2012.
One view, popular among economic historians, is that it takes time for the productivity-enhancing effects of new technologies to show up.
Employment of prime-age males should be rising, not falling.
They are delivering less patient care as they spend more time hunched over their laptops, inputting data that add nothing, currently, to their productivity.
The theoretical debate could continue indefinitely.
After all, a short-sighted approach not only undermines companies’ prospects; it also threatens the entire economy.
In doing so, such companies offer a powerful response to the question of what their role in society should be. More important, they are showing the rest of the corporate sector that the business of advancing the common good is a worthy one.
Despite the demonstrated benefits of broad-based profit-sharing programs, only about one-third of US private-sector workers participate in them, and about 20% own stock in their companies.
Promisingly, the United Automobile Workers union recently announced that, as it continues to push for collective bargaining rights, it is also cooperating with management to form a works council in the German-owned Volkswagen plant in Tennessee.
Spurred partly by this tax incentive, corporations have shifted top executives’ compensation toward shares, options, and other forms of profit sharing and stock ownership, largely leaving out regular workers.
NEW YORK – In theory, it is hard to think of any nobler computer service than the typical “Help Wanted” board.
To my surprise, there are about 100,000 certified life coaches in the United States these days.
I asked her: “Is it just me, or do juries really rise to the challenge?” She replied: “Only twice in my career have I disagreed with the verdict of my jury.”
Do they try harder under pressure, or do they quit in the face of difficulty?
It remains unclear how effective this will be, but I’m betting on it.
The fiscal and economic arguments for a more liberal approach to migration have shaped the American debate.
One million people relocated to Germany in 2012 alone.
Other countries have also gotten on the reform bandwagon.
The first such summit, in 2006, gave birth to an important new institution, the Global Forum on Migration and Development.
There is no shortage of problems to confront and opportunities to seize.
This progress is all the more important given the complacency that led to a complete standstill in research and development for new TB interventions toward the end of the twentieth century.
The bad news is that infected individuals carry the agent with them for their entire lives.
While this additional cost can be borne by health-care systems in the rich world, it is excessive for poor countries, implying no, or insufficient, treatment.
We still have a long way to go, and accelerated R&D to develop new drugs and vaccines can be achieved only with increased funding.
Sustainable Development Economics
After all, most politicians love to spend money they don’t have.
Unless the public sector invests, and invests wisely, the private sector will continue to hoard its funds or return them to shareholders in the forms of dividends or buybacks.
Business investment without infrastructure and human capital cannot be profitable.
Free-market ideologues claim that governments are incapable of productive investment.
The US has no such institution, or indeed any agency that looks systematically at public-investment strategies.
This enthusiasm for reform marks a paradigm shift.
Support should be raised tenfold or even more to make a real impact.
Working with moderate Arab states, we can create a new regional security regime for the Greater Middle East, modeled on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In Europe, the Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs and the High Representative on External Affairs are boosting Europe's ability to tackle new threats.
Big losses for large depositors in Cypriot banks will now be imposed, and the country’s second-largest bank will be shuttered.
In fact, in the search for an acceptable bailout package, the future revenues from these assets were at one point considered as possible guarantees.
Anastasiades, a member of the pro-European Dimokratikós Sinayermós (Democratic Rally) party, won 57% of the popular vote on a platform that emphasized economic recovery, and this will naturally be his top priority.
And the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Öcalan’s recent call for a ceasefire is an encouraging sign that Turkey, too, stands to benefit from a peace dividend.
Namun dalam beberapa dekade saja, seperempat jenis hiu dan pari terancam punah.
Timbul persoalan buruk lainnya di luar ZEE: sebagian besar sumber daya hayati secara de facto bersifat terbuka sehingga menjadikan mereka rentan terhadap eksploitasi berlebihan.
Satu langkah yang memberi harapan, hasil rekomendasi kelompok kerja di PBB pada bulan Januari, adalah perumusan perjanjian baru yang mengikat secara hukum tentang keanekaragaman hayati di laut lepas yang saat ini tengah dipersiapkan untuk tinjauan di hadapan Majelis Umum PBB pada bulan September yang akan datang.
Perjanjian berikutnya mengenai “keanekaragaman hayati di luar wilayah jurisdiksi nasional”, yang didasarkan pada cara-cara terbaru untuk memantau kepatuhan, dapat meningkatkan pengelolaan laut dengan pesat.
The war has claimed more than 200,000 lives and devastated Syria’s social and economic fabric.
A comprehensive resolution of the conflict is urgently needed.
This not only flies in the face of morality; it is also counterproductive.
Taking Safety Littorally
The list goes on.
In Hilo, Hawaii, after devastating tsunamis struck in 1946, 1960, and 1964, the vulnerable area near the city was declared a municipal park, where no structures were allowed to be built.
In order to protect the local economy further, beaches should be repaired after major storms through “beach nourishment” (replacement of lost sand from external sources).
In addition, construction in coastal areas damaged by extreme events could be prohibited, as has been done in Hilo, Hawaii.
When it is absent or deficient, the loss of life and livelihoods can be horrific – witness Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged Haiti and New Orleans in 2005.
Redundancy is the key.&#160;
Admittedly, the impact of natural disasters is less systemic; but if a calamity takes out key components of networks that lack redundancy and backup, the effects are similar.
Another line of reasoning is that businesses that depend heavily on continuity – for example, hospitals, outsourcing firms in India, and stock exchanges – will invest in their own backup systems.
Hubs that lack resilience create cascades of collateral damage when they fail.
In the case of Zimbabwe, it is extremely difficult to obtain such information.
Once again, the African Union, with the support of the UN, should provide the leadership that would demonstrate that Africa has the capacity and the will to resolve a great crisis in a manner that mitigates the suffering of African people.
It continued last year when the Bush administration, recognizing that it had no policies to boost employment, explored whether China's undervalued exchange rate might be blamed for closed factories in Ohio.
The fall over the past three years in the proportion of the working-age population with jobs in America has been the biggest in percentage terms since the Great Depression.
The 21st century will see the world constantly at war against terrorism.
As it happened, we wiped the floor with them, winning by an unprecedented margin of 80% to 20%.
This claim has great credibility with labor unions that believe that trade with poor countries produces paupers in rich countries.
Even if other economies are closed, open economies still profit from their own free trade.
This scare arose during Senator John Kerry’s failed presidential campaign in 2004, when digitized x-rays were sent from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston to be read in India.
The court accepted that the government may require factually accurate health warnings, but the majority, in a split decision, said that it could not go as far as requiring images.
Cigarettes are also highly addictive.
Mill could have accepted requirements for health warnings on cigarette packs, and even graphic photos of diseased lungs if that helps people to understand the choice that they are making; but he would have rejected a ban.
MILAN – The world is facing the prospect of an extended period of weak economic growth.
Though the US is finally emerging from an extended period in which potential output exceeded demand, high unemployment continues to suppress demand in Europe.
The notable exception is China, which has maintained high (and occasionally perhaps excessive) levels of public investment throughout the post-crisis period.
At the same time, this approach means that policymakers must find ways to ensure that public investments provide returns for private investors.
President Barack Obama relied on that power when he told both Congress and the American people that he had the authority to order limited strikes on Syria without going to Congress.
Moreover, diplomacy thrives on back-room deals of the kind that US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have just struck over Syria’s chemical weapons.
These arguments do not mean that leaders will not use force from time to time without turning to their people first. Obama does have constitutional authority to conduct limited military strikes to deter and degrade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons.
Most of the pain is deferred, which is precisely why such cuts are politically attractive.
For example, in the face of investor pressure, pharmaceutical companies have cut their research activities dramatically, relying instead on acquisition strategies.
If public and private investment decisions are driven only by the easily measured and easily defined, we will miss out on the breakthrough moments that characterize so much of human achievement and advancement.
But effective programs require more than just money; they need employers and educators who can identify the necessary skills, create the structures to teach them, and match trained workers with available jobs.
For every dollar a student pays or gives up to attend school, his or her future income rises by about $4.80.
That program is now operating at 163 colleges and institutes.
AT&amp;T offers scholarships through partner non-profit institutions and provides paid internships for up to 100 graduates.
वाशिंग्टन, डी सी - वैश्विक असमानता में भारी वृद्धि और आय वितरण के एकदम शीर्ष पर धन के संकेंद्रण को संचालित करने वाले कारकों में से एक कारक नवाचार और वैश्विक बाज़ारों के बीच पारस्परिक प्रभाव है। सक्षम उद्यमी के हाथों में प्रौद्योगिकी सफलता अरबों डॉलर के बराबर हो सकती है, जिसका कारण विनियामक संरक्षण और वैश्विक बाज़ारों की, विजेता-सब-कुछ-ले-जाए की प्रकृति होना है। तथापि, जिस बात की अकसर अनदेखी की जाती है, वह जनता के पैसे द्वारा निजी धन के इस आधुनिक संकेंद्रण में निभाई जाने वाली भूमिका है।
इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि निजी उद्यमियों की कल्पना, मार्केटिंग की जानकारी, और प्रबंधन कौशल नई प्रौद्योगिकी को सफल रूप में लागू किए जाने के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं। और अनेक नवाचारों के वाणिज्यीकरण द्वारा पेश की जाने वाली कम क़ीमतें, बेहतर उत्पाद, और उपभोक्ता की बचत स्पष्ट रूप से बड़े सामाजिक लाभ प्रदान करते हैं। लेकिन हमें इन सफलताओं में सरकार की भूमिका को नज़रअंदाज़ नहीं करना चाहिए।
बहुत अधिक प्रतिभा को जुटाने के लिए भारी मात्रा में प्रतिलाभ की ज़रूरत नहीं होती; ख़ास तौर से अच्छी उद्यमशीलता के लिए कुछ सालों तक 50% लाभ जैसा मार्जिन स्वीकार्य लाभ होगा। तथापि, उस राशि का कई गुना बस कुछ व्यक्तियों को जनता द्वारा दिए गए तोहफ़े जैसा बनकर रह जाता है। ऐसे उपायों और अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समझौतों के संयोजन जैसा कोई उपाय ढूँढ़ा जा सकता है जिससे करदाताओं को, जानकार उद्यमियों के लिए अभिनव उत्पादों को वाणिज्यिक बनाने के प्रोत्साहनों को हटाए बिना, अपने निवेश पर अच्छे प्रतिलाभ मिल सकते हों।
But, as requirements for registering clinical trials have become more stringent, its magnitude has become quantifiable: the results of at least half of the clinical trials involving patients and healthy volunteers remain unpublished years after completion.
It is widely acknowledged that the high current level of investment in pharmaceutical research is yielding too few substantive discoveries.
Publication is a moral imperative.
Then, crisis erupted in May, when the country ran low on foreign-currency reserves and traders could not purchase the dollars they needed.

The IMF should not be in the ransom business.
The resulting fiscal austerity plunged many below the poverty line and accelerated economic inequality, while many private institutions, having caused the 2008 bust, recovered on the public dime.
The refusal of today’s elites to promote an effective balance of the three powers – to recognize a larger purpose beyond maximizing each individual power – has visibly translated into a waning regard for the public good.
The push toward such a space needs to be spearheaded by risk takers – social and political entrepreneurs who are unafraid to work across lines traditionally dividing sectors and states, and who help to re-create a global community of purpose beyond power.
After twelve years of transition, the answer to the first question has blurred.
Autocracy, not dictatorship.
Welcome to the republic.
The emergence of viable political parties requires a strong parliament.
The reformist "Union of Right Forces," led by Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais, destroyed itself last December, failing to gain a seat in the Duma.
But the French have an older word for Putinism: étatisme , which holds that the state commands society rather than serves it.
Will Russia have to rewrite its laws and Constitution to give the prime minister more official power? Is Putin risking his political future by accepting a formally secondary role and making himself accountable for all socio-economic policy?
Many commentators underestimate the prime minister’s powers.
While not entirely addressing the flaws in the design, the new situation – with the strongest political figure heading the executive branch – will permit more effective performance by the government, which is still battling to recover from Putin’s administrative reforms of 2004.
Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister and now an opposition critic, was inherited from Yeltsin.
The bloodshed in France, however, has changed the calculus completely, pointing toward the possibility of a rapprochement between Russia and the West.
The West has “lied to us many times, made decisions behind our backs, placed before us a fait accompli,” Putin said in a televised address, shortly after a dubious referendum in Crimea cemented Russia’s control over the region.
Russia has achieved its objective in Ukraine: a frozen conflict that will provide the Kremlin a continuous role in the country’s politics.
Russia’s participation in the battle against the Islamic State – and its return to the rule-abiding ranks of the international community – may be worth the price.
As a result, whereas Hungary pays Gazprom $260 per thousand cubic meters of gas, Poland pays $526 – the highest price in the EU.
In essence, the decision sent the same message as the EU’s anti-trust action against Gazprom: rules apply to everyone, and stolen property must be returned.
Putin Made Simple
Multiple higher courts were too difficult to maintain, so a single court replaced them.
The destruction of democratic institutions was now being driven both by the desire for simplicity and by pure greed.
Unfortunately, such a scenario seems farfetched.
But the plain truth is that neither the BRICS nor the SCO is remotely close to being a cohesive bloc capable of insulating Russia from the consequences of its behavior in Ukraine.
That, in a nutshell, was the Soviet model, which failed once and would fail again.
On the other hand, with the help of the military-industrial KGB complex – the “ siloviki ” – he has systematically weakened or destroyed every check on his personal power, while strengthening the state’s ability to violate citizens’ constitutional rights.
Like their president, most Russians see no contradiction between improving their personal lives and the country’s international status since the 1990’s and the erosion of democratic institutions.
What could be more democratic?
Like other democratic leaders, he might consider working in the private-sector, like Gerhard Schröder, or, better yet, write books and help Tsunami victims, like Bill Clinton or become an environmentalist, like Mikhail Gorbachev.
Back then, the US encouraged Islam as a bulwark against communism.
Russia’s other aim has been to exempt from UN sanctions the Bushehr nuclear reactor that it has been building for Iran.
A nuclear-armed Iran on its doorstep is certainly not in Russia’s national interest, particularly given the increasing radicalization of Russia’s own 20 million Muslim citizens – the only part of its population that is actually growing.
For starters, it is based on the claim that, at the time of the Berlin Wall’s collapse and the Soviet Union’s disintegration, the West promised that there would be no NATO expansion. Even Mikhail Gorbachev, on the 25th anniversary of the Wall’s demise, accused the West of not keeping the promises it made in 1989, instead taking “advantage of Russia’s weakening” in the 1990s to claim “monopoly leadership and domination of the world,” including through NATO enlargement.
The next year, the financial crisis struck, convincing Putin that his assessment had been prophetic. The crisis, in his view, was proof that the days of American global dominance were over.
While Western politicians and economic policymakers were trying to avert Great Depression II, Putin was already working on the assumption that it had arrived. For the West, managing the resulting geopolitical imbroglio will be even more challenging than repairing its damaged economies.
The regime and the public now see the current situation as more or less normal – a “non-crisis crisis.”
The consequence is a country divided between loyal and disloyal, patriotic and unpatriotic – that is, between those who toe the party line and those who refuse.
The stagnation will probably last into the following political cycle, too.
This recalls the American political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski’s observation in the 1950s that totalitarian regimes (in contrast to authoritarian ones) impose both prohibitions and imperatives on citizens.
Perhaps most blatant, the Russian state under Putin compels citizens’ political mobilization, by interpreting non-participation as resistance to the regime. In this context, Hirschman’s “exit” option – at least in the form of “inner emigration” – may not be as readily available as it might seem; it would, after all, be easy to construe such a move as resistance.
The restaurant had many of the traits found in ethnic restaurants everywhere.
The White Sun existed in Soviet times.
But the main attraction is a shooting gallery where patrons can test their skills between courses.
As a special honor, his Russian hosts organized an excursion to Strelna, the “Russian Versailles,” which was recently restored from ruin to become the Petersburg residence of President Vladimir Putin.
Like the customers in that Ukrainian-style village restaurant, perhaps Putin found his attic ark reassuring in some unconscious way.
The contrast with its benign policy toward Libya in 2011 reflects how Russian foreign policy changed with the return of Vladimir Putin to the Kremlin.
If Russia were serious about economic integration, it would promote free-trade agreements to facilitate trade in all directions.
In early 2009, when Gazprom could not sell all of its gas to Europe because of the Great Recession, it sought to cut its supplies from Central Asia.
On his way to the Crimea, however, Putin encountered a notorious Russian nationalist motorcycle gang, whose members demand that the Crimea be transferred to Russia.
The CSTO remains a paper alliance without military significance.
Unlike the fracas over an American missile shield in Europe, this conflict shows no signs of blowing over, and threatens to damage further the rocky relationship between Russia and the West.    
Now, at the eleventh hour, Russia is sticking to its obstructionist position, and its presidential election in March will likely reinforce anti-Western postures.
A declaration of independence by Kosovo will likely bring a similar declaration from Georgia’s breakaway Abkhazia region, which Russia could well recognize.
In the case of Abkhazia, the West should reiterate the sui generis nature of Kosovo and highlight the tremendous efforts it has undertaken there since 1999.
But that continuity is more reminiscent of the zastoi, or stagnation, of the Brezhnev era.
Instead, the state is the target of political entrepreneurs who strive to capture it in order to capture the rents that it controls.
As a proportion of GDP, it has been halved since the early 1990’s, and is now just 1% of GDP.
“meaningful reforms look highly unlikely – for the simple reason that they would harm the interests of Russia’s ruling elites.
Instead, the Russian people have now challenged the status quo.
Such a change would be doubly beneficial: it would both enhance trade and hold to account people responsible for egregious human-rights abuses.
Imposing travel sanctions on suspected human-rights abusers is a sensible and practical way forward.
For example, Putin recently abolished elections in Russia’s provinces.
Their national independence is now more elusive than it was before the terrorist era began.
Their common interest is continuation of the game.
Call this the “Asef” effect.
Abolishing democracy in Russia’s provinces, including Muslim-populated regions such as Tatarstan and Dagestan, is a deadly act.
In 1991, the Soviet Union –&nbsp;then seemingly an unbreakable monolith – collapsed in just a few months.
History debunks Putin’s myth that the majority of the country supports him because they want “stability,” and that the protests, headed by “Western stooges,” are about to subside.
Their personal interests, and riches, are too dependent on maintaining the status quo.
When he left the Kremlin in 2000, his secret fortune, from real estate, yachts, horses, and other properties, was estimated to be worth at least $15 million.
Second, Putin cannot stand Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who admittedly is not an easy man to like.
Where is NATO’s front line?
But you can forget about seeing that.
Yet it looks suspiciously as though the deal that ended the fighting will leave Russian troops in that truncated country for years.
Europe's approach is weak and will cause bigger problems in the future. So Putin wins the gold medal in his favorite event - bullying his smaller neighbors.
They also see this victory as the main counter-weight to the memory of the USSR as a reign of brutal, unjustified violence.
Instead, he includes all citizens of the USSR who died during the war, including millions of Ukrainians, Belarusians, and others.
Molotov, who remained in power throughout the war and until 1956, denied the existence of the Secret Protocols until his death 30 years later.
No price is too high to achieve that end, so traditional threats about dividing Ukraine have been used.
Arm some of these manufactured minority structures so that they can demand autonomy at the barrel of a gun, and you get the kind of chaos the Kremlin can use to reassert its control.
Proximity to this lawless territory has helped make Moldova the poorest land in Europe.
The first step is to make Russia honor its binding commitment to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as to the Council of Europe, to remove its troops from Moldova and Georgia.
Moreover, Putin’s Kremlin has used the West –&nbsp;eager for engagement and a policy “reset” with Russia – to legitimize its authoritarian rule and to provide opportunities for its venal cronies’ integration into Western society.
In this way, Putin’s regime intensifies political dissenters’ longing for retaliation – thereby hindering peaceful change.
The longer Putin remains in power, the more devastating his regime’s final act will be.
But, this August, the crisis was purely man-made –&nbsp;indeed, made by one man.
A third, Yekaterina Samutsevich, followed them to prison 12 days later.
They repeated ad nauseam that the cathedral was constructed as a monument to the victory over Napoleon, the 200th anniversary of which is being commemorated this year.
The political character of the performance was studiously ignored, and the verdict of the judge, who sentenced the trio to two years in prison, proved to be the show trial’s scandalous dénouement.
Over the same period, the population of the United States has grown from 248 million to more than 300 million.
(Putin is courting the other ex-Soviet Central Asian countries, as well as Ukraine and Georgia).
His presence is an embarrassment to NATO, but an even greater disgrace for Russia.
It is all the more important that we remember this today, because these threats are not becoming fewer, but are only transforming and changing their appearance.
The primary purpose of Russia’s foreign policy seems to be to tap Russia’s state companies for the benefit of Kremlin officials.
Russia’s nationalists are also outraged by Putin’s foreign policy, because it has alienated former Soviet republics and weakened Russia’s military.
Putin\u0027s Puppies and Russian Democracy
Countries with per capita incomes close to the current Russian level sustain democracy for 15-20 years on average. Russian democracy, born in 1991, may be nearing its expiration date.
The population is declining, but immigration is blocked for ideological reasons.
In the late 1980's, Mikhail Gorbachev announced that Russian oil was practically exhausted.
You cannot deceive people about growth; they feel the weight of their pockets better than anyone else.
Their profession has become so important in recent years that there is now a special "Day of the Political Consultant" in Russia every February 25.
Or is the system simply that of a conniving authoritarian? This view is already conventional wisdom, not only in America, but in Europe as well.
So who is responsible for the fact that liberal democracy has ended in Russia? Well, Putin, of course, and Yeltsin before him.
Under the current soft authoritarian regime, I can see only one rather negative scenario for the future: authentic, full-fledged dictatorship.
He will and he won’t.
Moreover, he appears to believe that confrontations between the state and civil society are counterproductive.
More broadly, as the head of Putin’s presidential administration, Medvedev directly oversaw the construction of today’s authoritarian system of Russian governance.
What if Putin is wrong in his choice of successor, and Medvedev refuses to be his clone, but instead follows in the footsteps of Khrushchev, Gorbachev, and Yeltsin? What if the supposed puppet starts to pull the strings?
Russians should be demanding a solution to their country’s economic troubles, not praising the leader who caused them.
If Russian businesspeople repatriate their offshore accounts, their financial indiscretions will be forgiven and forgotten.
Of course, it is not the tycoons who will bear the brunt of the economic crisis.
They still do.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin’s main European interlocutor, has been expressing her frustration with Russian policy toward Ukraine in increasingly harsh terms.
Likewise, though establishing a Confucius Institute in Manila to teach Filipino people about Chinese culture may help to cultivate China’s soft power, its impact will be severely constrained if China is simultaneously using its hard power to bully the Philippines in the territorial dispute over the Scarborough Shoal.
Instead, even as the Games were proceeding, Putin launched a semi-covert military intervention in Ukraine, which, together with his talk of Russian nationalism, has induced severe anxiety, particularly among ex-Soviet countries.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the BBC retains its credibility because it can bite the government hand that feeds it.
It also played a critical role in the collapse of communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. And it certainly contributed to the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych – a key Putin ally – in 2014.
Meanwhile, Russian oligarchs have been purchasing European newspapers, including The Independent, The Evening Standard, and France-Soir.
Unfortunately, the European establishment is not doing enough to counter Moscow’s anti-European, divide-and-rule offensive.
But opportunism is not ideological affinity.
Given Putinism’s uncertain ideological roots, this turn toward Russia might seem puzzling.
(Similarly, Mussolini was filmed bare-chested, harvesting corn.)
Having been born in the early 1960’s, my generation remembers two crises.

There is a good reason for this docility.
Don’t worry, Russia’s oligarchs are not starving, but the fortunes of many of them have collapsed.
Fortunately, Russians know how to survive hard times.
But, while he refuses to spell out his plans for remaining in power once his second term expires next spring, his economic policy is clear.
His only “mass” meeting in Moscow drew no more than 5,000 people.
Personal authoritarianism rarely survives its founder.
Although corruption has been declining in most of the former Soviet Union, it has surged in Russia since 2004, becoming more rationalized and concentrated. None of Putin’s KGB kingpins has been arrested or even demoted.
Monetary policy has been loose for the last year, and before the Duma election the government started pouring huge sums into pensions and other social welfare transfers.
In general, each one represents a task – something to read, a query to answer, a meeting to schedule, a bill to pay, a request to fulfill or deny, even a friend’s post to like.
But there is another way: The sender figures out what matters, and puts money behind that choice.
Isn’t it unfair to cut off access? Does it restrict freedom of speech?
Over time, a variety of specialist service providers will emerge – single-topic experts and general mail managers.
As for consumer customers, most companies already make you pay by filling in an annoying form that asks you for a bunch of irrelevant items before you can send a help request. They will probably keep that feature, and add a $10 e-mail hotline address.
Yet there are 2.8 billion people under the age of 25 out of a world population of six billion.
One thing is certain: old solutions to old problems won't work.
The Sarajevo conference is a step in the right direction.
Using its vast resources, and driven by unbridled ambition, Qatar has emerged as a hub for radical Islamist movements.
Qatar hosts Al Udeid air base – with its 8,000 American military personnel and 120 aircraft, including supertankers for in-flight refueling – from which the US directs its current airstrikes in Syria and Iraq.
This competitive dynamic, which surfaced only recently, represents a shift from a long history of working in tandem to export Islamist extremism.
Qatar’s leaders are willing to challenge their neighbors for a simple reason: They believe that the grassroots Islamist movements they support – which, in their view, represent majority political aspirations – eventually will win.
It hosts Israeli spokespersons and embraces state-of-the-art broadcasting techniques.
Simply put, the Al Jazeera success story would not have been possible without Qatar’s backing.
So, while the Arab Spring has been a genuine popular uprising against decades of corrupt and oppressive authoritarian regimes, its rapid spread, which caught almost everyone by surprise, was due in part to the influence of Al Jazeera, which became the voice of the voiceless throughout the Middle East.
BEIJING – It is a story that has played out worldwide.
The McKinsey Global Institute projects that new Web applications could enable as much as 22% of China’s total GDP growth through 2025.
Though China’s government established preliminary rules governing online privacy in 2012, many gray areas remain, including basic issues like the types of information companies can share, how that information can be used, and what constitutes consumer consent.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in banks’ current scramble to defend their territory from online financial-services providers.
Others, especially on the political right, worried that the latest monetary measures would fuel future inflation and encourage unbridled government spending.
Monetary policy has proven ineffective, and more of it is unlikely to return the economy to sustainable growth.
But most of the wealthy know that temporary measures result only in a fleeting blip in stock prices – hardly enough to support a consumption splurge.
To allay anxiety about government profligacy, the ECB built conditionality into its bond-purchase program.
CAMBRIDGE – There is no doubt that the American economy rallied strongly at the end of 2010.
Real personal consumer spending grew at a robust 4.4% rate, as spending on consumer durables soared by 21%.
To be sure, there is no proof that QE2 led to the stock-market rise, or that the stock-market rise caused the increase in consumer spending.
Without that increase in stock-market wealth, will the saving rate continue to decline and the pace of consumer spending continue to rise more rapidly than GDP?
But, intended or not, the increased supply of dollars also affects the international value of the dollar.
The Chinese government, acting through the People’s Bank of China, determines the renminbi’s exchange rate.
But it is clear that the fall of the renminbi against other currencies that has resulted from the Fed’s policy of quantitative easing now gives the Chinese scope for more rapid appreciation of the renminbi relative to the dollar.
“Monetary policy's power is limited, particularly when the interest rate is so low," some said.
Japan, by contrast, hesitated to expand its money supply substantially, leaving the yen's exchange rate against the US dollar to appreciate to 76 (from less than 100 before the Lehman crisis), and causing GDP growth to decline further.
After nearly two decades of recession, the Japanese economy was growing again – and it had Abenomics to thank for it.
At last year's World Knowledge Forum, several leading central bankers – including former BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, and former Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong-soo – also dismissed the potential of unconventional monetary policy.
But, in an economy where debt has exploded to more than 200% of GDP, it is not easy to rein in growth gradually without triggering widespread failure of ambitious investment projects.
Of course, Chinese growth almost surely fluctuates far more than the official numbers reveal, in part because local officials have incentives to smooth the data that they report to the central authorities.
Unfortunately, China’s data are not nearly as reliable as those measuring a developed economy, which makes it difficult for anyone to be sure of what is happening.
The potential vulnerability of Western exports and equity prices is massive.
How credible will an anti-corruption message be when delivered by an appointee of what is considered one of the most corrupt and incompetent administrations in US history?
When our research showed that certain policies (like agricultural subsidies) were hurting developing countries, we publicized the findings, helping to redefine the debate.
Do you think countries that are corrupt should be cut off from funding? If so, will do you so in a consistent way?
It has done enough damage.
Indeed, the regime welcomed George W. Bush and his neo-con administration, because it allowed Iran’s leaders to close ranks, and at the same time delivered free access to influence in Iraq and Afghanistan.
One of the first successful revolutions of this kind, and certainly the most important, took place in China in 1949.
In the long run, though, rule by bayonet rarely works.
As a result, Turkey, not Iran, is on track to become this century’s key Middle Eastern power.
He also cancelled the debts of some small producers and raised the prices paid by the state for milk and meat.
Cuba’s government argues that America’s financial and political support for the opposition impedes that.
Shortages of medicines and basic foodstuffs such as milk, sugar, eggs, beef, and chicken abound as a consequence of price controls and mounting inflation.
Raúl replaced Fidel as President of the Councils of Ministers and of State, but not as First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party.
Accepting a Cuban exception would represent an enormous setback.
Race and Republicanism
Indeed, many argue that by refusing to take into account distinctions linked to ethnic and religious origin, these distinctions are legitimized.
But government statisticians have long been studying the national origins of immigrants, and are permitted to indicate the previous nationality of people who have acquired French citizenship.
The ban against ethnic and racial data is a taboo that should not be overthrown easily, and not without carefully weighing the risk to social peace.
Obama is consistently criticized for his “otherness” and his “arrogance,” terms that call to mind the image of the “uppity nigger” from the days of segregation, which are actually not so far in America’s past.
But his continuing difficulties with white working-class voters, who in the primaries went with Hillary Clinton, suggest that, perhaps, the “Bradley effect” is still alive and well.
Whether or not her judgment carries a racist undertone, as many observers believe, the polls indicate that many Americans agree.
Marxist ideology had become all but a façade; not even party apparatchiks pretended to believe it.
Exhausted, the Polish Communist regime agreed to sit down to talks with Solidarity.
Once a peripheral European country economically and politically, Poland has become one of Europe’s leading states and a co-shaper of its future.
His place in the history books is guaranteed.
It is more often an act of war, albeit war by the weak rather than by organized states and their armies.
Since 2011, the CIA and US allies have poured in weapons, finance, and training in an attempt to topple President Bashar al-Assad.
The terrorists themselves cast their actions in political terms, even though we rarely listen; indeed, the terrorists’ words are typically reported only briefly, if at all.
The UK no longer needs to protect its trade routes to colonial India, and the US no longer needs a ring of military bases to contain the Soviet Union.
पर्यावरण और विकास संबंधी ढाँचों को परस्पर मिलाना एक अच्छा विचार है - यह जलवायु की रक्षा, जैव-विविधता के संरक्षण, मानव अधिकारों को बनाए रखने, और गरीबी को कम करने के लिए संयुक्त राष्ट्र के तत्वावधान में तैयार किए गए कानूनी तौर पर बाध्यकारी अनेक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सम्मेलनों और समझौतों की सफलता पर आधारित होता है। हालाँकि वे संभवतः परिपूर्ण नहीं होते हैं - और, दुर्भाग्यवश, जो देश उनकी पुष्टि करते हैं वे हमेशा लक्ष्य हासिल नहीं करते है - उनसे ऐसी संस्थागत प्रक्रियाओं के निर्माण का मार्ग प्रशस्त हुआ है जिनसे देश अपने वादों को पूरा करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित होते हैं और नागरिक सरकारों को जवाबदेह ठहराने के लिए प्रोत्साहित होते हैं।

मुंबई - जब विश्व वैश्विक आर्थिक संकट से उबरने के लिए जूझ रहा है, तो लगता है कि कई उन्नत देशों ने इसके परिप्रेक्ष्य में जो अपरंपरागत मौद्रिक नीतियाँ अपनाईं, उन्हें व्यापक स्वीकृति मिली है। परंतु जिन अर्थव्यवस्थाओं में ऋण का भार बहुत अधिक है, नीति अनिश्चित है, या ढाँचागत सुधार की आवश्यकता के कारण घरेलू माँग में बाधा उत्पन्न होती है, उनके मामले में यह प्रश्न उचित है कि क्या इन नीतियों के घरेलू लाभ अन्य अर्थव्यवस्थाओं को हुए हानिकारक अतिप्रवाह से ज़्यादा हैं।
इसी तर्ज़ पर, देशों के लिए यह जायज़ हो जाएगा कि वे उसे अपनाएँ जिसे वे “परिमाणात्मक बाह्य सहजता” (QEE) कह सकते हैं, जिसमें केंद्रीय बैंक भारी प्रारक्षित निधियों का निर्माण करते हुए, अपनी विनिमय दरों को कम रखने के लिए हस्तक्षेप कर सकते हैं। यदि शुद्ध अतिप्रवाह अंतर्राष्ट्रीय रूप से स्वीकार्य नीति का निर्धारण नहीं करते, तो बहुपक्षीय संस्थाएँ यह दावा नहीं कर सकती हैं कि परिमाणात्मक बाह्य सहजता (QEE) से खेल के नियमों का उल्लंघन होता है, चाहे इससे कितनी भी अस्थिरता का ख़तरा क्यों न होता हो।

पिछले दो दशकों में, एचआईवी, तपेदिक और मलेरिया का मुकाबला करने में आश्चर्यजनक सफलता मिली है। अफ़्रीका में कुछ देशों में नए एचआईवी संक्रमणों में 50% जितनी अधिक तक की कमी हुई है, एड्स-संबंधी रोगों के मामले में मौतों की संख्या में 30-48% तक की कमी हुई है; तपेदिक के मामलों में 40% तक की कमी हुई है, और मलेरिया के मामलों में 30% तक की कमी हुई है।
लेकिन यदि भुखमरी की लगात पर विचार किया जाए तो यह लागत उतनी अधिक चुनौतीपूर्ण नहीं लगती है। यूनिसेफ के अनुमान के अनुसार अफ़्रीका के बाल कुपोषण की लागत $25 बिलियन प्रति वर्ष है। और यह पूरी कहानी नहीं है। कुपोषण के कारण उत्पादकता की हानि और स्वास्थ्य देखभाल की उच्च लागतों के फलस्वरूप वैश्विक अर्थव्यवस्था पर अनुमानतः $3.5 ट्रिलियन प्रति वर्ष की लागत आती है।
कुपोषण जीवन के पहले पाँच हज़ार दिनों के दौरान सबसे अधिक क्षति पहुँचाता है जिसके फलस्वरूप शिशुओं के स्वास्थ्य पर गंभीर और अपरिवर्तनीय परिवर्तन होते हैं। अदृश्य भुखमरी के मामले में सचमुच सफलता पाने के लिए अफ़्रीका की सरकारों को वैश्विक विकास के साझेदारों की मदद से शीघ्रतापूर्वक कार्रवाई करनी चाहिए। अफ़्रीका में बाल भुखमरी के जानलेवा होने के लिए उसका उतना अधिक प्रभावशाली होना ज़रूरी नहीं है जितना कि कार्टर के 1993 के चित्र में दर्शाया गया है।
In many cases, the importance of ratings comes partly from legal requirements that oblige or encourage institutional investors and investment vehicles to maintain portfolios of assets that have received sufficiently high grades from the recognized agencies.
This can be done by making raters’ profits depend not on satisfying the issuers that select them, but on performing well for investors.
Standard &amp; Poor argued that such a mechanism would provide credit rating agencies with “less incentive to compete with one another, pursue innovation, and improve their models, criteria, and methodologies.”
But the American election’s implications for immigration run deeper than electoral expediency – with lessons for governments around the world.
A recent transatlantic survey by the German Marshall Fund found that, while majorities in all countries were worried about illegal immigration, anxiety about legal immigration was low – with only 26% of European&#160;respondents expressing concern, and just 18% doing so in the United States.
And, in a world in which nearly half of migrants are now moving from one developing country to another, the problems are no longer confined to the West.
This, after all, is what democratic politics is all about.
But the Alliance refused to hold the scheduled meeting following the Georgia crisis.
Already we can name three “growth factors” that will help the new security system to mature – the development of the European Security and Defense Policy, the transformation of NATO, and Russia’s return to its rightful position on the world stage.
The Warsaw Pact ceased to exist 20 years ago, but NATO still proceeds eastward, adding new member states for reasons other than enhancing security and democracy.
A real, working NATO-Russia relationship could provide the Alliance with solutions to problems that it cannot tackle on its own.
Considering them together, my overwhelming thought is that the Friedmans would find their task of justifying and advocating small-government libertarianism much harder today than they did in 1979.
In the United States, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has executed the Friedmanite playbook flawlessly in the current downturn, and it has not been enough to preserve or rapidly restore full employment.
The end of American preeminence in education, the collapse of private-sector unions, the emergence of a winner-take-all information-age economy, and the return of Gilded Age-style high finance have produced an extraordinarily unequal pre-tax distribution of income, which will burden the next generation and make a mockery of equality of opportunity.
Too often, our politicians disparage Europe and impute to it evils (like unemployment) that are really the result of domestic insufficiencies.
A united Europe can respond to these dangers in ways that no single state can.
It is as far from being a controlled economy as it is from resembling the libertarian anarchism that many French opponents of the constitutional treaty fear.
We need founding fathers – or mothers – and nations moved by a clear understanding of their interests and a popular enthusiasm for European integration.
The Dayton Accords of 1995 ended Serb-instigated ethnic cleansing and established peace in Bosnia.
Such assumptions do not inspire confidence. Violence has been the traditional agent of change in the Balkans, and the level of frustration in Bosnia is growing.
·         Support for civil-society groups and democratic parties prior to elections throughout Bosnia this October.
The “reset” of relations with Russia can succeed only if it is reciprocal.
But such a strategy requires that Russia clearly demonstrate its political will to cooperate with NATO. Russia must make a choice.
We must also redefine common threats, while strengthening the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s mechanisms for preventing, managing, and resolving conflicts.
The coming NATO and OSCE summits in Lisbon and Astana offer a unique opportunity to move the Euro-Atlantic alliance and Russia towards an inclusive, cooperative, and effective security community.
There appears to be no single answer. But one common pattern that does emerge is that the jihadi message, because it promises meaning and identity, seems to appeal particularly to people who are unsure about who they are and where they are heading.
The study’s conclusions applied only to Germany, but its main findings were largely corroborated by a Gallup global survey.
But, as protagonists in the complex web of interaction between the Muslim and the Western worlds, they view militant terrorism as their preferred option.
Read China’s Lips
As a result, China surpassed Japan in late 2008 as the largest foreign holder of US financial assets.
With US government debt repayment now in play, the very concept of dollar-based riskless assets is in doubt.
At the same time, it recognizes the need to address these geopolitical tensions.
That could bring its current account into balance – or even into slight deficit – by 2015.
Reaffirming Europe
So a return of economic, social, or political nationalism is simply not an option.
Extending the EU’s area of freedom and democracy, peace, stability, and prosperity, especially throughout south-eastern Europe, is in the interest of every European citizen.
The latter, however, should be ready to share the burden with us.
But, as the European Union ponders what to do, cold realism, not hysterical overreaction, is in order.
The Cold War was an endurance race between two similarly strong rivals, the weaker of which eventually had to give up.
But not only Russia has changed; so has the entire world.
·        a greater EU commitment to Ukraine to safeguard its independence;
The Washington mountain has labored and brought forth less than a mouse.
Instead of a democratic transformation, were the US to withdraw now, the Middle East would face a war of all against all for regional hegemony.
Instead of victory, the goal must be a minimum of stability – and this still seems achievable.
But with appropriate preparation, a regional solution is possible, and, of all the parties involved, Syria is uniquely positioned to help bring it about.
If successful, the bargain should also aim at a total normalization of relations between Iran and the US.
But Iran, too, harbors illusions, including the notion that it can count on support from non-Western countries, or at least from some sort of Islamic caucus.
People remain convinced that next year, or maybe the year after, the prediction will come true.
Iran may be capable of producing sufficient nuclear material to make one or two bombs within the next couple of years, but such activities would inevitably come into the open, because Iran would either have to enrich the uranium under the eyes of IAEA inspectors or expel them, giving the game away.
Do negotiations stand any chance of success with Ahmadinejad as president? The answer is “no” if our objective remains forcing Iran to renounce all activity on centrifugation.
And, because eurozone banks hold a substantial part of their assets in the form of eurozone sovereign bonds, the sovereign-debt crisis became a potential banking crisis, worsened by banks’ other losses, owing, for example, to the collapse of housing prices in Spain.
As long as this internal divergence persists, the euro crisis cannot be fully resolved, because current-account deficits and/or slow growth will continue to stalk the southern European countries, perpetuating worries about sovereign debt and commercial banks.
Reversing the large differential in unit labor costs that has emerged in the euro’s first decade thus requires not only wage restraint and productivity-enhancing reforms in the south, but also higher wage gains in the north.
CAMBRIDGE – As the global economy stabilizes, there is a growing danger that the United States and China will slip back into their pre-crisis economic patterns, placing themselves and the rest of the world at risk.
Nevertheless, there is cause for concern.
In addition to tighter credit, falling home prices and high unemployment will continue to put a crimp on US consumer spending. 
Rebuilding Euro Governance
There was no support for centralizing any significant elements of fiscal policy – nor is there today.
Increasingly, the small spreads between sovereign bonds relied on the implicit assumption that no euro area member would be allowed to get into major difficulties, despite the constraints imposed on intergovernmental rescue operations.
Improved surveillance – and the scary experience of having confronted the potential costs of being deprived of access to international financial markets – offers hope that the decentralized model for the euro area’s non-monetary policy components will work better than in the past.
Right now, the international relief efforts in Haiti are rightly focused on the country’s urban areas, which suffered most in the earthquake.
IFAD funded a program to kick-start food production.
Much-needed capital investment can enable smallholder farmers to provide the private sector with a sustainable supply of high-quality agricultural produce.
Indeed, the private sector has a pivotal role to play in rural development, not just in Haiti but throughout the developing world.
Asylum seekers have been the main victims.
And, to do that, it must share the burden fairly – a principle that a qualified majority finally established at last Wednesday’s summit.
In addition, the EU also should help create special economic zones with preferred trade status in the region, including in Tunisia and Morocco, to attract investment and generate jobs for both locals and refugees.
This will require negotiating with frontline countries, in cooperation with the UN Refugee Agency, to establish processing centers there – with Turkey as the priority.
Recession Geopolitics
US financial institutions should have continued to lend to distressed borrowers, in order to prevent a spiral in which credit rationing forced price reductions and intensified world deflation.
For a moment, it looked as if a contagious crisis, driven by fears of government over-indebtedness, would destroy the politically fragile compromise that European countries had carefully constructed over a 50-year period. The turning point in this spring’s euro panic came when big holders of reserve currencies signaled that they saw the need for the euro as an alternative to the increasingly problematic dollar and the equally vulnerable yen.
Since the early twentieth century, Mexicans have felt worried and threatened by American strength.
Such insurance, they argue, would help firms and people deal with the “extreme uncertainty” of the current economic environment.
The IMF authors are not saying that governments should do this with recession insurance, so perhaps they mean that governments would auction off the policies, which would create a market price.
The Assura Group had to get permission from the New York State Department of Insurance to have a dynamic rate filing, meaning that they will set prices by a formula, rather than using a fixed rate, so that their prices vary in rapid response to changing economic conditions.
There are uncertainties with any really new proposal.
It all looks as if the need to integrate communities within nations, to reconcile them with their past in order to unite them around a common identity and therefore a common project for the future, has replaced Europe’s now-completed mission of reconciling old enemies like Germany and France.
The silence that surrounded Holocaust survivors during the immediate postwar reconstruction of Europe has been replaced by gestures of contrition and reparation.
And it has concluded that centuries of slavery amount to the equivalent of the Holocaust. European recognition of crimes against the Jews, they argue, must be followed by an admission of guilt towards the Continent’s black minorities.
GAZA/JERUSALEM – As representatives of Hamas and Fatah meet for the fourth round of national unity talks in Cairo, not only Palestinians but also Americans and Europeans will be watching closely.
Whereas Fatah favors a clear majority voting system, Hamas calls for a more personalized approach.
In the absence of a strong central authority, the predominant divide between secular nationalism and politicized religion has led to the actual geographic disintegration of the Palestinian Territories into two distinct parts.
But a modified and more pragmatic stance that focuses on Hamas’s behavior on the ground, rather than on abstract conditions, would not only be demanding for Western decision makers; it would pose a major political challenge for Hamas as well.
Given the innumerable atrocities that the FARC have committed, the prospect of suspending punishment is difficult to accept. But prolonging a conflict that has already led to more than 200,000 deaths and displaced roughly five million people is in no one’s interest.
Following this logic, FARC leader Pablo Catatumbo has acknowledged the “pain and acts of cruelty” that the guerillas have committed and has requested a collective pardon that would cover human-rights violations committed by both the FARC and state security forces.
Even an economy as impoverished as Haiti’s is a complex system dependent on trade between rural and urban areas, transport, electricity, port services, and government functions.
The economy will have a simple structure in the coming years, with most economic activities focused in five sectors: smallholder, or peasant, agriculture; reconstruction; port services and light manufacturing; local small-scale trade; and public services, including health care and education.
Haiti, like its next-door neighbor, the Dominican Republic, once created jobs in port facilities, including production of clothing, baseballs, and other light-manufacturing items.
In addition, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of native Haitian NGOs.
We therefore need money in the bank, and clear leadership.
The first results to be counted were for Kenya’s parliament, with Kibaki’s government ministers roundly defeated in their local constituencies.
As a result, many more votes were recorded by the ECK for the presidential race than for the parliamentary race, even though voters were clearly instructed – indeed required – to cast a vote in both races.   
Second, she claimed that there had been vote rigging “on both sides,” and suggested that the true election results were very close and that perhaps Kibaki had won.
By standing up for democratic principles, the world would truly stand on the side of the Kenyan people.
If Kibaki rejects an independent recount, his refusal will reverberate around Kenya and the world.
First, I argued that while it might do local good, it would damage the rules of international relations as they were then understood.
Despite this, the term “genocide,” freely bandied about by Western interventionists, was grotesquely inappropriate at any time.
As then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan rightly argued, this opened the door to the proliferation of unilateral, lawless use of force.  
But world leaders should take them seriously.
Moreover, the shift from recovery efforts to fiscal consolidation and, more recently, to current-account rebalancing, has undermined the initial G-20-led coordinated recovery efforts.
Understandably, China has resisted, probably mindful of the post-1985 yen appreciation’s association with the end of Japan’s four-decade-long post-war boom.
Recovery before Reform

Then the Money Power struck back, aided and abetted by its apologist cohort of economists.
National regulators are exploring ways to vary ratio requirements over the business cycle, and have started subjecting banks to regular “stress tests.”
But little progress has been made in (re)implementing this idea.
Redefining Sustainable Development
For almost three decades, sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising future generations’ ability to meet their needs.
The process of identifying the Sustainable Development Goals, which are intended to enter into force in 2015, has begun in earnest.
And achieving food security is impossible without agricultural systems and practices that not only support farmers and produce enough food to meet people’s nutritional needs, but that also preserve natural resources by, for example, preventing soil erosion and relying on more efficient nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers.
Moreover, technological progress is becoming ever more “labor-saving,” with computers and robots replacing human workers in settings ranging from supermarkets to automobile assembly lines. Given the volatile macroeconomic outlook, many firms are reluctant to hire new workers, leading to high youth unemployment throughout the world.
Maternity and paternity leave should be increased where it is low, such as in the United States.
The recent G-20 summit occurred with virtually no real preliminary work.
After all, if the economy is to grow again, banks need borrowers, but the recession has led entrepreneurs to cut their investments.
Until that point, America’s pledge to maintain the gold standard was the basis for the global fixed-exchange-rate system, which was the heart of the Bretton Woods framework.
Under their pressure, more and more processes were “outsourced.”
Redesigning European Energy Security
Aside from devising a single energy strategy to deal with Russia, however, the EU must enhance its cooperation with the Kremlin on such issues as nuclear policy and counter-terrorism in order to foster warmer relations in general.
A solar or wind lobby can be just as self-serving as an oil or gas lobby, while excessive government involvement in the energy sector through subsidies or restrictive regulation can distort natural market conditions and ultimately damage alternative energy development. Similarly, EU-wide collaboration on research and development and on subsidy programs should be encouraged in order to prevent individual member states’ policies from undercutting each other’s efforts.
The absence of a European “grand strategy,” together with the way Europeans undercut each other, leaves these issues unresolved, and in some cases exacerbates the problems.
We strongly support the Burmese opposition’s campaign calling on the country’s citizens to reject the constitution, which does not promote human rights, but only confirms the military’s political role.
The UN Security Council should consider introducing a universal arms embargo, and the EU should adopt banking sanctions that target the regime and its cronies.
After all, the oft-repeated principle that the IMF’s managing director should be chosen on the basis of merit rather than nationality need not mean a departure from past practice.
These countries do not have the excessive budget deficits that many European countries ran up during the last expansion – and that are culminating in today’s mismanaged sovereign-debt crisis.
·Agustín Carstens, the governor of Mexico’s central bank, has been described as the leading prospect among the group.
She became one of the World Bank’s three managing directors last year, after apparently being forced out as Indonesia’s finance minister for doing too good a job.
·Montek Ahluwalia is Deputy Chairman of India’s Planning Commission, a position far more important than it sounds.
New types of loyalty and association are challenging the state’s traditional role.
A global reordering of economic growth is punishing the developed countries’ high-cost, high-tax, high-benefits governance model.
The question for international governance is how to provide a framework of institutions and rules in a world of competing organizational structures.
That is not good enough.
As it stands, European economic output per capita remains well below 2008 levels.
These recommendations are based not on theoretical academic fancy, but on policies that are already proving their worth in at least one European country.
This is not gimmickry; it is a sensible distinction between current and capital accounts, a staple of public finance.
Yet Europe has been struggling for years, even as other economies have engineered recoveries.
The need for an effective UN Security Council reflects the central strategic certainty of the post-Cold War period: security threats are no longer likely to take the form of war between states, but will instead consist in acts of terror, civil wars, and massacres of civilian populations.
For the Security Council to be effective in providing global governance in the domain of security, it must be reformed to reflect the realities of the twenty-first century.
A far-reaching reform will be difficult, and some may regard it as beyond our reach.
The Commission is chaired by Sir John Vickers, the Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, which in British academia is about as good as it gets. At his side sits Martin Wolf of The Financial Times, so a good reception in the pink pages can be expected.
“The social costs would be significant,” he warns, as the synergies between deposit-taking and lending would be lost.
One reform that does find favor is what the Commission describes as a “retail ring-fence.”
Reforming Macho Politics
All countries, for example, should adopt quotas requiring that no more than half of parties’ legislative candidates in each district be of the same sex.
Such legislation must also have rigid compliance standards that are reviewed and enforced by the state’s electoral authorities and courts.
President Xi’s Singapore Lessons
The success of both countries reflects many contributing factors, including a skilled and educated group of policymakers supplied by a meritocratic selection system, and a pragmatic, disciplined, experimental, and forward-looking approach to policy.
To maintain single-party legitimacy – and thus the ability to govern – those narrower interests must be overridden in favor of the general interest.
And then they should return to the task of governing in a complex domestic and global environment.
Reforming Russia’s Military Industrial Complex
The percentage of the defense budget allocated to purchasing military equipment will rise from 44% in 2006 to 50% by 2011.
Moreover, where the USSR transferred much weaponry under easy commercial terms or without charge (e.g., under long-term loans not expected to be repaid), Russia now discounts arms only for its closest allies.
Russian officials also contend that US and other foreign objections often reflect a desire to eliminate unwelcome Russian competition or curtail the Kremlin’s influence in important regions, such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
But what is meant by unacceptable varies greatly from country to country.
After all, much of what makes a house a habitat lies outside of his department’s purview.
It artificially creates – as in France – socially homogenous poor neighborhoods where the unskilled live among themselves, disconnected from others, making it harder for them to benefit from the agglomeration economies that would boost their productivity.
They are bound to choose older homes in established neighborhoods that have already been connected to the many networks that make them a habitat.
A more useful framework would view the state and the market as two sides of the same coin, bound together by the property-rights infrastructure (PRI).
For a large economy like China – which has overlapping bureaucracies in different state agencies, and many layers of government extending from the central administration to local units – creating a transparent, fair, and effective PRI is particularly complex.
Given this, China’s continued economic success depends on reducing state ownership of productive capital, facilitating market innovation and growth, and investing in human capital, such as through education, health care, and social welfare.
In order to navigate the complex market-state relationship and achieve a beneficial outcome, Chinese policymakers must have a clear idea of where the state’s limited capacity and political capital are needed most.
For their part, Western countries must avoid the traps of the difficult negotiation process that the deal demands, without losing sight of their strategic goal of ending the conflict.
Likewise, the West must recognize that reconciliation in Syria will be impossible without reconciliation between the Sunni and Shia regimes in the wider region.
The West’s lofty and self-serving rhetoric has not helped to end Syria’s conflict; it may even have made the situation more dangerous.
Hope gives way to prolonged misery – not for a few months or even a year, but on average for more than a decade.
In 2014, education received just 1% of humanitarian funds – leaving millions of children and young people on the streets or idle in camps.
Complicating the situation, officials have had to persuade a divided country, already worried about the influx of refugees (which has added 20% to the country’s population).
Similarly, in Pakistan, the Peshawar massacre last month has revealed how much more must be done to protect schools and children’s future.
In short, no.
But the refugee crisis has exposed the flipside of the Schengen Agreement – namely, the difficulty of monitoring national and EU territory without border controls.
But the issues they raise are not the same.
The question is whether Europe’s politicians – who have failed to deliver on far less complicated issues over which they had a lot more control – can seize the moment.
European politicians have yet to catch up with the reality on the ground, let alone get ahead of it.
Already, it is unlocking additional fiscal outlays in countries like Germany – which, despite having the means, did not previously have the will to spend – thereby helping to alleviate an aggregate-demand imbalance that, together with structural impediments to growth and excessive indebtedness in some countries, has held back the region’s recovery.
BRUSSELS – The tragic exodus of people from war-torn Syria and surrounding countries challenges the world’s reason and sympathy.
The 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees recognized a right of asylum for those unable to return to their country of origin owing to a “well founded” fear of persecution.
This is justified by the fiction that the citizens of EU countries are members of a single polity.
The US and Russia back different sides.
The Limits of the German Promised Land
Between €1,000 ($1,120) and €1,200 per person per month is being transferred to the municipalities to cover the costs of accommodating them.
But the proportion of Syrian refugees subsequently ballooned quickly, in part because the news spread that Germany approves most Syrian applications.
Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees could set up border outposts to clear baseless asylum claims and send the rejected applicants, in accordance with the Dublin Regulation, back to the first safe country they reached.
Fiscal positions are solid and public debt amounts to only 32% of the region’s GDP.
The Fed’s policy of quantitative easing exacerbates the flow of excess liquidity, which could result in dangerous bubbles in emerging markets.
While Chile has not yet intervened in the foreign-exchange market, Colombia and Peru have increased their international reserves massively.
The failure of jihadism is paving the way for a potentially promising restructuring of Islamic politics, but the West either doesn’t recognize the changes or is hostile to them.
Just as Islamic democracy is the natural reaction to Arab secular autocracy and to the West’s collaboration with it, so will the destruction of political Islam usher in even more extreme options with movements like Hamas going back to social work and terror, and with al-Qaeda making inroads into Islamic societies.
The practical necessities of politics are bound to dilute ideological purity.
Indeed, addressing the underlying security concerns that fuel nuclear competition in regional trouble spots is more important to the credibility of Global Zero’s goal of “a world without nuclear weapons” than is encouraging exemplary behavior by the two major nuclear powers.
A country that in the summer of 2006 had to send a million of its citizens to underground shelters to escape massive ballistic warfare conducted by a non-state agent, Hezbollah, now faces an “Islamic Awakening” that it cannot fully fathom, and, with it, an ominous worsening of its strategic environment.
A Middle East free of nuclear weapons certainly is preferable to a region with two or more nuclear-weapons states.
Trade agreements have long stopped being the province of experts and technocrats.
Trade agreements do not create jobs; they simply reallocate them across industries.
In the TTIP, the reduction of so-called non-tariff barriers to trade between the US and Europe will almost certainly restrict the space for domestic regulatory action.
Finally, what especially grates on the agreements’ critics is the secrecy of the negotiations.
And that is possible only if the negotiating texts are opened to public scrutiny.
Unlike any first lady in Argentine history, she is capable and well prepared when discussing complex issues such as money laundering or labor law.
In the Argentina of the 1940’s and 1950’s, Evita gathered multitudes.
The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo became the same: they would put their motherhood above their lives.
Cristina loves being compared to Hillary.
BRUSSELS – The most visible symptom of the crisis in the eurozone has been the high and variable risk premiums that its peripheral countries now must pay on their public debt.
Indeed, only those countries that were running large current-account deficits before the crisis were affected by it.
First, it has often been pointed out that austerity can be self-defeating, because a reduction in the fiscal deficit can lead in the short run to an increase in the debt/GDP ratio if both the debt level and the multiplier are large.
But the reverse is also true: as soon as the current account swings to surplus, the pressure from financial markets abates.
The first is that the European Union provides the necessary funds on a permanent basis, creating a “European Transfer Union” to the benefit of the deficit countries, including Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy.
While that would stimulate inward tourism and real-estate sales, what sounds easy and manageable to the layman would in fact be the most problematic solution for Greece, because it would add fuel to internal protests to a point that could destabilize the eastern Mediterranean.
·        The German system. In Germany, a “stability council” must approve state budgets.
All of this is unpleasant, and it may not appeal to politicians who believe in dreams.
Indeed, the idea that bubbles exist has become so disreputable in much of the economics and finance profession that bringing them up in an economics seminar is like bringing up astrology to a group of astronomers.
They live in a world where economic decisions are fundamentally ambiguous, because the future doesn’t seem to be a mere repetition of a quantifiable past.
Economists have also been right to apply his theory to a range of microeconomic issues, such as why monopolists set higher prices.
This will happen as economists’ redirect their research efforts by listening to scientists with different expertise.
And, in many places, oil supplies are declining as old oil fields are depleted.
And solar power plants in the Sahel of Africa, just south of the vast Sahara, could supply power to much of West, East, and Central Africa. 
It is shocking, and worrisome, that public financing remains slight, because these technologies’ success could translate into literally trillions of dollars of economic output.
PRINCETON – The euro crisis and Queen Elizabeth’s recent Jubilee seem to have nothing in common.
It is through Homer that virtually all Western readers first encounter the Mediterranean world: its islands and shores and peoples knit together by diplomacy, trade, marriage, oil, wine, and long ships.
The Turks will not let Cypriot ships into their harbors and have not been on speaking terms with the Israelis since nine Turkish citizens were killed on a ship that sought to breach Israel’s blockade of Gaza.
The EU today is on the ropes, but only a few concrete steps by European leaders might open the door to similarly bold diplomacy that could restore EU and Mediterranean economies and transform the energy politics of Europe and Asia.
At a time when the European Union and the United States are anxious to promote political and economic reform in the Arab world, they should not overlook the Maghreb.
For its part, the US has sponsored a number of specific actions to promote democracy and good governance in the region.
But while the EU is emphasizing its bilateral relations with Maghreb countries, not enough attention – or funding – is being given to the sub-regional dimension.
Although EU assistance from the Barcelona process is significant, it does not have a decisive impact on Maghreb economies.
But the real challenge lies in providing direction for the World Bank that reflects the world as it is, and re-calibrating the Bank’s tools accordingly.
At the same time, the biggest threat to the international order comes from failing, failed, post-conflict, and conflict-ridden states.
It also must strengthen its know-how in capacity-building, particularly administrative capacity-building, with an emphasis on its legal-institutional aspects.
Switching off a TV that no one is watching.
But now a renaissance of their mindset is taking place, as climate change becomes common knowledge.
Why should we conserve? The West was responsible for all the pollution and waste in the first place.
Sunlabob, a private company in Laos, is renting solar lanterns to poor villagers, who find them more affordable than candles.
We already have a deep-rooted tradition of conservation.
But not one person was ever charged with a crime, much less tried and punished.
While some see no contradiction, the fact that many of the collaborators who killed secular and pro-democracy Bengalis in 1971 claimed to be doing so in the name of Islam points to an evident tension.
But, all too often, clichés become established because they are true.
There has been particular interest (most specifically in the case of Islam) as to whether specific religious traditions are compatible with the institutions and values of liberal democracy.
On the institutional level, pluralism means that established religions can no longer take for granted that a particular population will supinely submit to its authority.
From the standpoint of their compatibility with modern liberal democracy, acceptance of pluralism, more than adherence to particular beliefs and practices, may be what most clearly distinguishes religions.
Engagement means that the tradition is carried into the open discourse of the culture, and that those who represent the tradition make unapologetic truth claims.
“I am very sorry,” he said to startled onlookers. “I have come too late.”
Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as occasions to let out sentiments that can find no expression through the normal political process.
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad, as well as the first to hold an open press conference.
And, while domestic problems may seem intractable, distance increases the confusion and fatigue induced by seemingly intractable international problems.
It is for this reason that I took up the offer from Save the Children to visit the Gaza Strip last week.
There is no electricity for up to eight hours a day.
The Qattan Center for the Child is a privately funded library – and drama, computer, and youth center – that would grace any British community.
That is true, too.
What they need is a chance to shape their own futures.
But there was always more to Schmidt’s outlook on the world: As a son of Germany’s largest port city, he was a committed internationalist, genuinely interested in what lay beyond our borders.
That same year he sat next to East Germany’s leader Erich Honecker in Helsinki while signing the “Final Act” of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe – a major breakthrough for détente policy and in opening the closed societies of the USSR and Warsaw Pact.
Thus, European integration had to be created by real policies and institutions, not by decree. So he and Giscard created the European Council (composed of the heads of Europe’s governments), which is now a major player in the European Union’s institutional set-up.

I felt a prodigious, restless energy that I suspected he could not turn off if he wanted to.  Soon after I began to recount my observations, he took me to a map of Vietnam and asked me to locate the areas of destruction.
A memo recommending these steps was circulated to McNamara, Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach, and Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy.
Thus, the main reason for not fighting the war in the first place, namely the perfectly obvious hatred of the majority of the population for the American invasion and occupation, became a justification for the war.
Should he never have recommended the war, or presided over it in the first place, and should there never been an American war in Vietnam? Oh lord, yes.
In the digital age, the opposite is true: cheap computer storage, powerful processors, and ubiquitous Internet access have made remembering the norm.
Forgetting thus affords us a second chance, individually and as a society, to rise above our past mistakes and misdeeds, to accept that humans change over time.
We have much to gain individually and as a society from sharing information with each other.
The conditions under which Zhao Ziyang lived at the time of his death, in utter isolation from Chinese society due to an illegally imposed 16-year house arrest, shames both Chinese justice and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
But Zhao was also the only CCP leader to propose a political reform package to tackle China’s system of one-party rule.
The only reason for Zhao’s continued ill treatment was his opposition to the violent repression of the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989.
Qiao Shi and Hu Qili initially sided with Zhao, but then withdrew their support and, instead, asked Deng Xiaoping to make the final decision.
The scale of migration from rural to urban areas and across international borders is historically unprecedented, and twenty-first-century Asia is its focal point.
At IFAD, our starting point is always the three billion people who live in the rural areas of developing countries.
The amount of money at stake is staggering: It is estimated that over the next five years, more than $2.5 trillion will be sent in remittances to developing countries, with almost 40% – coming in the form of payments of $50, $100, or $500 at a time – destined for rural areas.
The bulk of this migration happened at a time of civil war or revolution. In other places, massive outmigration occurred in the context of political change, as in Europe when communism collapsed.
The economist Avner Greif argues that these co-ethnic networks’ durability and resilience throughout history reflects their ability to enforce contracts at long distances when the existing institutional framework could not do so reliably.
Evidence of the importance of diasporas is everywhere, if you care to look. Franschhoek (French corner in Afrikaans) is a beautiful valley near Cape Town settled by Huguenots in the late seventeenth century.
Rendezvous with Africa on Climate
The economic, social, migratory, and security consequences of such vulnerability on the rest of the world cannot be ignored, as Africa will be home to more than two billion inhabitants in 2050.
Three promising tracks will have to materialize rapidly.
In the past, African countries found it difficult to make their voices heard in major international negotiations.
In Germany alone, the sector’s growth has generated 250,000 new green jobs in less than ten years.
My answer is yes. This new agency already has immense potential. 
Third, IRENA will be based in a developing country, a vote of confidence in the quality, institutional expertise, and dynamism that exists in the developing world.
ATHENS – The year 2009 has been one of great change, taking place amidst even greater uncertainty.
It is in this spirit of cooperation and bridge-building that 56 foreign ministers – representing the US, Canada, and European countries, including the Russian Federation and the rest of the former Soviet Union – will meet in Athens on December 1-2 on my invitation to discuss the future of European security.
The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of an era of mistrust and division, and opened the way for cooperation aimed at a peaceful and stable Europe.
There is a great deal to mourn about the passing of the older news model.
A new form could evolve from this changed power relationship between editors and citizens, potentially becoming as powerful as traditional journalism, if not more so.
I don’t pretend to possess journalism’s Holy Grail: a sustainable business plan for the newspaper of the future.
For these reasons, the US Department of Defense is implementing a “rebalance” of America’s strategic focus and posture to the Asia-Pacific.
We are also working to identify opportunities to deepen our cooperation in information security, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and other high-tech frontiers – from cyberspace to outer space.
For example, the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise was the largest ever, including more than 42 ships and 25,000 personnel from 22 countries, while the US and China staged their first-ever maritime counter-piracy exercise near the Horn of Africa.
Finally, we agreed with Singapore to deploy up to four Littoral Combat Ships there on a rotational basis to join it and other countries in the region for exercises, training, and responses to challenges.
A key component of the rebalance is a healthy, stable, and continuous military-to-military relationship with China, based on sustained and substantive dialogue that enhances our ability to work together and to avoid any kind of miscalculation.
We have a detailed plan for the rebalance in our budget, and we have made decisions that will make our military more cost-effective, efficient, and productive.
This time, China’s current-account surplus has been shrinking significantly, owing to the global recession caused by the collapse of the US financial bubble.
Yet the quarterly US current-account deficit actually increased – from $195 billion to $205 billion.
American companies cannot compete with these countries either.
All those problems contribute to the imbalance, and China should fix them.
By any moral standard, that goal is at least as important as anything on America’s agenda.
But how serious was the threat? In reality, China’s devaluation was puny – by the end of the week, less than 5% in all.
But the second criterion – that the currency must be “freely usable” (widely used and widely traded) – has proved to be a major stumbling block.
But the IMF has certainly noticed, suggesting that “a more market-determined exchange rate would facilitate SDR operations, in case the renminbi were included in the currency basket going forward.”
It would also be highly problematic for the global economy.
Unsurprisingly, this has exacerbated the fear of deflation, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising by just 0.8% year on year in January, and the annual decline in producer prices steepening, to 4.3%.
Given that current circumstances are far less threatening than those in the depths of the Great Crisis, the need for another tactical adjustment in currency policy is far less acute.
Strategy is China's greatest strength.
Nonetheless, adding the renminbi to the SDR basket would be symbolically important, implying recognition of China’s growing global stature.
Per Zhou’s proposal, China has championed a transition to a multi-currency reserve system, in which the SDR and an internationalized renminbi would be used more widely, including in countries’ currency reserves.
Of course, China stands to gain much from the renminbi’s emergence as an alternative international reserve currency, sharing in the “exorbitant privilege” that the US currently enjoys by virtue of the dollar’s global status.
History suggests that a shift in global currency dominance is likely to occur gradually.
No doubt, China has made remarkable progress over a relatively short period.
In short, unlike the rest of the currencies in the SDR basket, the renminbi is an international currency in the making, just as China is an economic and financial power in the making.
This goal certainly seems attainable.
In fact, given the SDR’s very limited role in the global economy, the move will have few concrete effects in the short term.
By moving away from the renminbi peg to the US dollar – an undoubtedly risky move – China demonstrated its willingness to allow market forces to establish the exchange rate in the long term.
By demonstrating its confidence in the renminbi’s continued rise, the IMF has reinforced global expectations of – and lent implicit support to – the renminbi’s progress toward internationalization. Whatever challenges China faces, its steady march to the forefront of the global economy is set to continue.
America’s failure to deal with its internal challenges would come at a steep price.
The US is also an invaluable source of ideas.
It is not just that the US lacks the means; the very nature of contemporary global problems suggests that only collective responses stand a good chance of succeeding.
Much of this was due to an export-led industrialization and urbanization strategy that opened up new opportunities in the rapidly expanding cities, where labor, capital, technology, and infrastructure came together to form supply capacities for global markets.
Indeed, contrary to popular belief outside China, the Chinese state is not monolithic; it is a highly complex bureaucracy with many layers of government and quasi-government institutions that do not always conform to central directives.
Compared to the private sector, local governments and state-owned enterprises tend to have access to significantly cheaper funding, with the gap between official interest rates and shadow-banking borrowing costs reaching as much as ten percentage points.
NEW YORK – As the United States struggles to understand last September’s attack on its diplomatic mission in Benghazi, which took the lives of four Americans, including US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, a formal investigation has not even been opened in Libya – and likely never will be.
But it is a crucial step toward establishing order and enhancing the newly elected government’s legitimacy.
Moreover, the military receives inadequate financing, with officers forced to use their personal funds to purchase gas for military vehicles.
For example, in June, Defense Minister Osama al-Juwali attacked the NTC for failing to consult with the appropriate officials on its decisions, stating that his role had been reduced to “signing the plans of the chief of staff.”
After years of negotiation and numerous scientific-assessment reports, delegations had the highest expectations for concluding a comprehensive climate treaty.
Given that the UN formally accepted the 2°C limit as the starting point for the top-down approach in 2010, the well-practiced strategy of obscuring current failures by announcing more ambitious future efforts would become unsustainable.
In order to ensure this outcome, the EU must begin preparing a Plan B that accounts for the coming climate-policy paradigm shift.
Now, suddenly, everyone has discovered that the US economy is doing well – so well that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has switched from blaming Obama for a bad economy to demanding credit for a good one.
The mystery, until recently, was why economic performance had been so weak.
(According to one measure, the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis and the 2013 government shutdown caused uncertainty comparable to that sparked by the September 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.)
The irony is that rising inequality is usually thought to play to the Democrats’ electoral advantage.
In politics, too, Yushchenko is playing with fire, having lost the support of most of “Our Ukraine,” the party he created.
Moreover, he seemed genuinely committed to reconciliation between Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east and Ukrainian-speaking west.
Given that Yushchenko has almost no chance of winning the next presidential election, Tymoshenko has made him a generous offer.
In fact, Abbas does not even control the militias of his own party, Fatah, which have been even more active than Hamas in staging terrorist attacks against Israel.
Locked in a self-imposed conceptual paralysis that does not allow for a non-military solution, Israel refuses to see that Hamas’s rocket attacks on Israeli territory are not intended to draw Israel into an invasion. Instead, they are an attempt to establish a new deterrent against Israel that would force it to agree to a cease-fire ( Tahdiye) .
A Palestinian national unity government would not impede a settlement for the simple reason that the moderates now negotiating with Israel must in any case strive for an agreement that the extremists could not label as a treacherous sell-out.
The NPT regime stands on three pillars: non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Today, the challenges posed by proliferation are more complex than ever:
For example, some countries want to develop smaller and "usable" nuclear weapons designed for pre-emptive or preventive military action. Many non-nuclear weapon states, particularly those from the developing world, remain frustrated with the fact that peaceful nuclear cooperation is yet to be fully realized.
If we are serious about saving the non-proliferation regime, the time to act is now.
Yemen ’s central problems are two: the ongoing civil war that the government is waging against the Houthi tribe in the country’s north, and the suppression of a secessionist movement in the south.
Saleh will undoubtedly resist such an effort.
And it is not just the Yemeni state that is at fault.
So, instead of exporting religious radicalism to Yemen, importing its manpower could neutralize Yemen’s problems.
First, as with all systems that preceded it, it puts the burden of adjustment on deficit countries, not on surplus countries.
One basic reason is that the only “collective insurance” available is limited and highly conditional IMF lending.
The IMF took steps in this direction in March, particularly by creating the Flexible Credit Line for crisis-prevention purposes, as well as expanding other credit lines and overhauling conditionality (relying more on ex-ante conditionality and eliminating structural performance criteria).
Today, popular rebellion and political change have spread throughout the region.
Had the treaty been approved in 2005 as intended, it would have been in place for six years, and the strain placed by the crisis on EU economic governance – so visible in the eurozone’s recent problems – would have been much more manageable.
And, politically, Turkey has emerged as a regional leader, a role that it takes extremely seriously.
The EU now accounts for 75% of foreign investment in Turkey and roughly half its exports and inward tourism.
And we said: Turkey will be an EU member.
Most studies of supply chains examine their operations, but take for granted governments’ critical enabling role.
Recognizing the need for systemic change, China allowed local governments in special economic zones and cities to experiment with modern legal, administrative, and logistical practices for export industries, including investments in utilities and transport.
The critical mechanism for orchestrating and implementing the complex web of contracts embodied in China’s government-services supply chain is the Five-Year Plan, which foresees vertical and horizontal integration of almost all Party and administrative agencies.
Adapting the governance metric in a country of China’s size to an economy that is green, inclusive, and equitable presents a novel challenge in human history.
With foreign direct investment still flowing in, Brazil’s lower external vulnerability leaves the country in a much better position than ever before to weather the global storm – at least for now.
But Brazil’s financial markets are much more sensitive than trade to international disturbances, and monetary flows could decrease in the long term.
Beyond that, one can only hope that current external economic disturbances do not lead to a global disaster.
What is astonishing about this “model” is that it has enabled China to maintain rapid growth within a relatively stable political environment for 30 years.
But the “China model” has given the authorities the tools to avoid such an outcome.
Most forecasts suggest that, with a huge effort, China can maintain 8% growth in 2009.
This is quite a turnabout for an economy that for years had crept along at what was derisively called the “Hindu rate of growth” – around 3% – while much of the rest of Asia shot ahead.
Instead, the decline in Indian stocks reflected foreign investors’ liquidity problems: they withdrew from holdings in India because they needed their money back home, not because it wasn’t growing for them.
Obviously, the terrorist attacks of late November complicate this story.
According to the World Bank’s annual assessment of Global Economic Prospects, India’s economy could even triple in size in the next 15 to 20 years.
Globally, however, solar and wind are only a small part of total renewables – less than 7% in 2010. Hydropower is a much bigger player, at 17%.
The climate effect could be a net increase in emissions if forests are cleared to create energy-crop plantations.
For example, burning a hectare of harvested willow on a field previously used for barley (the typical marginal crop in Denmark) prevents 30 tons of CO2 annually when replacing coal.
Germany alone spends more than $3 billion annually, or $167 per ton of avoided CO2 emissions, which is more than 37 times the cost of carbon reductions in the European Union Emissions Trading System.
The World’s North Korean Test
There are some who would urge that we all remain calm (good advice in most circumstances) and somehow take comfort in the fact that North Korea still faces many serious technical hurdles before it can successfully add nuclear weapons to its considerable conventional arsenal.
One thing we know about the North Koreans is that, unless they can use such rhetoric in their own propaganda (they got far more traction out of former US President George W. Bush’s infamous “axis of evil” remark than he ever did), they simply don’t care what is said about them.
There are also those – a dwindling minority, fortunately – who continue to suggest that more needs to be done on the negotiating track.
As it stands, many pundits see little promise for R2P, foreseeing instead an intensifying deadlock between Western interventionists and non-Western stalwarts of sovereignty.
Consider the South African and Tanzanian troops using military force, under a Brazilian commander, to fight armed groups in the Congo, and the many African statesmen whose efforts have been central in mediation attempts across the continent.
Second, policymakers, academics, and activists around the world need to address the question of how to protect effectively.
What the British did for us, the extraordinary generosity they showed refugees like me during those difficult war years, stood out.
One recalls the reluctance on the part of the Dutch and the Belgians even to issue transit visas to refugees like me attempting to reach England from Germany during World War II, for fear that we would remain in their countries.
Meanwhile, wealthy countries like the United States, Canada, and the Gulf monarchies have largely closed their doors to the refugees, just as the US closed its doors to all but a tiny number of the Jews fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe.
The least the rest of us can do is welcome them.
All too often, notions such as “reserve agricultural land,” or “idle land,” are manipulated out of existence, sometimes being used to designate land on which many livelihoods depend, and that is subject to long-standing customary rights.
The underlying problem runs deeper than how the principles have been formulated.
But they also create a number of social costs that are not accounted for in the market price of their output.
To re-launch agriculture in the developing world would require an estimated $30 billion per year, representing 0.05% of global GDP.
The Turkish government, unwisely, became embroiled with the EU over its plan to extend the customs union to include all new member states, including Cyprus.
Some argue that it would be better to leave Cyprus alone and revisit the problem only in the closing stages of Turkey’s EU accession.
Given the island’s complexity, and Cypriot sensitivity, it would be foolish for an outsider to try to sketch any future settlement.
While the EU must be present, it cannot be a neutral mediator, since Greece and Cyprus are both members.
Likewise, in his second inaugural address, US President Barack Obama discussed climate change more than any other issue, saying, “We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries.”
But other, less widely discussed factors must be considered –&#160;particularly the costs of delayed action on climate change. For example, Unilever CEO Paul Polman reported that extreme weather cost his company $250-300 million in 2012.
And, given rising global demand for oil, particularly in developing countries, energy-import prices will remain high.
By maintaining high environmental standards, and promoting such standards among its trade partners, Europe can bolster the global market for clean-energy technologies.
And, by 2040, India’s population will have reached 1.6 billion, surpassing China’s, which will have stagnated a decade earlier.
As other advanced economies become increasingly services-based, the US is reindustrializing.
But implementing the eight policy proposals would also widen further the wealth gap between the US and Europe, which has been growing for the last three decades. In 1980-2005, the US economy grew by a factor of 4.45 – a level that no major European economy even approached.
And conditions in Africa and Latin America are generally stabilizing.
Washington Consensus reforms – including macroeconomic stabilization (defined as low-single-digit inflation) and market liberalization – were supposed to reduce poverty by accelerating economic growth.
The UN encourages governments to assume a more proactive development role, which would entail an integrated policymaking approach aimed at promoting structural change while reducing inequality, vulnerability, and economic insecurity.
But, in general, universal social policies have been much more effective and politically sustainable, while policies targeting the poor, or the “poorest of the poor,” have often been costly and neglectful of many of those in need.
सन् 1945 से खाद्य उत्पादन तीन गुना बढ़ा है. प्रति व्यक्‍ति खाद्य उपलब्‍धता भी औसतन 40% बढ़ी है. केवल पिछले एक दशक में एशिया-प्रशांत क्षेत्र में सब्जियों का उत्पादन एक-चौथाई बढ़ा है. इस क्षेत्र में दुनिया की तीन-चौथाई सब्जियां उगाई जाती हैं.

बेहतर पोषण की आर्थिक मंशा भी है. अपने सभी स्वरूपों में कुपोषण कम उत्पादन व अतिरिक्‍त खर्चों के कारण हर साल वैश्‍विक आर्थिक कल्याण में लगभग 5% की कमी लाता है. अनुमान है कि सूक्ष्मपोषण कमियों को दूर करने से मिले आर्थिक लाभों से लागत/लाभ अनुपात लगभग 1:13 तक बढ़ जाता है. यानी लागत से 13 गुना ज्यादा लाभ मिलता है.
And, from the 1990s on, globalization – in particular, China’s integration into the world economy – has probably been the main reason for the decline in global inflationary pressure.
Given this, targeting consumer prices in the next 2-3 years will not guarantee that the value of money remains stable in the long term.
Central banks’ exclusive focus on consumer prices may even be counterproductive.
Temporary fluctuations in a narrow and imprecisely measured CPI are a small price to pay to secure the long-term stability of money.
With the 1995 Social Summit adopting a wider definition of poverty that includes deprivation, social exclusion, and lack of participation, the situation today may be even worse than suggested by a money-income poverty line.
In addition, new and potentially viable production capacities need to be fostered through complementary developmental policies.
This is not to deny some positive consequences.
There will be no real poverty eradication without equitable and sustainable economic development, which deregulated markets have proved unable to deliver on their own.
This is already taking place in the trade realm.
This was demonstrated by the American and world reaction to terrorism.
If a state fails to live up to its side of the bargain by sponsoring terrorism, either transferring or using weapons of mass destruction, or conducting genocide, then it forfeits the normal benefits of sovereignty and opens itself up to attack, removal, or occupation.
They created tests that can establish a person’s HIV status or gauge the disease’s progression.
Across Africa, the disease is estimated to have reduced average national growth rates by 2-4 percentage points a year.
“It is very hard to take the antiretroviral drugs without having any food in the stomach and when I am worrying about where I am going to live,” she said.
Thirty years after the discovery of HIV/AIDS, we have seen impressive scientific and policy advances.
There are reports that, behind the scenes, things are different.
He has just over a year-and-a-half to go to complete his second and final five-year term as South Africa’s president.
The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 was probably the last masterpiece of Franco-German creativity.
The election a year ago of French President Nicolas Sarkozy might have promised a new era of cooperation.
But the larger geo-strategic questions, such as the EU’s relations with Russia and its links to NATO, require the attention of a larger leadership team, including Eastern European countries.
The Return of the Ugly German
In terms of foreign policy, Germany rebuilt trust by embracing Western integration and Europeanization.
One wonders whether Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble knew what they were doing.
But the massive conflict with France and Italy, the eurozone’s second and third largest economies, is not over, because, for Schäuble, Grexit remains an option.
The foundation of the second, unified German nation-state in 1989 was based on Germany’s irrevocable Western orientation and Europeanization.
Crises like those we have recently endured were initially driven by excessive debt and leverage among private-sector agents – households, banks and financial institutions, corporate firms.
And, of course, such weekend dramas are still with us, as EU and eurozone policymakers recently spent a desperate weekend developing a rescue package not only for Greece, but also for other weak eurozone members.
Political gridlock in Washington and in the United States Congress demonstrates the absence of the bipartisanship needed to address America’s fiscal issues.
The European Central Bank managed to relieve an incipient credit crunch through its long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), which lent over a trillion euros to eurozone banks at one percent.
The Bundesbank has become aware of the danger.
Other countries have gone through similar experiences.
To be realistic, the current fiscal compact governing the eurozone must be taken as the starting point.
A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) owning the rights could use the ECB to finance the cost of acquiring the bonds without violating Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty.
This was ultimately achieved, but only after President Anwar Sadat embraced a strategy of peace by journeying to Jerusalem. The most ominous case, however, was Germany in the 1930s, which systematically shredded the European order that had emerged after World War I.
While neither option is particularly appealing, the dangers of a war with Russia cannot be overestimated.
If Putin's dangerous brinkmanship is to be stopped, Western leaders will need to find a way to initiate strategic cooperation with Russia. Specifically, they must devise a grand bargain for peace that addresses the fundamental questions relating to global security norms and arms control that have so far impeded such cooperation.
Some countries – like the United Kingdom and Australia – went so far as to unbundle these functions by assigning responsibility for financial stability to specialized agencies and extricating their central banks from financial supervisory issues altogether.
It is now increasingly recognized that significant asset-price increases (for example, in real estate or existing equities) may well be reinforced by the pro-cyclical nature of risk assessment embodied in those rules.
Capital buffers to absorb losses during the downturn of the cycle can be more easily built during the upswing.
The so-called “Miracle on the Han River” took root with the reforms initiated by Park’s late father Park Chung-hee, the country’s ruler for much of the 1960’s and 1970’s.
Employment at the country’s largest companies is falling, and the share of South Korean jobs at such companies has dropped by one-third since 1995.
Without action, the economy faces the threat of declining consumption and even shrinking output.
Aggressive development of services – such as transport, retail, and restaurants, which today are dominated by low-productivity, low-paying local businesses, many run by sole proprietors – is another imperative.
The task is no less than to achieve South Korea’s second miracle on the Han River.
Only ten universities from the entire EU have ever made it into the top 50. Germany’s top university, Heidelberg, ranks 58th.
But the EU and European governments must do more.
But just throwing money at universities isn’t enough.
However fierce the global competition, they should concentrate on safeguarding quality and achieving excellence in research and education.
She returned to Bangladesh from exile, which the army had imposed on her.  After her return she still had to endure imprisonment and trumped-up murder charges.
The example of Hamas and Hezbollah provide a salutary reminder of the challenges faced by the new government in Bangladesh.
Bangladesh is a country rich with human potential, but that potential can only be realized by making poor people’s needs – which Islamists around the world have previously made their own political territory – the new government’s top priority.
The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index in the United States, begun in 1967, fell in October to its lowest value ever.
Animal spirits are not always shattered by extraordinary economic events.
The stunning magnitude of recent declines cannot be dismissed as a one-day anomaly caused by a technical trading glitch.
Perhaps the saving grace in this situation is that animal spirits can and sometimes do change direction.
Some measures – Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 and from the Gaza Strip in 2005, or Hamas’ year-long ceasefire – might be seen as constructive.
Syria, however, cannot be ignored, since it is capable of undermining attempts at reaching an Israeli-Palestinian track or stabilizing Lebanon.
The Syrian government itself has realized that it must demonstrate its willingness for dialogue by offering Israel unconditional negotiations, receiving the Iraqi and Palestinian presidents for talks in Damascus, and supporting intra-Palestinian talks. But it has yet to send convincing and reassuring signals towards Lebanon.
According to its program, the government will respect all agreements signed by the PLO.
A Europe of Solidarity, Not Only Discipline
Call this the tragedy of the European Union.
That is not conducive to a harmonious partnership.
Wallenberg was a hero who saved the lives of many Jews in my home city of Budapest by establishing Swedish safe houses.
Some 60,000 refugees who sought to register have been put into detention facilities where conditions are inhumane.
As soon as possible, I will dispatch an OSIFE needs-assessment team to Greece to contact the authorities – and the people and organizations already helping the needy – to work out a plan for which we can generate public support.
Burma is a deeply religious country, where most men spend some time as Buddhist monks.
Many political dissidents in South Korea were inspired by their Christian beliefs, and the same is true in China.
Men and women who found strength in their belief in Communism resisted the Nazis with equal tenacity.
Liberals are most needed when compromises have to be made, but not nearly as useful when faced with brute force.
So, whichever side gains the upper hand, authoritarianism and economic stagnation will prevail once again.
Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Tunisia, and soon perhaps other countries in the region will serve as fertile grounds for a new, more militarily oriented Al Qaeda, which will become a more powerful factor in the Middle East’s cacophony of interests and ideologies.
Withdrawal is one of the riskiest military maneuvers, because it can easily degenerate into panicky retreat and chaos.
So, when the Islamist revolution does return, it is likely to be even more powerful and violent.
Concerned that the Arab rebellions would radicalize their own repressed minorities, they refuse to allow the UN Security Council to be used to promote revolutionary changes in the Arab world.
Each case has elicited a different response, owing either to the constraints of international power politics, as is now the case with respect to Syria, or to economic and strategic considerations, as in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
Since its victory in the Cold War, America’s hegemony in the Middle East has been a story of frustration and unrewarded investment of blood, sweat, and treasure.
Revolutionary Shadows
I assumed that I was supposed to be provoked into unguarded comments, a method that fashionable TV journalists everywhere use nowadays.
Revitalization of the extreme right in Hungary and the rise of “National Bolshevism” in Russia, where Tolstoy is now re-condemned by the Orthodox Church as a proto-communist, suggest a deeper and more pervasive atavistic longing.
For far different reasons, the US, and the entire world, seems condemned to simplification of thought, action, and feeling in the service of immediate, quotidian efficiency.
But the resulting economic inaction would be just as damaging to the consolidation of democratic rule.
In Tunisia, too, the budget deficit has widened sharply in the wake of the revolution, rising from 2.6% of GDP in 2010 to 6% in 2011.
Economic weakness thus provides an unprecedented opportunity for international engagement with the new Arab leadership, which should incorporate short-, medium-, and long-term goals.
Only a combination of these options would allow Arab economies to create jobs in the short term, while avoiding the risks of destabilizing fiscal imbalances or a lack of financing for private-sector investment.

इस उदाहरण का सबक यह है कि कच्चे माल का मूल्य संवर्द्धन विविधीकरण का एक मार्ग है, पर जरूरी नहीं कि यह लंबा हो या हमेशा फलदायी रहे. देश अपने यहां उपलब्ध कच्चे माल तक ही सीमित नहीं है. आखिर स्विट्जरलैंड के पास कोको नहीं है और चीन उन्नत मेमोरी चिप नहीं बनाता है. लेकिन इससे इन देशों को क्रमशः चाकलेट और कंप्यूटर के बाजार में अपना दबदबा कायम करने में कोई बाधा नहीं उत्पन्न हुई.
इसके विपरीत पेट्रोकेमिकल या इस्पात संयंत्रों का विकास अथवा कम वेतन वाले हीरा-काटने के कार्यों को भारत या विएतनाम से बोत्सवाना - एक ऐसा देश जो चार गुना से ज्यादा अमीर है - ले जाना जितना अकल्पनाशील है उतना ही सीमितकारी भी है. यूएई में कहीं अधिक रचनाशीलता पाई जा सकती है जिसने तेल से होने वाली आमदनी का अब संरचना तथा सुविधाओं में निवेश किया है. इसके परिणामस्वरूप दुबई आज सफल पर्यटन व व्यापारिक केंद्र में तब्दील हो चुका है.
Venezuela’s government needs to pay $5.2 billion in the first days of October.
He was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and had to launch a social-media campaign to locate the drugs that his treatment required.
Venezuela has defaulted on PDVSA’s suppliers, contractors, and joint-venture partners, causing oil exports to fall by 45% relative to 1997 and production to amount to about half what the 2005 plan had projected for 2012.
Bondholders would be wise to exchange their current bonds for longer-dated instruments that would benefit from the upturn.
The ultimate reason for such self-destructiveness may be impossible to identify. But it is certainly possible to describe how the road to hell is paved, whatever the intentions.
But controls lead to a parallel exchange rate, which can be either legal, as in Argentina, or illegal and even unpublishable, as in Venezuela.
Eventually, a major adjustment of the official rate becomes inevitable.

पूँजी की दूसरी रोचक विशेषता यह है कि यह बचतों के ज़रिए जमा होती है। कोई व्यक्ति या देश जो आय की 100 इकाई बचाता है, उसे शाश्वत रूप से लगभग 4-5 इकाई वार्षिक आय प्राप्त करने में स��्षम होना चाहिए। यहाँ से, यह देखना आसान है कि अगर पूँजी का पूरी तरह पुनः निवेश किया जाता है और अर्थव्यवस्था में 4-5% से कम की वृद्धि होती है, तो पूँजी और इसका आय का अंश अर्थव्यवस्था में तुलनात्मक रूप से बड़ा हो जाएगा।

यह क्या चल रहा है? आसान सा जवाब यह है कि चीज़़ें सिर्फ़ पूँजी और श्रम से नहीं बनाई जातीं, जैसा कि पिकेटी का तर्क है। उनमें तकनीकी ज्ञान भी शामिल होता है।
The Tacit-Knowledge Economy

Why is it that today’s smaller and more educated urbanized families in emerging-market economies are so much less productive than their counterparts were a half-century ago in today’s rich countries? Why can’t today’s emerging markets replicate levels of productivity that were achieved in countries with worse social indicators and much older technologies?
How do they create and mobilize coherent teams of people in new economic activities if the requisite tacit knowledge is missing?
The US would not have been able to build the first atomic bomb in just four years had Hitler not encouraged so many key scientists to leave Europe.
Instead, the brain is a giant hierarchical memory that is constantly recording what it perceives and predicting what will come next.
The process involves adding and combining new and existing capabilities to support more diverse and complex activities.
In a particular city or country, you can predict, even a decade in advance, which industries will appear or disappear or grow or wane just by knowing the history of what has been there and everywhere else.
We should seize this opportunity.
The poor are poor because they are victims of the powerful.
Once upon a time, in ancient Mesopotamia, oil was known to exist and it was peddled by some quacks for its medicinal powers.
They did, however, have the right to restrict access to their underground resources in order to extract rents, just as the despised agricultural landowners have done for centuries.
They are also home to thousands of new companies, many of which are quickly becoming large, global leaders in their fields.
The top 20 host cities are home to around one-third of all large companies’ headquarters and account for almost half of these companies’ combined revenue.
Those who have been writing obituaries for the emerging-market boom should give serious consideration to these trends.
They need to prepare.
Foreign investors’ purchases of emerging-market sovereign and corporate bonds almost tripled from 2009 to 2012, reaching $264 billion.
The situation is particularly difficult in some European countries.
Economic activity and business profits would have been lower, and government deficits would have been higher.
Like Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the Islamic State appears to understand the impact that lurid images of violence can have on the public imagination.
Consider, for example, how Indonesia’s Suharto regime, from 1966 to 1998, depicted alleged Communist insurgent savagery, and compelled citizens to watch it on television and in theaters.
That is why exorcising its demons will require more than military might.
Trade has been tariff-free for decades: the big impact has come from reducing non-tariff barriers arising from different national regulations. A British-made car can now be sold anywhere in the EU without having to comply with 28 member states’ safety and emissions standards.
So much for dry analysis. If you want to know what all of this means in practice, pay attention to recent statements from Diageo, the world’s largest producer of Scotch whisky.
The loss of life is devastating, and millions are rendered homeless.
Three and a half years after the dawn of the “Arab Spring,” there is a real possibility that we are witnessing the early phase of a prolonged, costly, and deadly struggle; as bad as things are, they could well become worse.
Regime change in Libya has created a failing state; lukewarm support for regime change in Syria has set the stage for prolonged civil war.
Economic assistance should go simultaneously to Jordan and Lebanon to help them cope with the flood of refugees.
Likewise, diplomacy can work in Syria only if it accepts the reality on the ground (including the survival of the Assad regime for the foreseeable future), rather than seeking to transform it.
But these objectives – including improvement of market access in agriculture, manufacturing, and services; clarification of international trade rules; and progress on addressing relevant environmental issues – were overly ambitious.
This triggered vehement protests – and strong retaliation – from America’s trading partners.
Of course, protectionist pressures have occasionally arisen since then.
African countries have plenty of experience with the downsides of major resource endowments. Kenya must learn from these cases, in order to prevent its new oil riches from tripping up East Africa in its headlong dash toward monetary union.
Of course, like any marathon, it is best not to start too fast.
If East Africa’s central bank raises interest rates to stave off inflation in Kenya, the rest of the union will experience increased unemployment.
At the beach where I surfed today, I heard about a ceremony that had taken place there earlier in the season – a farewell to a local surfer who had died at a ripe old age.
Tennis fans may admire a well-executed backhand; but watching players warm up on court would soon become dull if no match followed.
Many of the highlights of my surfing have more to do with experiencing the splendor and power of the waves than with my ability to ride them.
The price of divergence could be steep: though the worst is over, effective coordination of policy is still needed at a time when rebalancing the global economy, as the G-20 has called for, is far from being accomplished.
Emerging-market countries could also invest in euros, if only they were offered such liquid assets as US Treasury bonds – therein lies the current debate over the proposed creation of “eurobonds.”
And, because tax revenues, too, will not recover, the gap will have to be bridged by fiscal austerity.
We are neighbors, our histories and populations intertwined.
Terror and barbarity have been globalized, too.
It will play into the hands of the terrorists.
But we must also face up to the fact that we will not defeat ISIS without a bigger, more effective, and better coordinated military effort.
To his credit, British Prime Minister David Cameron clearly understands the importance of increasing the military pressure on ISIS; he had been held back by a head-under-the-blanket faction in his own Conservative Party and in Parliament as a whole.
TOKYO – At its 15th session, which ended at the beginning of October, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution encouraging governments to eliminate discrimination against people affected by leprosy – and their family members.
Unchecked, leprosy disfigures and can result in permanent disability.
The first dose of MDT kills 99.9% of the bacteria that cause leprosy, rendering the person no longer infectious.
People who have been infected with leprosy also are entitled to the same rights as everyone else with respect to full citizenship and obtaining identify documents.
A woman with short-term memory loss broke into a big smile, the company reported, when the robot asked her, “Would you like a bowl of ice cream?”
What will it do to a child, he asks, to spend a lot of time with a machine that cannot express genuine empathy, understanding, or compassion?
For the moment, a more realistic concern is not that robots will harm us, but that we will harm them.
Rio’s Unsustainable Nonsense
But the latter are “technical” and gain from standardization; the former are not and must reflect variety instead.
At what cost?
That can only come through access to education and economic opportunity, both in poor and rich countries.
A new marriage law, for example, requires interfaith couples to register their intent to marry with local authorities, who will display a public notice of the engagement; only if no citizen objects to the union – highly unlikely in the present tense climate – is the couple permitted to wed.
By stoking Buddhist violence against the Rohingya, the regime aims to damage Suu Kyi and the NLD’s chances of victory in two ways.
But the former president is now mounting a furious comeback bid and might well win the parliamentary election scheduled for August 17.
And in St. Petersberg in July 2006, the G-8 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the ambitious goals they had set the year before, although they did not go further.
I have also seen the need for ordinary Africans to embrace a set of values, like service for the common good, and commitment, persistence, and patience until a goal is realized.
In the course of my work over the past 30 years, I have observed that whether it is at the national or regional level, most conflicts are over resources. Who will control and utilize them?
They must also be empowered with knowledge, skills, and tools to take action.
A Year on the Brink
The US, with Obama re-elected, is likely to muddle on, much as it has for the past four years.&#160; Inklings of recovery in the real-estate market will be enough to discourage dramatic policy measures, like a write-down of principal on “underwater” mortgages (where the outstanding loan exceeds the market value of the house).
While European leaders have repeatedly done what previously seemed unthinkable, their responses have been out of synch with markets.
Banks have been saved, but the underlying problems were left to fester – no surprise there, given that, in both Europe and America, the task of fixing them was assigned to the policymakers who had caused them.
But switching locomotives is never free of risk.
As long as appropriate governance and revenue-administration mechanisms are put in place – particularly to avoid rent-seeking behavior – natural-resource availability may turn out to be a blessing rather than a curse for these countries.
But our point is that powerful forces that drive up asset prices may be unleashed even without massive liquidity inflows.
LONDON – Mainstream economics subscribes to the theory that markets “clear” continuously.
An economy hit by a shock does not maintain its buoyancy; rather, it becomes a leaky balloon.
Most disappointing to reformers has been the official rejection of the “Glass-Steagall” approach to banking reform.
The underlying problem, though, is that both regulators and bankers continue to rely on mathematical models that promise more than they can deliver for managing financial risks.
Gordon argues that the major technological changes that raised the standard of living in the past are much more important than anything that can happen in the future.
Moreover, because the US government does not count anything in GDP unless it is sold in the market, the vast expansion of television entertainment and the introduction of services like Google and Facebook have been completely excluded from the national account.
If real incomes grow at just 1.5% a year, the median income 30 years from now will be nearly 60% higher than the income of today’s median-income individual.
NEW HAVEN – If we have learned anything since the global financial crisis peaked in 2008, it is that preventing another one is a tougher job than most people anticipated.
In a paper presented at the session, Andrew Caplin of New York University spoke of the public’s lack of interest or comprehension of the rising risks associated with the FHA, which has been guaranteeing privately-issued mortgages since its creation during the housing crisis of the 1930’s.
Why not, I asked?
In trying to balance such considerations, the government is in over its head.
These popular, emotionally relevant narratives sometimes inspire us to go out and spend, start businesses, build new factories and office buildings, and hire employees; at other times, they put fear in our hearts and impel us to sit tight, save our resources, curtail spending, and reduce risk.
Ever since 2009, most of us have just been waiting for some story to turn our hearts aglow with hope and confidence – and to reinvigorate our economies.
Then the financial crisis erupted, scaring the entire world.
This ought to be a confidence-boosting story: amazing technologies are emerging, sales are booming, and entrepreneurship is alive and very well.
Nationalism, after all, is intrinsically bound up with individual identity.
International agencies recently issued warnings about speculative excesses in asset markets, suggesting that we should be worried about a possible crisis.
The International Monetary Fund announced in June a new Global Housing Watch website that tracks global home prices and ratios.
In fact, we have had only three salient global crises in the last century: 1929-33, 1980-82, and 2007-9.
NEW HAVEN – The depression that followed the stock-market crash of 1929 took a turn for the worse eight years later, and recovery came only with the enormous economic stimulus provided by World War II, a conflict that cost more than 60 million lives.
That name is the “new normal,” referring to long-term diminished prospects for economic growth, a term popularized by Bill Gross, a founder of bond giant PIMCO.
“Secular stagnation” and “underconsumptionism” are terms that betray an underlying pessimism, which, by discouraging spending, not only reinforces a weak economy, but also generates anger, intolerance, and a potential for violence.
According to Friedman, “Obviously nothing can enable the majority of the population to be better off than everyone else.
One problem with economics is that it is necessarily focused on policy, rather than discovery of fundamentals.
Why is it called a prize in “economic sciences,” rather than just “economics”? The other prizes are not awarded in the “chemical sciences” or the “physical sciences.”
Similarly, the terms astronomical science and hypnotic science mostly died out as the twentieth century progressed, perhaps because belief in the occult waned in respectable society.
They even have neuroses and identity problems, complex phenomena that the field of behavioral economics is finding relevant to understanding economic outcomes.
Jindal’s response reflects an ongoing – and potentially catastrophic – shift away from science-based policymaking.
And, despite the absence of evidence that mobile phones pose any kind of danger, former Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich, alleging that officials were suppressing information, introduced the “Cell Phone Right to Know Act” to require radiation warnings on the devices.
But when deciding collectively on how to confront an approaching tornado, there is an indisputable shared goal, and ignoring the experts would be wholly irrational.
The Road to Full Investment
True enough, interest rates were falling, though not as fast as the fall in expected profit on new investment.
Those who know their history will recognize that Summers is reviving an argument advanced by the American economist Alvin Hansen in 1938.
This mixture of stimulating events and policies enabled Western economies to maintain high investment ratios in the post-WWII years.
And one can think of many others.
Endgame for Putin in Ukraine?
The BRICS’ “no strings” policy explicitly challenges the conditionality imposed on borrowers by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, though the policy remains untested.
It retains a formidable nuclear capacity, but it is inconceivable that Russia would use it to secure its aims in Ukraine.
It is natural and right to think of possible compromises: Ukraine’s guaranteed neutrality, greater regional autonomy within a federal Ukraine, an interim international administration in Crimea to supervise a referendum on its future, and the like.
Putin’s power elite will start fracturing – indeed, that process may have begun already.
Particularly important is the growing discontent of economics students with the university curriculum.
The same can be said of the history of the discipline.”
Unfortunately, such assumptions have a profound influence on policy.
Publication in such journals is also the basis of promotion.
LONDON – The developed world is slowly emerging from the Great Recession, but a question lingers: How fast and how far will the recovery go? One big source of pessimism has been the idea that we are running out of investment opportunities – and have been since before the 2008 crash.
Unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing may inflate a new generation of asset bubbles, but the underlying problem – negative returns to new investment – will not have been solved by the time the next crash comes.
You can produce the result just as well by consuming more or working less.
As a result, the share of shale gas in America’s overall gas production rose from just 5% in 2007 to 36% in 2012.
But it does seem to me that contemporary apostles of secular stagnation like Summers and Paul Krugman at least ought to be taking the shale-energy revolution into account.
These measures restored peace.
There would, of course, be some temporary unemployment in the technologically advancing sectors; but, in the long run, machine-assisted production, by increasing the real wealth of the community, would enable full employment at higher wages.
As machines become ever more productive, so wages tend to fall even more, toward zero, and the population becomes redundant.
The prospect of the “abridgment of labor” should fill us with hope rather than foreboding.
But, whichever way the vote goes, the spectacular rise of nationalism, in Scotland and elsewhere in Europe, is a symptom of a diseased political mainstream.
That is why Britain has spawned two nationalisms simultaneously.
It would inherit its share of UK public-sector debt and future liabilities without the benefit of the substantial subsidy that it currently receives from the British Treasury.
And a Scottish currency that floats against the British pound would mean large transaction costs and reduced trade between the two countries.
Free Trade and Costly Love
Economists regard understanding the theory of comparative advantage as a test of professional competence.
The economist responds that the more efficient you are at your work, the more time you will have for those other things.
As Wolfers explains,
At that point, we must admit that it is irrational to spend time on long conversations with friends if it is time stolen from inventing, say, new software (unless the conversation helps the invention).
Simply put, populists seldom build a healthy economy.
Essential goods are in short supply.
The crisis for populist governments arises when those vital resources are depleted or demand for them falls. Either way, as the resources boom diminishes, populist regimes lose their legitimacy, because voters still expect to receive handouts.
As the virtual world expands, so, too, do breaches of trust and misuse of personal data.
But too much control would almost certainly stifle innovation, increase costs, and probably exclude important anti-establishment voices.
(Indeed, in a world of human-robot interfaces, 3D printing, nanotechnology, and shale-gas extraction, any innovative company must ask itself this basic question.)
वाशिंगटन, डीसी – उभरते और विकासशील देशों में किफ़ायती दवाओं तक पहुँच के बारे में होनेवाली चर्चा में अक्सर एक महत्वपूर्ण मुद्दे को अनदेखा कर दिया जाता है: इन देशों में सरकारें नेमी तौर पर जीवन के लिए महत्वपूर्ण दवाओं पर शुल्क और अन्य कर थोप देती हैं। हालाँकि इन उपायों से सामान्य राजस्व की प्राप्ति तो होती है, परंतु इनसे प्रभावित दवाएँ अधिक महँगी हो जाती हैं, जिससे ये दवाएँ उन बहुत-से लोगों के लिए पहुँच के बाहर हो जाती हैं जिन्हें उनकी सबसे ज्यादा जरूरत होती है।
प्रमुख दवा निर्माताओं - और इन करों से सबसे अधिक प्रभावित कई लोगों - के लिए प्रमुख स्थान होने के कारण - भारत और चीन को एक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय उदारीकरण के प्रयास का नेतृत्व करना चाहिए। फ़ोर्टालेज़ा, ब्राज़ील में 15-17 जुलाई को आयोजित होने वाला ब्रिक्स (BRICS) शिखर सम्मेलन इसे शुरू करने के लिए एक अच्छी जगह हो सकती है।
She recently suffered a heavy defeat in her Peronist party’s recent primaries, weakening its chances in the upcoming mid-term Congressional elections and undermining her authority during her remaining two years in office. In addition, she is now facing a legislative election in poor health, following surgery to remove a subdural hematoma in her brain.
Public opinion will not be sympathetic to fiscal discipline or neoliberal orthodoxy.
Naturally, everything can change in the future, including Russia's constitutional norms.
In addition, Rogozin is a pro-Putin politician, which is also very important to the bulk of voters, and he has managed to confirm this not only verbally, but also bureaucratically, by his work as the president's special representative for Kaliningrad Oblast affairs.
He reacts to Russia's domestic problems - widespread poverty, the situation in Chechnya, the fight against oligarchs - just as clearly, promptly, and explicitly, while most other politicians either keep silent or mumble incoherently.
Parallels between Rogozin and Saakashvili appear even more logical in view of the current situation in the Caucasus.
As a new round of negotiations with Iran begins – with European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton the first into the breach – finding a way to move Iran-US relations beyond their freighted past is an urgent matter.
Indeed, after years of sanctions, threats, negotiations, and then more sanctions and threats, the US remains unclear about what specific nuclear program it might accept.
Yet, despite increasing economic costs, Iran’s response only hardened.
Even if Iranian nuclear weapons are not acceptable to the US, President Barack Obama needs to start talking more openly about what is.
That, not Western bluster and sanctions, is the way ahead.
But such considerations were off the table well before the deliberations began.
But it gets worse.
And so they have.
The problems in Cyprus now threaten international financial stability.
In the belief that his judge, the late Laurence J. Rittenband, would renege on his promise to let Polanski go free after serving 42 days in a California prison, the director fled the United States in 1978 before his final sentence was announced.
He added that it was like “an infernal machine” that advances “blindly.”
If they are caught misbehaving, they are often treated with particular harshness by courts and the popular media alike.
So what should Polanski do?
Now, as the party’s presumptive nominee, he must move back toward the political center, where the majority of voters are to be found.
The energy and optimism that he unleashed in his administration’s first hundred days did not reflect concrete policy proposals in his campaign.
Bush showed emotional intelligence in midlife by mastering his problems with alcohol, and in displaying the courage to persevere with unpopular policies. But, at some point, perseverance becomes emotional stubbornness.
PALO ALTO – The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), it seems, cannot win.
In reality, the trade imbalance reflects the difference between China’s large savings surplus and the even bigger US saving deficiency (largely explained by the US fiscal deficit).
For example, if an employer (particularly an exporter) fears future renminbi appreciation, he may hesitate to raise wages in line with productivity increases, in order to keep his costs under control.
Again, this would inevitably trigger hot-money inflows, with speculators taking advantage of the spread between Chinese interest rates and the near-zero, short-term rates in developed economies, thereby driving up the renminbi further (and creating yet more opportunities for speculation).
For now, if China tries to liberalize its financial markets, hot money will flow the wrong way – into the economy, rather than out.
Due to my activism, however, China refused to renew my passport.
Human rights need not take a back seat to doing business with China.
After he served his term, the same officials funneled government funds to hire 200 thugs to punish him further by keeping him confined to his house.
The oil price remained stable, but the ruble and the stock-price indices lost 30% in the subsequent 24 hours.
Thus, the CBR would be able to provide a massive pile of rubles to Rosneft at below-market rates. So why did the deal trigger a panic?
Given that the price of oil is likely to remain low, Asian financiers – even the Chinese – do not seem eager to refinance Russian companies, and sanctions are unlikely to be lifted, investors clearly wanted a bigger and bolder solution.
This immediately raised suspicion that the CBR delayed the interest-rate hike in order to complete the deal at the lower rate.
American foreign policy, for all its shortcomings, has underpinned political stability around the world.
Rule II: Concentrate on the Elephants
In the Middle East, the US confronts Iran, which seeks to expand its power by any means it can, to oust neighboring countries’ governments in favor of ideologically sympathetic forces, and ultimately to evict America from the region.
If Americans had to pay more for gasoline, they would use less of it.  With a high gasoline price, alternative sources of energy such as ethanol and alternative forms of transportation such as electrically powered automobiles would become commercially viable.
They then proceeded, following a script, to switch props and roles, the first nurse reading from the file, “Alexa Holmes, Type A blood,” and the second reading from the bag, “Type A blood.”
Might there be a causal relation between the Bush administration’s cavalier, if not hostile, attitude toward law and its dazzling inability to acknowledge mistakes and manage midstream readjustments? Could it be that a willingness to flout the law and circumvent the Constitution tends to produce not nimbleness, but obduracy and intransigence?
But excessive secrecy leads to scarce resources being diverted into wild-goose chases.
Running from Musharraf
A president’s modernizing vision degenerated into a dictator’s power-driven myopia.
Or so the US believed.
Musharraf, according to his lawyer’s depositions before the Supreme Court, plans to give up his uniform after the indirect presidential elections he scheduled for October 6.
Running in Place on Trade
In retrospect, it is easy to see why.
Of course, we might still have yielded to pressure for protectionist measures, especially as WTO rules leave open the possibility of such a response.
Were he to opt to close the Doha Round as it has been negotiated to date, he could become a general without any troops.
We could even call this the Obama Round.
The organizers of the exhibition stated that they wanted to attract attention to the new role of religious institutions in Russian life.
Followers promptly destroyed 150 billboards in Moscow.
In April 2003, the Duma voted to toughen the law against inciting religious hatred by adding prison terms of up to five years for offenders.
Almost none of the writers had seen the exhibition - most had signed form letters.
But, with Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority demanding its own state, and with Russia refusing to recognize UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari’s plan for conditional independence, the US is preparing to go it alone.
Spain and Cyprus with their worries over secessionist-minded regions, are worried by any possible precedent.
Russia’s supposed “peacekeeping troops” in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia’s other secession-minded region, have in fact protected their rebel governments.
Military projections by the US have repeatedly suggested that Azerbaijan would lose such a battle, even with newly purchased equipment and Turkish military support.
The world, it appears, is on the brink of Cold War II. Some even say that it has already begun.
Taking advantage of Russia’s weaknesses and the lack of a counterweight, they refused to heed warnings against claiming a monopoly on global leadership.
Yet we succeeded in ameliorating it – not just normalizing relations but ending the Cold War confrontation itself.
And, as different as they are, they share one key feature: none has a military solution.
Along the same lines, during Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev’s presidency, he called for the creation of a mechanism for European preventive diplomacy and mandatory consultations in the event of a threat to any state’s security.
Indeed, Russia’s leaders fundamentally misjudged the West’s intentions and created an entirely unnecessary confrontation that undermines both sides’ interests.
It was those countries’ ambitions, not some vendetta against Russia, that drove EU and NATO enlargement.
When I became Secretary General of NATO in 2009, I identified a strengthened relationship with Russia as a top priority.
This approach offers the best chance of bringing an end to the current confrontation, and compelling Russia to engage constructively with the West.
Indeed, traditional balance-of-power theory suggests that US primacy in power resources should be offset by a Sino-Russian partnership.
Last May, shortly after the annexation of Crimea, Russia announced a $400 billion deal to supply 38 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to China annually for 30 years, beginning in 2019.
Consider the demographic situation in eastern Siberia, where six million Russians live across the border from up to 120 million Chinese.
The Sino-Russian alliance in the twentieth century was a product of China’s weakness following World War II and at the beginning of the Cold War – and, even then, it lasted little more than a decade.
Scholars, think-tankers, and journalists (both Russian and foreign) joined political and business leaders to discuss Russia’s future.
The pessimists – mainly Russian historians – claimed that Russia would find it difficult, if not impossible, to overcome its legacy of autocracy.
The discussion about autocracy was inevitably bound up with others. Autocracy has been defended in Russia as necessary for empire.
The alternative view, championed by people such as Igor Yurgens, head of Medvedev’s favorite think tank, The Institute of Contemporary Development, is that democracy is the precondition for economic modernization.
Moreover, Medvedev’s main strategic goal must be to secure a second term as president.
Indeed, Russia’s decline may make it even more dangerous.
And its population is shrinking – not least because the average man in Russia dies at age 65, a full decade earlier than in other developed countries.
States in decline – think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 – tend to become less risk-averse and thus much more dangerous.
Others at the conference argued that the West should change the game by expelling Russia from SWIFT, the international framework for clearing bank payments.
Putin left early, proclaiming that Western sanctions were harming European economies more than Russia anyway.
The new plants, like Iran’s first Russian-built reactor at Bushehr, would be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring and use only Russian-made nuclear fuel, which would be returned to Russia for storage to prevent Iran from developing dangerous nuclear technologies.
Moreover, the Kremlin has relaxed its opposition to Pakistan’s full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, along with China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
Why Russia’s Economy Will Not Collapse
Russia needed to borrow, and it was borrowing heavily in foreign currency.
The ruble’s free fall has been driven mainly by capital outflows.
The threat to Putin is clear.
None of this means that the West should bow and forsake its principles.
By adopting an aggressive, revisionist stance, Putin has made a historic and strategic mistake. Putin’s model should have been Peter the Great.
Whether he is seeking to weaken Ukraine or to enlarge Russia’s territory, Europe’s response must be firm.
The goal cannot be simply to contain Russia.
In its negotiations with Russia, Europe holds the stronger cards.
But Putin remains unprepared to act; in fact, so far, he has pretended that there is no crisis at all.
Though accurate and timely statistics on Russia’s economy – needed to guide effective measures to counter the crisis – are readily available to the public online, Putin claims not to use the Internet.
In short, Putin – who is no economic expert – makes all major economic policy decisions in Russia, delivering orders to top managers of state-owned enterprises and individual ministers in ad hoc, one-on-one meetings.
Suddenly, oil revenues are no longer sufficient to cover all three.
The Global Consequences of Russia’s Isolation
Last spring, the country’s foreign reserves amounted to a healthy $472 billion, helped by a substantial current-account surplus; and, according to the Central Bank of Russia, the country’s total foreign assets stood at $1.4 trillion, exceeding its liabilities of $1.2 trillion.
And when international security issues become salient, such as during the current Russian crisis, free movement of capital generates even greater volatility.
In short, the world order is being recast – and Russia is losing its place.
But his vague language reflected a larger hesitation that will probably persist until the crisis is over.
But serious conversations between the two men started last September, during Putin’s visit to Gdansk to mark the 70th anniversary of WWII’s start.
Faced with this situation, the Russian leadership sees both new dangers and new opportunities, which are often intimately interlinked.
Still, there are important caveats.
This is crucial.
The same could be said of the current conflict between Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the West: It is, at root, a collision between the West’s supposedly universal values and Russia’s quest for a distinct identity.
Putin knows that Russia’s reemergence on the global stage must be underpinned by a counterpoint to American exceptionalism, a national identity based on a distinct conception of history and distinct ideals.
In Putin’s view, the 1945 Yalta Agreement, which divided Europe into Soviet and Western spheres of influence, did not die; its borders simply moved eastward.
Russia does not need to upend the existing global order; it simply needs to find its place.
But it is impossible to contemplate the case without thinking that somehow, directly or indirectly, the path to assassination started near the Kremlin’s door.
In tough times, according to this view, one cannot choose one’s allies.
The forest of Russian flags provided a powerful symbol, a promise that another Russia was possible – and may yet still be.
“Is there a crisis in Moscow? No, there is no crisis.”
But neither Luzhkov, nor whoever may replace him, must worry about voter approval, as the Kremlin appoints Moscow’s mayor, rather than allowing for free and fair elections – a practice instituted a few years back by then-President Vladimir Putin for all such important positions across Russia.
The fires in the European part of Russia have destroyed 190,000 hectares of forest.
The burning summer of 2010 may help Russians to understand that their very existence depends on whether the authorities can provide assistance in times of emergency.
So far, Russian airstrikes have been concentrated in Latakia, Hama, and Idlib, where they have enabled Assad’s regime to make several advances.
Russia’s air force lacks the breadth of precision weapons and targeting systems fielded by the West – a reality that produced horrific consequences during the Georgian war in 2008 and the first and second Chechen wars in 1994-1996 and 1999-2009.
Military defeat, combined with worsening economic conditions, would likely turn much of the public – and more than a few of his cronies – against him.
Russia’s Indefensible Military Budget
Russia’s government was slow to accept reality, with President Vladimir Putin signing a revised budget only last month.
At this rate, its reserve fund will be emptied before the end of the year.
Moreover, its defense industry lacks the capacity to produce modern equipment as quickly as the plan anticipated.
The Cold War and the Cold Shoulder
Indeed, Russia’s reaction is consistent with its recurrent discourse about being “squeezed out” of its own neighborhood and “encircled” by hostile Western powers.
This geopolitical collapse occurred in part because Russians (not to mention their “captive nations” in Central and Eastern Europe) were seduced into believing that Western-style democracy and free markets worked better.
Its loss in the Crimean War of 1853-1856 led to the abolition of serfdom and other liberal reforms.
Indeed, the Soviet Union had a similar experience 40 years ago, when a protracted period of rising oil revenues fueled an increasingly assertive foreign policy, which culminated in the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.
With oil prices steadily rising, the value of Russian oil production reached a new peak, roughly ten times the 1999 level, in 2008; Russia invaded Georgia the same year.
President Vladimir Putin’s new Novorossya project simply cannot progress with oil prices at their current level.
Inflation shot up to 16%.
And while the Russian government singled out some enterprises as “strategic,” it actually gave them very little money.
Accomplishing this has required Putin to abandon some of his regime’s taboos.
Still, the significance of these changes should not be exaggerated.
So far, public reaction has been muted, but a two-week protest by Russia’s truck drivers over a new highway toll suggests that popular quiescence may not last.
Putin in the Dock
The judgment is the largest ever awarded by the arbitration court, and it cannot be appealed.
Indeed, it recently vetoed a Security Council resolution, sought by Malaysia, Ukraine, the Netherlands, Australia, and Belgium, to establish a criminal tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014 over rebel-occupied territory in eastern Ukraine.
Finally, while Russia has established de facto control of Crimea, it is likely to find itself increasingly embroiled in legal challenges to its presence there.
Putin may have been able to bring his country’s legal system under his control, but he remains vulnerable to international rulings.
Contemporary Russians consume competitive products: Nestle cereals, Mercedes cars, Hollywood movies.
Mortgages are available at outrageously high interest rates.
Foreign managers don’t seem to mind.
Scientists go on trial for technical espionage, while ex-KGB spies sign multi-billion dollar contracts.
Many Westerners eagerly pay more for “Fair Trade” coffee.
With huge current-account and budget surpluses, it had accumulated international reserves of $600 billion by July.
By recognizing the “independence” of the two occupied territories, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Russia turned the whole world against it.
As the stock market dives, they receive margin calls and are being forced to sell their shares at ever-lower prices, causing the stock market’s downward spiral to accelerate.
A reasonable guess would be that Moscow’s astronomic real-estate prices will fall by at least two-thirds.
The villain in this drama is Vladimir Putin, who has thrived on eight years of rapid growth generated by the market reforms of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
Russian capitalism hates the consumer as much as Russian communism did.
Moscow nowadays has all the trappings of high-end capitalism: Prada, Fouchon, Rolls Royce.
But perhaps the authorities are right to want to keep us in line.
Soviet socialism thought its citizens unworthy of any form of service altogether; Russian capitalism doubts that you can control your appetites, so it wants to control them for you.
The resulting empire will be liberal, according to Chubais’s definition, because it can be built with money rather than tanks.
Russia’s main foreign policy instrument in Georgia is Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly.
When the Georgian authorities announced plans to privatize the Inguri Power Plant and renew construction of the long-stalled Khudoni Power Plant, slated to become Georgia’s largest, RAO UES immediately began staking out a dominant role for itself in both projects.
In eternal Russia, nothing changes when it comes to monetary management.
It is inevitably a long road from a starting point where credits are channeled to state-owned enterprises through state-owned banks to an economic environment in which interest rates are a proper indicator of monetary policy.
Of course, many central banks around the world pursue both price stability and growth.
Today’s Kremlin thinks that democracy was being built too quickly in Russia.
Never would the law in its current form have passed through the old State Duma.
I firmly believe that we should not allow ourselves to participate in these games, nor that we should believe that Russia’s fascist organizations don’t have anything to do with the government.
We should not lose heart, but we do need to be politically active and united.
There is concern about Russia’s future, how it will use its newfound power, and how the West should respond.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared in 2005 that “the fundamental character of regimes matters more today than the international distribution of power,” and Senator John McCain, a US presidential candidate, has urged removing Russia from the Group of Eight advanced countries.
Riding on record-high energy prices and raw material exports, in January 2007 Russia became the world’s tenth-largest economy.
Finally, while one can understand a former superpower’s temptation to seize its opportunity to return to a muscular foreign policy, Russia’s bullying in the energy area is destroying trust and undercutting Russia’s soft power in other countries.
Yet none of this amounts to a fundamental change in Russia’s strategy, because Russia continues to adhere to its fundamental decision, made in the early 1990’s, to open itself to the West.
Theoretically, there remain different parties, elections, a pluralistic society, an independent judiciary, and a market economy.
The most important aspect of this will be to secure real judicial independence.
Above all, the European Union and its member states cannot allow Russia to recapture its imperial spheres of influence without severely damaging its own central interests.
Whether or not their relationship is in fact neighborly, rather than tense and confrontational, is of critical importance to both.
A look beyond the cordial rhetoric reveals profound differences.
Russia certainly pursues economic interests with its gas-export policy – all the more so when gas prices are trending down – and it wants to expand its role on the European gas market to intensify the dependencies that now exist.
Once those aims are achieved and/or Nabucco goes ahead, South Stream will be shelved because it doesn’t make economic sense.
In particular, the Russian utility giant Gazprom uses increases in gas prices as a means to punish “disobedient” neighbors.
Ethnic Georgians living in Russia, including those who are Russian citizens, became targets of persecution.
With Gazprom having already doubled gas tariffs for Georgia, the energy noose is tightening.
So once again Russians must face how ineffective their military is.
It suggested, instead, that the army should play a secondary role in anti-terrorist operations.
It is now obvious that overwhelming numbers don't provide an advantage in fighting terrorism, because it is the terrorists who have the initiative.
But neither Russia's president nor its power ministries seem ready for this.
In 2004, she was arrested and, in 2006, sentenced to six and a half years on embezzlement and tax fraud charges.
When Dmitry Medvedev was elected as Russia’s president a little more than a year ago, he promised to do away with the “legal nihilism” in Russia.
So the authorities’ aim seems clear: put Khodorkovsky and Lebedev away for a much longer time – more than 20 years if they are convicted.
It was his ambition to subject the country to truly far-reaching social and political reforms that sealed his downfall and also brought about this new trial, which appears intended to silence him for good.
Russia’s illegal occupation of the south Kuril Islands began on August 18, 1945, three days after Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration (or the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender), which ended the Pacific War.
Hatoyama is the grandson of Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, who signed the Japanese-Soviet Joint Declaration on October 19, 1956, which formally restored diplomatic relations between two countries and also enabled Japan’s entry into the United Nations.
But it is not only Japan that needs a government that takes regional security issues seriously.
Russia’s somewhat archaic political culture overly personifies power.
The real historical significance of the choice that Russia will face in 2008 will be determined not by the next president’s personal qualities, but by his loyalties – that is, to whom he owes his job.
But freedom and democracy do restrict arbitrariness and theft, and encourage politicians, regardless of their moral qualities, to take public interests into account.
Who loved this woman and why did he want everyone to know of his passion? Rumors had it that one of Russia's richest men wanted to impress his sweetheart.
The billboards with their private messages were able to occupy public space so easily because in Russia public space is virtually empty: there's very little, if any, communication between state and society, and barely any public debate.
Instead, political life here has been reduced to mere formality.
No professional solidarity was shown back in 2001, when Russia's private national television network NTV was taken over by the government.
Did Khodorkovsky write the letter, or had he merely signed it?
Whereas China intends to seduce and impress the world by the number of its Olympic medals, Russia wants to impress the world by demonstrating its military superiority.
For it is clearer than ever that Vladimir Putin is still in charge.
But Russia is not interested in joining, at least not on Europe’s terms.
The current crisis in the Caucasus does not mark the return of the Cold War, nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between Russia and the West; it is, more simply, the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the Russian Empire more than a century ago.
President Dmitri Medvedev’s approval ratings are only slightly lower.
The perennial Russian order – the dominant state and a powerless, fragmented society – remains largely in place.
The non-intrusive nature of the government is appreciated: people eagerly engage in their private affairs – with little regard for the political realm, which they have willingly abandoned.
For now, at least, provincial Russians and the new urban class alike have accepted Putin’s no-participation pact.
Worse, might Russia turn this weapon on an energy-addicted EU? That a German ex-chancellor is going to lead the company that could provide Russia with a means to manipulate the EU economy is testimony to Europe’s dangerous complacency in the face of Putin’s neo-imperialist ambitions.
As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania, I frequently endured such threats.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have been taught by our legacy that behind Russia’s every diplomatic act lurks imperial ambition.
But the problem is not so simple. The United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada have all seen declining birth rates as well.
By contrast, Solzhenitsyn, Tolstoy, and other writers in Russia’s great literary tradition fully understood this responsibility.
MOSCOW – Ramzan Kadyrov, the president of Chechnya, recently proposed to Ahmed Zakaev, a leader of the nationalistic and comparatively moderate Chechen opposition, that he return to Chechnya.
But the Kremlin wants to avoid this, owing to Kadyrov’s growing power and its general unease with a Russian Muslim elite that, while formally acknowledging Russian suzerainty, increasingly demands a redistribution of power within the Russian Federation.
Kadyrov seemed an effective antidote to the jihadists.
But he maintained that Islam is an essential part of the Chechen tradition and presented himself as a leader who fully understood this.
Mounting authoritarianism in Russia and Ukraine’s Orange Revolution seem to have ended the honeymoon the two men had enjoyed.
This turn of events is confusing.
Indeed, a chill is settling over Russia’s relations with the West more broadly.
But we placed amateurs in charge of dealing with Ukraine – amateurs with far-reaching commercial interests. When Putin was dragged in to cover up the mess, an ordinary failure turned into a total fiasco.
But the outside world’s assessment of Russia’s policies and prospects are visibly changing for the worse.
In fact, Putin’s “but” renders his points senseless.
The Dissenters Marches, which take place on the 31st of every month (article 31 of the Russian constitution guarantees freedom of assembly), could be (and are) easily dismissed as a marginal protest of a few hundred people with no common goals or ideas.
The best brains in Russia –engineers, scientists, and inventors – will gather in one place, and from there begin moving the country forward.
Journalists are killed, scientists are accused of espionage, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky remains unjustly imprisoned.
Similarly, in a country where the concepts of democracy and freedom are balanced by “but,” achievements in science, technology, and economy are not possible.
Suspense seems to be building around how Bush and Putin will greet each other when they meet in St. Petersburg.
Even so, Putin does seem genuinely popular among a public longing for a leader who can anchor their country without sinking it.
Indeed, many of the elderly in rural Russia are forced to sustain themselves by growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to till.
Indeed, historians have counted as many as 25 such cycles since the reign of Tsar Ivan III.
Third, the soaring price of oil has made the Kremlin’s inhabitants believe that they are all-powerful.
The real threat is to the Putin model of a corporate, authoritarian state, unfriendly to the West.
Indeed, the weakened Russia that will be Putin’s legacy will then also lose the Northern Caucasus and the Volga region to their growing Muslim populations.
Unwilling to see their boys die for the Donbas, they will form an anti-war movement that will force him to rein in his territorial ambitions.
That is why the Kremlin has repackaged derogatory historical terms like “Nazis” to refer to Ukraine’s current political elites.
Indeed, only a small portion of the middle class attended the protests that gathered force in late 2011 and early 2012, most of them concentrated in Moscow.
On the contrary, the ice is expanding.
After months of empty promises by separatist leaders, the citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk are unlikely to acquiesce quietly to Donbas’s transformation into another internationally isolated pariah entity that benefits Russia-based criminal networks.
For their part, Ukrainian rebel leaders, loath to lose their newly acquired fiefdoms, are lobbying fervently against any rapprochement between the Russian and Ukrainian governments.
By annexing Crimea, he lost Ukraine.
Two matters – besides the shaky global economy – are especially important for the G-8 summit.
Following on this progress, at the end of 2010, the Russians agreed to study the possibility of cooperating with NATO on anti-missile defense.
For Obama, success would vindicate the Nobel Peace Prize that he was awarded in 2009.
Last month, Gazprom announced its intention to cease shipments through Ukraine when the contracts with the country's gas pipeline company, Naftogaz, expire in 2019.
Gazprom receives two-thirds of its hard-currency revenues from Europe, and a period of falling exports and domestic economic crisis is not the ideal time to play games with your best customer.
We're paying on time, and we're paying in hard currency. So I think we should be treated accordingly."
WASHINGTON, DC – When Russian President Vladimir Putin presides over the military parade commemorating Victory in Europe Day on May 9, he will not attract the crowd he could have expected a couple of years ago.
The Nazi-Soviet pact, which carved up Poland and Romania between the Soviet Union and Germany, has been swept under the rug.
Meanwhile, Ukraine’s neighbors are left feeling vulnerable, worried that Russia’s efforts to destabilize the region may cross yet another border.
WASHINGTON, DC – Ukraine’s economy may no longer be in free fall, but it remains in dire straits.
Last year alone, Ukraine’s exports to Russia – which included machinery, steel, agricultural goods, and chemicals – fell by half.
Russia’s apparent but undeclared aim is to make sure that democratic Ukraine fails, without looking entirely guilty of having caused that failure.
Ukraine’s stabilization program with the International Monetary Fund is sound but underfunded.
Russian Realities
But how much will it matter?
Nor will any posture succeed that seeks to put Russia forward as a geopolitical counterweight to the United States.
Its voice should be heard on matters ranging from terrorism and weapons proliferation to global climate change and energy policy.
His peace overture to Israel stunned the Middle East.
This alliance was so vital an objective for Sadat that one may rightly wonder what came first in his strategy.
Leaders, more often than not, are hostage to the socio-political environment that produces them, rather than its shapers.
Through his visit to Jerusalem, Sadat shook away Israel’s siege mentality and gave psychological living space to an otherwise claustrophobic nation in the midst of a hostile Arab world.
Most egregious was the post-invasion rush to “de-Ba’athification,” which eviscerated many of the country’s existing institutions.
Instead of recurring to an international forum, a devastating war was declared that went beyond deposing Saddam, wreaking damage on tens of thousands of civilians, and thus confounding the message of condemnation.
Although officially adopted in December 2003 by the Iraqi Governing Council, the IST’s statute was framed under contract to the US government and approved by L. Paul Bremer, the Coalition Provisional Authority’s Administrator.
According to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, this problem has ostensibly been “solved” by means of extracted confessions.
Furthermore, economic-policy changes and structural reforms that were enacted in the wake of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis significantly reduced the region’s vulnerability to financial shocks over the past decade.
For example, segmented production for global supply chains has stimulated trade in intermediate goods and promoted foreign direct investment.
And, to address volatile capital flows, countries should increase exchange-rate flexibility, maintain adequate international reserves, and implement carefully designed capital controls.
Remaking Iran
Though Rouhani has made little headway combating rampant inflation, small business and the entrepreneurial middle class seem to be thriving.
Thus, he described the regime instituted by Khomeini as a religious democracy in which all high state offices, including his own, derive their legitimacy from the will of the people as expressed in elections.
The IRGC’s commander, General Mohammad Ali Jafari, has publicly expressed his hostility to Rouhani’s administration, while General Hassan Firouzabadi, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, has countered by expressing his support for the president.
That brief conversation – the first between the two countries’ presidents since 1979 – recalls the last attempt to revive bilateral diplomacy, undertaken 12 years ago by Iran’s then-President Mohammad Khatami.
There had been earlier attempts to improve relations with the Americans.
The aggressive rhetoric of Clinton’s successor, George W. Bush, who called Iran part of an “axis of evil” prior to the US-led invasion of Iraq, made Khamenei apprehensive, and he endorsed an initiative for a dialogue with the Americans in 2003.
CAMBRIDGE – Not long ago, a Harvard colleague wrote to me that Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of Libya’s dictator, would be in town and wanted to meet me.
These scholars have been pilloried in the media in recent weeks for supposedly having cozied up to Qaddafi.
And yet few would deny that China’s is a repressive regime that deals with its opponents harshly.
Most moral philosophers would say that helping the hostages is the right thing to do in this instance, even if doing so also helps the terrorist.
PRINCETON – Ten years after her death, Princess Diana still has star power.
Margaret Evans, a British researcher, studied tributes people left for Diana after her death and found that some referred to her as a saint, or an angel, and a few compared her directly with Jesus.
As she went through a messy divorce triggered by an unfaithful husband, millions of women shared her pain.
If you can convince yourself that everyone behaves selfishly, then why try to be a better person?


यह विरोध देश की अक्सर तिक्ततापूर्ण विभाजनकारी राजनीति में भी परिलक्षित होता है। हर खेमे ने दो दुर्जेय महिला नेताओं के नेतृत्व में, बारी-बारी से सरकार को नियंत्रित करने को कोशिश की है: वर्तमान प्रधानमंत्री, अवामी लीग की शेख हसीना वाज़ेद, और उनकी दो-अवधियों की पूर्ववर्ती, बांग्लादेश नेशनलिस्ट पार्टी की बेगम ख़ालिदा ज़िया।
इसे ऐसा करना जारी रखना चाहिए। आज़ाद बांग्लादेश के "राष्ट्रपिता", शेख मुजिबुर रहमान जिनकी 1975 में हत्या कर दी गई थी, की बेटी - हसीना - जानती हैं कि इस्लामवादियों के साथ समझौता करने से वे कहीं की नहीं रहेंगी; वे उन्हें कभी भी स्वीकार्य नहीं होंगी। उनकी सरकार को सुशासन के नाम पर (या राजनीतिक अस्तित्व की ख़ातिर) चरमपंथियों को संतुष्ट करने के प्रलोभन का शिकार नहीं होना चाहिए।
The Kurds have never sought to achieve democratic goals through violence.
This is the case for people of all ethnic or religious communities in the Kurdish regions.
Yet, despite consistently demonstrating a commitment to democracy, the international community has been deaf to our appeals.
But since the 1960’s, the passions expended until then on righting collective wrongs have been increasingly channeled into securing the rights of humans as individuals. Indeed, if the West can be said to have a public philosophy nowadays, it is a philosophy of human rights.
It is simply unfair to withhold the status of marriage from those who want to make this public vow.
Families are having fewer and fewer children, and more and more children are born out of wedlock.
MOSCOW – Last spring, after Russia annexed Crimea and began intervening in eastern Ukraine, the United States and the European Union introduced sanctions against Russian individuals and businesses.
In all of these cases, Putin acted on the conviction that Russia’s oil wealth meant that rules – even international laws – did not apply to him.
In other words, Ukraine is merely a breakaway region of historical Russia.
Even more important, the West should make it clear that it extends its definition of Europe not just to Russia’s borders, but across them.
But this time it has.
Its successor, the National Development and Reform Commission, will probably function more as a think tank – providing ideas and ensuring policy coherence, but with no power to allocate.
Although the service sector was able to generate growth in the past, it has proved to be a poor job creator and only employs 27% of workers, far lower than its share of the economy.
Mobilizing these savings will require careful thinking about how the domestic financial system can be expanded by an order of magnitude without risking a future crisis.
China has long run large surpluses.
It was also true of the two Bretton Woods arrangements, in which the US ran the necessary deficits.
China currently saves and invests half of its GDP, but, as its workforce shrinks in the coming years, its investment rate is likely to fall sharply.
If the US is unable or unwilling to run the required deficits, the global economy will flounder in a savings glut of low demand and cheap capital until another alternative emerges.
The Ifo business climate indicator, which had been rising since the second half of 2005, reached its highest level since Germany’s unification boom.
Some are doing very well, indeed.
As the world’s second largest exporter, the German boom was initially driven by foreign sales.
Despite the boom, and despite various programs that stimulated part-time employment, unemployment in absolute terms was about 4.5 million in 2006 and will be 4.1 million in 2007, compared to the last low point of 3.9 million in 2000.
First, the military released a statement that the girls had been released, then retracted the statement when it was found to be untrue, deepening public outrage.
But there is precious little that they can do – and they should not have to do anything.
And the #ChildNotBride protests forced the National Assembly to defend its decision not to remove from the constitution Section 29.4(b), which states that any married woman, regardless of her age, qualifies as an adult, allowing her husband to compel her to renounce her rights as a Nigerian citizen.
Sarko v Sego At Last
With 31% of the vote he will come to the second ballot in a very favorable position.
The fourth winner, though his absence from the second ballot is a disappointment for him, is François Bayrou.
The key strategic move for the two remaining candidates will be to attract the votes of the Center without losing their core Leftist or Rightist constituencies.
To succeed, Nicolas Sarkozy will have to turn his campaign slogan “Together everything becomes possible” into reality.
And yet he is the least popular of the Fifth Republic’s presidents, the one whose “fall from grace” with the French has been the most spectacular, rapid, and durable, to the point where political experts, and his friends and foes alike, wonder whether he can rebound.
Of course, there is an element of deeply unfair subjectivity in this perception.
The left remains in disarray, caught between its internal feuds and the rise of anti-capitalist extremism at its margins.
The euro is gaining ground for several reasons.
It gives comfort to ECB critics like Sarkozy, and otherwise puts pressure on them to drop the central bank’s inflationary bias because of its effect on the euro.
The longer the ECB maintains its inflationary bias, the steeper the consequent economic decline as the economy crumbles under the weight of the skyrocketing euro and interest rates that are too high for current economic realities (though lower than where the ECB hawks had planned to go before the current financial crisis hit).
Winston Churchill’s famous denunciation of the delaying tactics of the British and French on the eve of World War II should be a warning to French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Two years, of course, is a long time in politics, and any predictions today about the presidential vote in 2012 would be imprudent.
Too much state is not the answer to a locally failed state.
PARIS – In 2003, France, under President Jacques Chirac, took the lead in opposing America’s planned invasion of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.
For him, this is what power is about: taking hard decisions under unfavorable circumstances.
And not only is Qaddafi truly bad, but Libya is comparatively small, and his forces appear relatively weak (this remains to be proven on the ground).
And today, with France taking the lead in an international effort to protect the Libyan people from their leader, they can feel simultaneously proud of being French and of their Arab roots.
It described an elaborate spider’s web of committees, councils, and agencies with overlapping responsibilities, unrepresentative memberships, and inadequate enforcement powers – a system built up incrementally over decades, with no guiding architectural hand or central authority to promote coherent global regulatory standards.
A “board” sounds more impressive, authoritative, and permanent than a mere “forum.”
The International Monetary Fund, for example, has always resented the FSB, arguing that the Fund itself should be the monitor of systemic risk – and thus serve as the de facto global financial regulator. But the IMF’s arguments have been weakened by a recently published report by its own evaluation office, highlighting the Fund’s failure to identify emerging risks in the run-up to the crisis.
They could be co-located in a regulatory Tower of Babel in Basel.
PARIS – A year ago, when Nicolas Sarkozy was campaigning for the French presidency, he promised a “rupture” with the past.
But, although Sarkozy may not have sold his party on the merits of George Bush’s America, he has softened its once habitual suspicions about the US.
Although Mitterrand did stand firm with the US on the stationing of Pershing missiles in Europe in the early 1980’s, which won him respect from President Ronald Reagan, by this point the Gaullist consensus on the fundamentals of French foreign policy had spread across all political groups.
Speculators could have “front run” the bank in the markets, selling short, driving equity prices down, and forcing the French financial institution to sell into a bottomless pit.
In this changed political environment, Sarkozy is not likely to go after someone like Noyer who, as Bank of France Governor and a member of the ECB’s Governing Council, is widely viewed as a stalwart against inflation and a defender of French purchasing power.
Foreign bank mergers have proved poisonous for euro-zone central bankers.
France ’s re-integration into NATO is, in fact, the final stage in a process that has seen the French military play an increasingly important role in the alliance’s operations.
France’s full engagement will increase the pace of reform in NATO and make the alliance a tool better adapted to twenty-first-century crises by paring down its cumbersome bureaucracy.
If that were the case, Sarkozy’s decision, regardless of the advantages to NATO or France, would clearly be open to question.
Sarkozy's decision has put France in a position to gain influence in the alliance and increase the pace of NATO’s reform, while at the same time strengthening the ESDP.
But just when these countries were beginning to achieve success, the US shale revolution emerged, threatening all three of their main strategic objectives.
After all, game theory dictates that, once the surplus is eliminated, the dominant producer must prevent oil prices from rising high enough to cause it to lose market share again. That means that Saudi Arabia will try to compel non-OPEC countries, mainly in North America, to keep oil-production increases commensurate with growth in global demand.
The enthusiasm is obvious, and the campaign is already under way and highly spirited.
This pressure for change has been building for years.
The fact that most of the perpetrators of the attacks were identified as Saudis highlighted the country’s backward realities and provoked mounting international pressures for change.
BEIRUT – On February 24, violent confrontations between Shia pilgrims and the Saudi religious police and security forces occurred at the entrance to the Prophet Mohamed’s Mosque in Medina.
The violence outside the Medina mosque has led to unprecedented demonstrations in front of Saudi embassies in London, Berlin, and The Hague, with protesters demanding independence from the Saudi state.
Only by transforming Saudi Arabia’s currently monolithic Saudi/Wahhabi national identity into a more inclusive one will the Kingdom become a model that is attractive to its minorities.
Saudi Arabia’s Shia, an economically and politically marginalized community, staged an unprecedented intifada in the towns of Qatif, Saihat, Safwa, and Awamiyya.
Saudi Arabia’s Phony War on Terror
From this perspective, Saudi Arabia’s surprise announcement of a 34-country anti-terror alliance, with a joint operations center based in Riyadh, is a logical step, aimed at blunting growing Western criticism, while boosting Sunni influence in the Middle East. But, of course, the alliance is a sham – as a closer look at its membership makes clear.
A smaller Saudi-led Arab coalition has been bombing Yemen since March, with the goal of pushing back the Shia Houthi rebels who captured Sana’a, the capital, after driving the Saudi-backed government from power. Saudi warplanes have bombed homes, markets, hospitals, and refugee camps in Yemen, leading critics to accuse the Kingdom of deliberately terrorizing civilians to turn public opinion against the Houthis.
American policy is based overwhelmingly on the idea that Africa can lift itself out of extreme poverty through its own efforts, that aid is largely misused because of corruption, and that the United States already gives generous amounts.
Third, Africa is economically isolated, owing to very poor infrastructure, large over-land distances, and many landlocked countries.
Indeed, America’s own Millennium Challenge Account has already recognized such African countries for their strong governance.
In addition, Africa needs help with anti-malaria medicines, diagnostic equipment, and training of community health workers.
Emerging markets’ external and fiscal positions have been stronger than ever, thanks to the hard lessons learned from their own crisis-prone history.
Both economies have experienced currency crises within recent memory – South Korea in 1997-1998 and Brazil in 1999 – and both subsequently took steps to increase their financial resilience.
South Korea is hugely dependent on exports to advanced countries, Brazil much less so. 
If necessary, the IMF can issue special drawing rights (SDRs) to generate the global liquidity needed.
The priority for now is to save the emerging markets from the consequences of Wall Street’s financial follies.
So now is the time to build, not disrupt or impede, the international institutions that will manage our response to global climate change in the years ahead.
Assuming that annual per capita income grows at about 2% per year worldwide, a marginal expenditure of roughly $70 today to cut carbon emissions would be worth it if, accounting for damage from global warming and adjustment costs, the world of 2100 would be $500 richer in year-2006 purchasing power.
Saving Central America
In Guatemala, the major criminal organizations have long been embedded in the state, making gangs more of a vehicle of social mobility than anything else.
Guatemala receives as much as 10% of its national income from expatriates, usually in the US.
Originally financed by the European Union and others involved in the 1996 peace agreements, which ended 36 years of civil war, CICIG aimed to aid in the investigation and prosecution “of the crimes committed by members of the illegal bodies of security.”
Such institutions, together with the billion dollars that the US promised to the three countries last year, could help put them on the path toward stability.
In short, we are now witnessing a stunning concentration of power that is unprecedented in French republican history.
Moreover, France’s rapidly worsening foreign-trade deficit is boosting already-excessive debt levels, while output is falling and unemployment is rising.
Europe has succeeded in missing this goal for a half-century; now it has no choice but to shoot straight.
GENEVA – As 2015 begins, the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are under threat.
The failure to reflect the changing balance of global power brought about by the rise of China, Brazil, South Africa, and other emerging countries undermines both the effectiveness and the legitimacy of today’s international system, particularly in the eyes of those who feel denied of proper recognition.
They can no longer stand on the sidelines, denouncing the injustices of the past.
But why did Obama fence himself in with such rhetoric in the first place? Why this particular red line?
Mao Zedong was responsible for the deaths of more than 40 million Chinese in the 1950’s and 1960’s.
Hundreds of thousands?
No one is going to shoot missiles into China or Russia for the sake of upholding human rights or international standards of warfare.
This is the view of many people in Syria, even among the rebels.
These questions are crucial not only for France, because we are five months away from a French presidency of the European Union that should have been an important step in Europe’s own rebound.
Of course, if the international economic environment had been more favourable, and if there were not so much legitimate concern about declining purchasing power, the French might have shown greater indulgence towards their young president.
Despite some troubling similarities between Sarkozy and Vladimir Putin, French democracy is not in danger.
Annual output per person, adjusted for price levels in different parts of the world, averages around $10,000, implying total output of around $67 trillion.
This view has some truth.
Looking ahead, the world economy will need to introduce alternative technologies that conserve energy, water, and land, or that enable us to use new forms of renewable energy (such as solar and wind power) at much lower cost than today.
But if the world cooperates on the research, development, demonstration, and diffusion of resource-saving technologies and renewable energy sources, we will be able to continue to achieve rapid economic progress. 
The question for Egypt is whether the agenda of a truly pluralistic democracy – proclaimed by the avant-garde young protesters at Tahrir Square, the admirably self-empowered Facebook and Twitter generation – can prevail against the resilient forces of the past.
The masses called for a revolution, while the army conducted its own coup d’etat in the hope of saving what is essential in the system while sacrificing the man who embodied it.
But the regime that emerges is bound to be more attuned to local conditions, and thus to religion’s vital role in the social fabric.
Saving the Greek Sinner
The Greek disaster was possible because its government deceived its European partners for years with faked statistics. In order to qualify for the euro, the Greek government asserted that its budget deficit stood at 1.8% of GDP in 1999 – well below the 3%-of-GDP limit set by the Maastricht Treaty.
According to OECD statistics, pensions in Greece, available after only 15 years of work, reach an incredible 111% of average net incomes.
Greece’s public debt was placed in its own banking system, which is indebted to the European Central Bank via the issuance of euros.
This spring, before the first big issues of new Greek debt must be launched, the world will see which solution Europe has chosen.
Indeed, the share of government in employment in Scandinavia is surprising.
Prompted by capital flows to low-wage countries, specialization, outsourcing, and even immigration, the equilibrium price of unskilled labor has fallen throughout the western countries.
Edmund Phelps, this year’s Nobel laureate in economics, has also long advocated it.
In the United States, both Hillary Clinton and John McCain took the easy way out, and supported a suspension of the gasoline tax, at least for the summer.
Meanwhile, the financial sector failed to create products that would help ordinary people manage the risks they faced, including the risks of home ownership.
Given the huge increase in inequality in most countries, higher taxes for those who have done well – to help those who have lost ground from globalization and technological change – are in order, and could also ameliorate the strains imposed by soaring food and energy prices.
China’s Flawed Balance-of-Payments Position
In 2008, US corporations gained a 33% return on their investments in China, while other multinationals got a 22% return.
A country in the later stages of development can use investment income from its past accumulation of net foreign assets to compensate for the decline in citizens’ incomes due to aging and other changes.
In fact, this investment will never be repaid in full, so a large write-off is inevitable.
Now it looks as if the Asian approach may take some knocks, too.
But such criticism ignores the problems faced by banks that did not use or deal in complex financial products.
The fiscal problems of Greece and Spain were also the result of spending a great deal on high-technology and high-prestige projects: facilities for the Olympic Games, new airport buildings, high-speed train links.
But soon they encounter their own banana peel; indeed, today’s global economy is a riot of slipping economic models.
A Generation Held Hostage?
It is believed that the girls have been split into separate groups, so that any attempt to rescue one group would imperil the others.
To support and encourage more girls to attend school in the face of abduction threats, the Nigerian Safe Schools Initiative has been launched to fund fortifications, telecommunications, and security measures aimed at allaying children’s fears about going to what should be a safe haven.
But there is a war of liberation that remains to be won worldwide – against child labor, child marriage, child trafficking, and discrimination against girls.
Moreover, the number of long-term unemployed (27 weeks or longer) is about 40% of the total – thelowest share since 2009, but still far higher than in the previous recessions since the Great Depression, and about double what it would be in a normal labor market. So the US labor market, while healing, is still far from where it should be.
This has fanned speculation that a “mismatch” between workers’ skills and employers’ needs is a significant factor behind the elevatedunemployment rate.
The US was the world leader in high school and college graduation rates for much of the twentieth century. Today it ranks in the middle of the OECD countries.
The best answer is both ancient and simple: hubris.
The problem is that, no matter how “scientifically” these new beliefs were formulated, they are still false.
If investing is simply a matter of allocating money to an index, however, liquidity becomes the sole determinant of prices, and valuations go haywire.
But a market is not a rocket, economists are not rocket scientists, and moral hazard is, in human affairs, the risk that matters most.
If we cleave to the false security of a supposed science that isn’t working, and forget about the philosophy behind it, ideas like personal responsibility and the right to fail, our leaders will very scientifically give us no recovery at all.
Empathy alone does not necessarily prompt pro-social behavior; empathizing with the suffering of another may not drive you to help that person.
After all, living in a world that assumes we are homo economicus can encourage selfish habits.
These models will enable us to make clear, testable predictions about expected monetary-exchange behavior in an economic context, including in addressing common-good problems.
It will include items such as the common agricultural policy, regional structural funds, and research and innovation.
Rather, it has shifted in a more urgent, complex, and inherently unforeseeable way, as spelled out in the EU 2020 strategy’s vision of an “Innovation Union.”
The ERC puts its trust into the researchers it funds to know where the ”frontier” of science is.
The “Impact” Illusion in Science
It depicted an elderly couple at the breakfast table.
Another quintessential example of both the synergy and serendipity of basic research is the origin of recombinant DNA technology, the prototypical technique of modern genetic engineering (sometimes called “genetic modification,” or GM).
Their goal was to learn more about the rates of cellular mutation and the generation of antibody diversity.
As officials decide how that money is to be spent, they would be wise to glance in the rear-view mirror and fund the basic research that keeps science moving forward.
We have a responsibility to make sure we fulfill the promise we made at the beginning of the millennium: to ensure that boys and girls everywhere complete a full course of primary schooling.
That is why we must also set targets for secondary education, while improving quality and learning outcomes at all levels.
Learners of all ages need to become familiar with new technologies and cope with rapidly changing workplaces.
This is the challenge that inspired Norway to invite world leaders to Oslo for a Summit on Education for Development, where we can develop strategies for mobilizing political support for increasing financing for education.
It is a right for disabled children, just as it is for everyone else.
Salah satu cara untuk memperbaiki pengumpulan data serta penggunaannya demi pembangunan berkelanjutan adalah menciptakan hubungan aktif antara penyediaan layanan dan pengumpulan dan pengolahan data dalam pengambilan keputusan.
Saat ini, angka penerimaan sekolah cenderung dihitung berdasarkan pendaftaran siswa pada awal tahun ajaran, meskipun kehadiran sebenarnya mungkin jauh di bawah angka pendaftaran.
Mengingat bahwa banyak indikator utama belum dikumpulkan secara real time, tetapi hanya melalui survei rumah tangga retrospektif yang melelahkan, indikator utama untuk tujuan pengentasan kemiskinan sudah kadaluarsa selama lima tahun bagi banyak negara.
Crowdfunding or Crowdphishing?
And that will not change without adequate – and innovative – financial regulation.
The economic equilibrium we live should be regarded, above all, as a phishing equilibrium, in which small-time individual dishonesty can morph into something more systemically important when it is carried on by business organizations under intense competitive pressure.
That’s why channeling dispersed knowledge into new businesses requires a regulatory framework that favors the genuinely enlightened and honest.
It should require that the intermediary sponsoring a platform install a surveillance system to guard against interference and shills offering phony comments.
Today, more than 90% are.
In the developing world, one girl in seven is married by the age of 15; nearly half become mothers by the age of 18.
Appropriate modifications could turn these into secondary schools for part of each day, bringing secondary education closer to children’s homes.
The world stands at a crossroads.
He also introduced a de-Baathification law, which evicted members of the Baath Party from official positions without legal recourse, paving the way for sectarianism and, ultimately, communal violence and unrest.
Making matters worse for ordinary Iraqis, public services have deteriorated to a dismal level, and unemployment is rising sharply, despite public expenditure in excess of $500 billion over the seven years of Maliki’s rule.
Given a new law limiting senior officials to two terms in office, we also hope to see new and accountable leaders in positions of power.
The report proposes two alternatives.
When they spoke of creating a new system of collective security they meant it in the traditional military sense.”
The Security Council would judge the legitimacy of such action by whether it met the age-old criteria of just war: the seriousness of the threat, the purpose of the response, whether force is a last resort, whether it is used in a proportionate way, and whether there is a reasonable balance of good and bad consequences.
In the case of the Iraq War, President Bush never established a broad consensus that might have provided legitimacy in the face of a veto.
After all, such solidarity is what allowed Europe to prosper and integrate over the past 50 years. So why not stick to a winning formula where energy is concerned?
A fundamental part of this must be serious consultation among member states on strategic decisions that may affect an EU partner.
The EU must continue to insist that Russia ratify it, stipulating that Russia is already bound by its terms.
Whether or not Goldman is guilty, the transaction in question clearly had no social benefit.
Ordinary securities must be registered with the SEC before they can be traded.
It will be the task of regulators to understand derivatives and synthetic securities, and to refuse to allow their creation if they cannot fully evaluate the systemic risks.
Moreover, the five big banks that serve as market makers and account for more than 95% of over-the-counter transactions in the US are likely to oppose the proposal, because it would hit their profits.
It is indeed hard to believe that Russia and China, in particular, would be accommodating.
The P5 have obligations under the UN Charter, as well as international humanitarian and human rights law, not to undermine the effectiveness of the UN or that body of law.
The other would be a request for veto-restraint by at least 50 member states, including at least five members from each of the recognized geographical groupings.
The French proposal, though still evolving, has already struck a responsive chord internationally.
This is more appropriate to the task of reducing carbon emissions than a single price, because there is a multiplicity of sectors and methods, each of which produces a different cost curve.
Meanwhile, conditions changed with the passage of time: China, following decades of booming growth, replaced the United States as the largest emitter.
When the trees are cut and peatlands drained, the carbon accumulated over millennia is exposed and oxidized – often in the form of fires that envelope neighboring Singapore and Malaysia in smoke.
These efforts can serve as a prototype for assisting other countries such as Guyana, where the current forest-preservation scheme does not work so well.
Indeed, the plethora of separate banking regulators had created opportunities for banks to arbitrage the system in search of a more indulgent approach to capital.
A fashionable approach was known as “twin peaks,” whereby one regulator handled prudential regulation – setting capital requirements – while another oversaw adherence to business rules.
Among the single-regulator countries, Singapore and the Scandinavians were successful in dodging most of the fatal bullets, while the UK evidently was not.
There were major overhauls in 1986, and again in 1997, when the Bank of England lost its banking supervision responsibilities as a delayed response to the collapse of Barings.
But there is no sign of a considered assessment being prepared, which might at least help countries to make better-informed choices, even if it did not conclude that one model was unambiguously best.
Even the tiny country of Montenegro has had a hopeful few years since it declared independence in 2006.
Other policymakers, however, see an even greater risk that postponing EU accession into the indefinite future could undermine the credibility of the declaration made at Thessaloniki.
None of them will want the European Commission to note that one country is doing better than another.
MELBOURNE – In April, Germany’s parliament placed limits on the use of genetic diagnosis.
In an attempt to mitigate this problem, the law specifies that anyone taking out an insurance policy valued at more than €300,000 may be required to disclose the results of prior genetic tests.
If the child does inherit it, he or she will, at around 40, begin to suffer uncontrollable movements, personality changes, and a slow deterioration of cognitive capacities.
But if we take that into account, should we not also take into consideration the life of the child who the parents would have had, if they had been able to use prenatal diagnosis and be sure of having a child who does not carry the gene for the disease? Surely that child has better life prospects.
Are social critics right to worry about the atomized loneliness of big-city life?
In both cases, despite objections to the ruling ideology’s specific tenets, few reject the ethos itself.
Urban pride – what we call “civicism” – is a key feature of our identities today.
China, the United States, and even Canada may take years to implement serious plans to address climate change. Yet cities like Hangzhou, Portland, and Vancouver take pride in their “green” ethos, and go far beyond national requirements in terms of environmental protection.
Practically all developing countries’ reserves are invested in developed countries’ assets, leading to an increasing net transfer of resources from the developing to the developed world, which, according to UNDESA estimates, reached $720 billion in 2007 alone.
Official development assistance and multilateral bank lending, though valuable, remain insufficient.
Assuming a ratio of loans-to-capital of 2.4 times – an estimate based on the ratio of the successful and financially sound Andean Development Corporation – the expanded regional and sub-regional development banks or new ones could generate additional lending of approximately $120 billion.
Passive data, as the name suggests, are not generated consciously; they are by-products of our everyday technological existence.
Given the dramatic growth in the amount of data being generated, together with ever-expanding applications across industries, it is reasonable to expect that individual data will soon be worth more than $100 per Internet user.
Presumably, they could sell that information directly to the organizations that want it, instead of allowing Facebook to do so.
Selling America
As a result, politics has become a contest about credibility.
Skeptics who treat “public diplomacy” as a euphemism for broadcasting government propaganda miss the point.
They can support the teaching of English and finance student exchanges.
That means that Condoleezza Rice’s chief task as Secretary of State will be to make American foreign policy more consultative in style as she seeks a political solution in Iraq and progress on Middle East peace.
But Shiller was wrong.
This takes nothing away from the importance of the question that Shiller addressed.
Send in the Clowns
Of course, comic entertainment in politics is not just a modern phenomenon.
The problem with many democratic politicians today is that they have become almost as dull as the old communist autocrats. Most, especially in Europe, are professional politicians with no experience apart from working the levers of party machines.
John McCain managed to defeat his more conventional Republican rivals by seeming to be totally different from them: a maverick who says what he damned well wants, a tough guy with the knowing wink of the old ladies’ man.
Senegal’s Democracy Put to the Test
Furthermore, since 2003 state schools offer religious instruction (using authorized textbooks that are never Wahhabi in spirit), with the informal approval of secular and Sufi teachers alike.
Wade has substantial international prestige, because he led the final phase of the country’s long democratic transition in 2000. But Wade postponed legislative elections, originally scheduled for June 2006, first to February 2007, and later, by presidential decree, to June 2007.
Whereas the US is willing to spend $147 billion next year in the name of an implausible democracy in Iraq, it refuses to spend any imagination or money to shore up one of the most creative models of peace and democracy in the Islamic world.
During a lecture at the Korea National University of Education four days later, he stoked tensions further, saying of the Emperor of Japan’s proposed visit: “If he wants to come, he should apologize first for the past.”
The origins of the dispute over Takeshima lie in the period immediately before the Treaty of San Francisco was signed in 1951, formally ending World War II in the Pacific.
Until this point, neither China nor Taiwan expressed objections.
By allowing social tensions to mount to such a degree, the Chinese government may also be partly responsible for the recent rampage among thousands of workers at the Foxconn plant (where components for Apple iPods and iPads are made) in Taiyuan.
But civilian deaths as a result of military combat are not enough to say that “disproportionate force” has been used.
However, this does not mean that force becomes “disproportionate” simply when the costs outweigh the benefits.
In the justification of armed conflict, everyone agrees that the defending state may use all necessary force to repel an aggressor.
First, in international conflicts, the defending army must always protect the lives of its citizens, not just property interests.
Journalists on the ground would do well to inquire about the relevant military objectives rather than pass judgment on the basis of the numbers of civilians killed, which may have minimal relevance to legal analysis.
The Lega Nord, led by the charismatic Umberto Bossi, holds the decisive votes in Parliament to keep the Berlusconi government afloat.
This proposal seems to have found a certain degree of support from Berlusconi, though he would likely be the only one in the country to agree with it.



Nikolic, whose party’s leader, Vojislav Seselj, is currently being tried for war crimes in The Hague, has campaigned on an anti-Western, Euro-skeptic, and openly chauvinist platform, exploiting the Kosovo issue at every turn and putting Tadic and other pro-Europeans on the defensive.
From the perspective of the European Union (and many liberal Serbs), this narrative has the familiar ring of jingoism, obsessive self-regard, and an enduring attachment to victimhood.
Putin’s Dilemma
But, after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Russia can no longer pursue a divide-and-rule strategy that leverages these differences.
These are large numbers even for Russia, with its currency reserves of $480 billion.
Over the last ten years, the question has been whether to keep the existing 18% value-added tax or replace it with a sales tax.
Consumption growth has been driven largely by Russia’s integration into the global economy – and cannot be sustained without it.
MEXICO CITY – The capture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán – one of the world’s most wanted criminals – is just one victory in the long fight against Mexico’s narcotics traffickers.
To be sure, a team of professionals leads Peña Nieto’s security cabinet; but other parts of this government are affected by the habits he acquired as Governor of the State of Mexico, the most populous of Mexico’s 31 states, which surrounds Mexico City.
She recorded part of a music video in the Michoacán Palace of Justice.
Although it is impossible to anticipate how Mexico’s many contemporary crises will end, we do know that in the coming years Mexico will continue to be characterized by a combination of solid macroeconomic numbers, chronic inequality, and structural violence.
Even regulators and industry experts are not aware of the true numbers of deaths and adverse events, due to the lack of proper reporting.
Trial subjects drawn from illegal Latin American immigrants were threatened with reporting of their illegal status to the US Department of Homeland Security if they complained about the risks of the drug that they received.
Advocates in the US, such as the ten-year-old human rights organization, Citizens for Responsible Care and Research (www.circare.org), which I co-founded, have proposed a universal National Human Subjects Protection Act.
And America’s decision to send Undersecretary of State William Burns to a meeting with Iran’s top nuclear negotiator suggests that those signals are being taken seriously.
In addition to far-reaching political and economic cooperation, the offer promises cooperation on nuclear matters, including the construction and supply of the newest light-water reactors in Iran, as well as Iranian access to nuclear research and development – provided that there is a negotiated settlement.
Iranian spokesmen also indicate that there is an official awareness of Israel’s importance for a comprehensive regional solution, and that doing business with Israel is no longer inconceivable.
Indeed, if a diplomatic solution fails, they are more likely to react more forcefully.
Granting balance-of-payments support has important fiscal implications, and it is natural that there should be continuing close oversight by those who ultimately provide the capital – the IMF’s member states.
The independent board members would constitute only a small minority, but their presence and professional expertise would give them disproportionate weight.
However, on financial matters (in particular the distribution of profits and losses), the voting rules are different: the Executive Board does not participate and the votes of the national central bank presidents in the Governing Council are weighted by their respective capital shares.
That is not just because vaccines are not readily available; it is also because women in these countries have limited access to screening and treatment.
Whether such attitudes and misinformation account for poor vaccine coverage in places like France and the US is still not known.
But, while HPV infection rates may be falling in some of these countries, are they falling fast enough?
Thus, one might infer that we face another seven years or so of bad times.
Likewise, many people have been wondering if the weakness that followed the equity and real-estate crash in Japan at the beginning of the 1990’s is relevant to our experience today.
Reinhart and Rogoff describe a “this time is different syndrome” during the pre-crisis boom, whereby these bubbles are allowed to continue for far too long, because people think that past episodes are irrelevant.
In that case perhaps all of those crisis-induced bad decades are no longer relevant.
Back then, Afghanistan’s people held great hopes for an immediately wonderful future.
It must be concentrated on the sanctuaries of those who train, equip, and motivate the extremists and send them out to hurt us all.
Unless we collectively address the roots of the problem by ending that support, as well as financial support for radicalism in all forms, we will not defeat terrorism.
Last year, I pardoned a 14-year-old boy from the Pakistan tribal area in Waziristan who had come to Afghanistan to blow himself up as a suicide bomber.
I said, “Why? Let him live here, let him work here, let him be an Afghan.”
On top of this historical foundation, we build our civilization.
As members of Vasily Chuikov’s 62nd Army, they grabbed hold of the nose of the Nazi army and did not let go.
The Allies probably would have eventually won World War II even had the Nazis conquered Stalingrad, redistributed their spearhead forces as mobile reserves, repelled the Red Army’s subsequent winter 1942 offensive, and seized the Caucasus oil fields, thus depriving the Red Army of 90% of its motor fuel.
ROME – Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s political and sexual exploits make headlines around the world, and not just in the tabloid press.
Since the 1990’s, his channels broadcast “Big Brother” and Italian variety shows dominated by male comedians, musclemen, and scantily clad young girls, popularly known as “veline.”
Nor are Italians reassured to learn that Berlusconi fielded a number of candidates during the recent European Parliament elections whose only discernible qualification was that they were pretty young girls who had possibly spent some time in the prime minister’s company at his Sardinian Villa or Roman Palazzo.
In the US, for example, President George W. Bush’s Patriot Act is being extended, following a series of backroom deals.
But now that public figures – especially those deemed to be “of interest” to intelligence agencies – are susceptible to being watched three-dimensionally, the chances of being compromised are far higher than they were in the days of the UK’s Profumo affair, which brought down a British defense secretary in the early 1960’s.
In the 1950’s, communism and the homosexual “threat” became wedded in the American public imagination.
Consider the official US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that revealed that State Department employees were asked to obtain “biometrics” on public officials at the United Nations.
“Generation consciousness,” unlike the “class consciousness” of old, is obviously not a defining factor in people’s political preferences.
This is a profound change that creates much friction in the transitional phase.
Advice ranges from sex in old age to tourism.
The impression of a generation on permanent holiday is deceptive in another respect.
Beyond that, the key feature of an aging society is the independence of the elderly.


Is Pakistan, a country long prone to military coups, finally developing a well-functioning political system?
By appointing a special tribunal to try Musharraf, the Sharif government is sending a strong signal to the military – particularly its senior commanders – that they are not above the law.
Unfortunately, unlike Sharif’s actions in Pakistan, this effort did not spur the development of a more stable political order.
Of course, the terms of the contract vary with place and time. In nineteenth-century Europe, the rich were expected to be frugal.
In the current crisis, popular anger is – no surprise – directed against bankers.
“Enrich yourselves” is the clarion call of our era; and in that moral blind spot lies a great danger.
They appear immovable until the moment they are evicted by popular anger.
The Western democracies will survive with only modest changes.
The rulers in Moscow and Beijing would do well to heed this warning.      
Making these reductions would cost about €200-350 billion annually by 2030 – less than 1% of projected global GDP in 2030.
Without carefully managing tropical forests – 90% of which grow in developing nations that have pressure to clear the land for other economic purposes – we cannot meet our global targets for reduced carbon emissions.
A developed nation cannot meet carbon emission targets by outsourcing its dirtiest production to a developing country, and a developing country cannot meet its targets by chopping down forests to build the plants or expand low-productivity agriculture.
When stressed, a big surface bifurcates in big chunks, but then the disintegration continues into smaller and smaller fragments.
The argument against European structures depends on hostility to a transfer union that might lead to some redistribution of resources.
It is now mired in an existential crisis more profound than at any point since 1945.
Share the Work
What is not well known, however, is that in the 1930’s, the United States, to a much greater extent than today, succeeded in mitigating these problems.
Second, legislation encouraged it.
In fact, the US already has something along these lines: a program known as Short-Time Compensation.
BONN – Sharks have long been portrayed as man-eaters, a menace to any swimmer brave (or foolish) enough to share the water with them.
Similarly, the shark-diving industry has brought in an estimated $110 million annually to Thailand, $22 million to the Canary Islands, and a massive $800 million to the Bahamas over the last 20 years.
Consider climate change.
It is time to launch concerted global efforts to protect some of the oldest, most vulnerable – and most valuable – species in our seas.
As one of the players at that summit, I understand the reason for the gap between what was agreed by the “moderates” and the harsh realities that have driven the “extremists” forward.
Abbas is being asked to play for high stakes – defeating Hamas and with it the cause of Islamic fundamentalism in the region – with inadequate resources.
The latest Sharm el-Sheikh summit is also a message to the Saudis: Cairo, not Mecca, is the center of Middle East politics.
In short, Sharon was the ideal center candidate: a leader who reconciled a dovish approach with a hawkish outlook.
On the left is Amir Peretz of the Labor party, a populist and trade-union federation leader with little national leadership experience and even less familiarity with security matters.
But in the upcoming elections, he is likely to be left out in the cold.
No one believes that Palestinian leader Abu Mazin can or will do anything to stop such attacks.
NEW DELHI – According to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters, his overwhelming victory in India’s general elections was a sweeping repudiation of everything for which the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, led by the Indian National Congress, stood. Will Modi live up to voters’ expectations?
This goal explains another policy reversal as well. The UPA’s critics long claimed that unsustainably low, state-dictated passenger fares and freight charges for rail services – which could not cover the cost of maintenance to ensure the safety of trains and tracks, much less enable expansion and improvement of service – reflected the government’s inability to make tough decisions.
The Modi government has also adopted the UPA-proposed Goods and Services Tax, which had been stalled by opposition from BJP-ruled states (including Modi’s Gujarat). And it will strengthen the national anti-terrorism effort, which Modi previously denounced as an assault on Indian federalism.
Both are frequent occurrences in Indian political life.
I suppose it is entirely possible that “Jayalalithaa” has attained political successes that might have eluded a mere “Jayalalitha.” But on what possible basis can it be argued that the addition of a superfluous vowel made all the difference?
There was one crucial difference from her Indian counterparts, though. When Singh, meeting Thatcher soon after she had become Prime Minister, whispered, “Our man was proved right,” her reaction surprised him.
Only democracy could have engineered such remarkable change with the consent of the governed, and enabled all to feel that they have the same stake in the country’s progress, equal rights under its laws, and equal opportunities for advancement.
But the complacency with which the political establishment accepts the disruption of Parliament suggests that even experienced politicians do not understand this.
India has never seemed likely to succumb to a similar tendency, but the irresponsible custodians of Indian democracy should not tempt fate.
Five years ago, India’s lunar mission, called Chandrayaan, was the occasion for another national celebration.
Yet, unavoidably, some triumphalism has crept into the narrative.
The Great War’s Forgotten Soldiers
They were killed in droves before the war entered its second year, and they bore the brunt of many German offensives.
The soldiers were all volunteers; soldiering was their profession, and they served the very British Empire that was oppressing their own people back home.
The British have been flocking to an exhibition showcasing Indian troops’ role; the French are making a film about the brown-skinned and turbaned men who fought to save their land from the Germans; and, in India, curiosity has overcome the fading colonial-era resentment of British exploitation.
NEW DELHI – The victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its leader, Narendra Modi, in India’s general election last month has raised a crucial question about the country’s future.
This is where critics deem the Congress party to have failed, focusing as it did on the needs of India’s poorest.
The alleged handouts empowered those with the least to stand on their own feet and seek to improve their lives.
India’s Democratic Pageant
Yet there are larger issues behind the electoral spectacle that must not be overlooked.
The significant changes in the social composition of India’s politicians and bureaucrats since Independence are indeed proof of democracy at work.
As the victors in May cobble together a government, their challenge will be to sustain a pluralist India of competing ideas and interests, unafraid of the power or products of the outside world, and determined to liberate and fulfill its people’s creative energies.
India’s mild-mannered Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that Khobragade’s treatment was “deplorable.”
Likewise, the police have removed bollards and barriers that the US Embassy had unilaterally placed on the street in front of its complex in New Delhi, creating an obstacle to free circulation on a public road that India had tolerated in a spirit of friendship.
In almost no other country are local labor laws applied in such a manner to a foreign diplomat’s personal staff.
India had handled American diplomats with a generosity of spirit that it felt the bilateral relationship deserved.
The principal obstacle to peace has been Pakistan’s sponsorship of militancy and terrorism within India, culminating in the horrific attacks in Mumbai in November 2008, in which terrorist commandos killed almost 200 people.
Singh sat down with Sharif after a series of incidents on the LoC led his critics to urge him not to proceed with the meeting.
The benefits of peace, for both sides, would be enormous.
A Taliban victory there, the advocates of the surge had warned, would radicalize the entire region and create a domino effect, with Islamic insurgencies unleashed across Central Asia.
Pakistan’s macabre association with the Taliban stems mostly from its constant effort to pressure its mortal enemy, India.
So, while the US gets to play the “Ugly American” once again, the regional powers promote their interests in that war-torn country with a smiling face and away from the battlefield.
If both war and diplomacy fail, these regional powers believe they will be better positioned than the West to shift the Afghan Great Game in their favor.
With a shrinking labor force, the standard estimate for Japan in 2012 –&#160;that is, before Abenomics – had output per employed worker growing by 3.08% year on year.
Kuroda’s stance has already weakened the yen’s exchange rate, making Japanese goods more competitive.
The real challenge will be in designing the third arrow, what Abe refers to as “growth.”
For example, Japan is in a good position to exploit synergies between an improved health-care sector and its world-class manufacturing capabilities, in the development of medical instrumentation.



Indeed, I believe that a framework under which Asian governments publicly disclose their military budgets needs to be established if we are to build trust and avoid a regional arms race.
No less important, when Japan sends hardware, experts and training follow, and we convey our sense of pride in committing ourselves to our duties.
The JSDF is now working to foster peace in South Sudan, under the flag of the UN mission there, alongside units from Cambodia, Mongolia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Republic of Korea, and China, as well as many civilian UN staffers and NGO personnel from various countries. All are partners with us in assisting South Sudan’s nation-building process.
If anything has changed, it is that women are much more visible among these new Japanese.
Mr. Abe Goes to Washington
In America’s view, the reinterpretation of Article 9 of Japan’s “peace constitution” that Abe undertook – thereby allowing Japan’s self-defense forces to aid allies under attack and to assist the US and other allies in meeting their commitments to securing Asia’s peace – was long overdue.
Japan in Action
But, following monetary easing and fiscal expansion, it is Abenomics’ third “arrow” that will prove most important – and most politically challenging.
Japanese diplomacy lost its footing in the unstable – and often naive – politics of the DPJ years.
TOKYO – As Shinzo Abe sits down this week in Seoul with South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, he does so as the leader of a country that many people around the world now seriously underestimate.
Its economy remains the world’s third largest overall, sustained by highly sophisticated industry.
Both are suspicious of Abe, who exacerbated tensions with nationalist rhetoric and a visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine early in his current administration.
In addition, he hopes to use the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to force reform of the inefficient agriculture sector.
Japan is a successful, comfortable society, which has much to contribute to the world.
Abe also stressed his intention to boost ties with Russia, promote cooperation with the ASEAN countries, and develop a strategic dialogue with Australia and India.
Furthermore, Abe will seek to reorganize the prime minister’s office to reinforce its ability to function as a political headquarters that can make quick decisions on national strategy concerning diplomatic and security issues.
If Abe is to create the “beautiful country” that he promised in his policy speech, he must not lose momentum in exercising strong leadership.
It is not that Abe’s 2012 campaign lacked ambition; he set out a bold economic-reform agenda and promised to boost Japan’s global influence. But, after two decades of leaders who – with the exception of Junichiro Koizumi – promised little and achieved less, Japanese voters had little reason to expect that Abe would follow through on his pledges.
Beyond his economic strategy, Abe has also delivered in terms of foreign policy.
If the Japanese public returns him to office, he will have the mandate he needs to complete his ambitious, pragmatic, and forward-thinking agenda. It is now up to the Japanese people to give him that mandate, effectively choosing to end two decades of economic malaise and geopolitical irrelevance.

इनमें से एक है हमारा ट्रैक रिकॉर्ड, जो "शांति के लिए सक्रिय योगदानकर्ता" होने की हमारी महत्वाकांक्षाओं का समर्थन करता है। जापान ने संयुक्त राष्ट्र और उसके संगठनों को वित्तीय योगदान अपने उचित हिस्से से कहीं अधिक किया है, ऐतिहासिक और वर्तमान दोनों दृष्टियों से। और हमारा वैश्विक उत्तरदायित्वों का विस्तार जापान की आत्म-रक्षा सेनाओं तक व्याप्त है। आत्म-रक्षा सेनाओं के सदस्यों ने 2011 में पूर्व जापान में आए भारी भूकंप के समय, अमेरिका और ऑस्ट्रेलिया की सशस्त्र सेनाओं के साथ अनुकरणीय सहयोग प्रदर्शित किया, और उन्हें हैती, इंडोनेशिया, और हाल ही में फ़िलीपीन्स में, जहाँ कहीं भी तैनात किया गया उन्होंने भारी प्रशंसा और सम्मान अर्जित किया है।
The modern states of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon thus arose as separate, independent entities.
Iraq today is not the unitary Arab nation-state that it was, and it is doubtful whether that state can be restored.
The emergence, after a prolonged and bloody civil war, of an independent South Sudan in 2011, freed the local Christian and animist population from the Arab/Muslim yoke.
Whereas secularism in the West arose with the emergence of liberal and democratic forces inspired by the Enlightenment, in the Muslim Middle East it has always been imposed by authoritarian rulers: the Shah in Iran, Atatürk in Turkey, Saddam in Iraq, Assad in Syria, and Nasser and Mubarak in Egypt.
Western statesmen are right to congratulate themselves on averting an immediate major crisis.
Instead, it considers every issue separately, unsure about how to balance its role as a global power with its commitment to liberal values, and led by a president who apparently believes that soaring rhetoric is a substitute for strategic thinking.
Of course, it is not easy to support a military coup against a democratically elected president (even one who, like Morsi, undermines the democratic values and institutions that brought him to power).
A rudderless US foreign policy is no response to a resurgent and neo-authoritarian Russia flexing its geopolitical muscle.
Jerusalem’s Arab population – which already accounts for more than 40% of the total – is growing by 3.5% annually, compared to 1.5% among Israelis.
Unsurprisingly, the 200,000 members of Israel’s liberal and prosperous middle class that abandoned the city in the last 20 years find Tel Aviv – Israel’s economic capital, and a center of technology-driven growth – far more appealing.
A Jerusalem controlled by non-productive Orthodox Jewish communities and disenfranchised Palestinians is destined for economic and political collapse.
For its part, the US has shifted substantial military power toward Asia – with high-profile military deployments in Australia and the Philippines, and 60% of America’s naval capabilities now deployed in the region – and has enhanced its defense ties with Japan and South Korea.
It is relatively content with Japan being a US security protectorate, because it fears the alternative: a Japan that expands its independent military reach.
China understands that, for now, US strategic primacy is an immutable reality.
Before China and the US overstep each other’s boundaries, they should abandon the concepts of “primacy” and “containment” in favor of a concert of Asian powers capable of resolving their differences.
But the failure to achieve this goal is precisely where the superior power is defeated in asymmetrical conflicts.
Contrary to what Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu believes, the main existential threat facing the country is not a nuclear-armed Iran.
It would also entail lifting the blockade and opening Gaza to the world.
TEL AVIV – Israel’s latest war in Gaza has echoed through Europe’s capitals in a powerful and destructive way.
But it does not even approach other humanitarian crises of recent decades, including those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
The hypocrisy of some of Israel’s critics in no way vindicates its colonial encroachment on Palestinian space, which makes it the last developed, “Western” country occupying and manhandling a non-Western people.
Jewish persecution, and the way that Zionism has employed it, has become a model for Palestinian nationalism.
The Middle East has long confronted the US with formidable challenges, which ultimately exceeded America’s imperial capacities and sapped public support.
Moreover, America’s Asian pivot is occurring at a time when its international credibility has been badly eroded by domestic political dysfunction and disappointing performance in the Middle East.
China’s exports to the Middle East are already more than twice those of the US.
It was born, after all, in the wake of the first Gulf War, and was facilitated by the regional consequences of the Cold War’s end.
The anarchy along Israel’s borders is becoming a breeding ground for Sunni extremists for whom the Jewish state is the ultimate enemy.
Recognizing the “Jewish state” would be a betrayal of the constituent ethos of Palestinian nationalism, while intrusive security arrangements would be a standing invitation to radical groups to fight what would be seen as occupation in disguise.
But Netanyahu’s school of thought is radically different.
While the US remains an indispensable global actor, it is no longer willing to use coercive diplomacy in its quest to build a new order.
Diplomatic ripening sometimes requires the mediator to be a manipulator and an arm-twister.
Within this new peace paradigm, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would become amenable to a truly international solution.
The initiators of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative understood this; perhaps now the US will come to appreciate it as well.
The same is true of antidepressants. 
Where is the concern about the millions who are becoming physically dependent on antidepressants? Where are the protests about the one-year-olds being treated with antipsychotic drugs?
Nominal interest rates – quoted in terms of dollars, euros, renminbi, etc. – are difficult to interpret, since the real cost of borrowing at these rates depends on the future course of inflation, which is always unknown.
Notably, the issuer, that is the borrower, can rationally plan such borrowing to make real investments.
The low level of real interest rates does not appear to be due to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
This would be an opportune time for governments to issue more inflation-indexed debt, to begin issuing it, or to issue nominal GDP-linked debt, which is analogous to it.
Bondholders were saved because governments generally chose to infuse cash in exchange for common or preferred shares – which are subordinate to bondholders’ claims – or to improve balance sheets by buying or guaranteeing the value of assets.
Indeed, the need to compensate bondholders for risks could provide market discipline: when financial firms operate in ways that can be expected to produce increased risks down the road, they should expect to “pay” with, say, higher interest rates or tighter conditions.
In other words, governments should establish bailout policies before the need to intervene arises, rather than make ad hoc decisions when financial firms get into trouble.
The pediatric trial data released by the MHRA presented a unique opportunity to examine whether the unpublished data supported the findings from published studies of SSRI’s.
The problem is widespread and not restricted to drug companies.
Should China be “Contained”?
With the end of the Cold War, the containment of the Soviet Union ushered in by Kissinger’s visit could no longer serve as the basis for US-China relations.
Clinton also began to improve relations with India, a strategy that has enjoyed bipartisan support in the US.
Such fears appear exaggerated, particularly when one considers that Asia is not one entity.
The US and China (as well as other countries) have much to gain from collaborating on transnational issues.
Crunch time is fast approaching.
The new German political party would attract much more support, and sentiment might shift.
The entrenchment of debtor-creditor relationships between the states of the eurozone would fuel political tension – as occurred in the United States in its first decades.
Franco-German reconciliation, the greatest success of the postwar period in Europe, would be in jeopardy.
Even more important are the argument’s economic flaws, three of which are immediately apparent.
The result is often a wage-price spiral that quickly offsets the competitiveness gains of a weaker currency.
Finally, proponents of a German exit claim that the eurozone in its current form is deeply flawed (although they usually are reluctant to provide details regarding exactly how).
This system could persist only through sustained public borrowing.
Is it too late to prevent a showdown?
Moreover, there are genuine fears that rogue elements in a divided Iranian government might leak weapons technology to terrorist groups.
Moreover, Iran’s support of terrorist organizations, such as Hezbollah, could bring violence to other countries.
Today, the diplomatic package consists mostly of penalties, albeit the small ones of targeted sanctions.
Mittal, the biggest steelmaker in the world, has successfully gained control of Arcelor, the second biggest, through what initially was a hostile takeover bid.
It tightens costs, and outsources work as much as possible, so its workforce is paid less than Arcelor’s employees and is less stable. Moreover, Arcelor represented a perfect takeover target: most of its capital belongs to diverse shareholders.
But the shareholders of Arcelor have made their choice.
Indeed, in reality, the company is a community of men and women who draw their incomes from the same economic and technical venture.
Various critics are seizing on such statements as evidence that the Fed is incompetent, and that its independence should be curtailed, or worse.
But that does not impugn the whole FOMC, much less the entire institution.
The idea was to save the financial system from having to deal with safely dismantling the impossibly complex contractual edifices – which did not allow for the possibility of systemic collapse – that it had constructed.
Were concerns mounting at the Fed as well in the summer of 2008? We will have to wait until next year to find out.
“It is the violence that keeps us here,” he said. “It is the peace that allows us to go.”
Kurdish politicians within the new parliament have good reason to protect these lucrative deals as debate begins over constitutional changes.
But attacks in Iraq’s “Sunni triangle” (and Baghdad in particular) occur at a rate rivaling those in Chechnya and the Niger Delta.
As a result, any attempt at decisive military intervention would be not only difficult, but also extremely risky.
But the US and the West cannot leave the matter entirely to others or confine their efforts to the United Nations, where Russia and China prevent any effective action.
To meet these criteria would require convening interested countries in order to gain greater insight into both internal Syrian and regional implications of military action.
But the sheer complexity of conditions in Syria means that the regime’s endgame could trigger a transition unlike any other in the Arab Spring, different in both its domestic course and in its effects on the region.
In an interview in the London Sunday Times , he was quoted as saying that he was gloomy about Africa’s prospects, because “All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really.”
What does raise the suspicion of racism, however, is propagating a negative view of the facts when that view lacks a solid scientific foundation.
The dangers are obvious enough.
In explaining why it was canceling Watson’s lecture, the Science Museum said that his remarks had gone “beyond the point of acceptable debate.”
Recently, some unusual research has raised new questions about the role of intuitive responses in ethical reasoning.
The only way you can prevent the trolley from killing five people is by pushing this large stranger off the footbridge, in front of the trolley.
Greene found that people asked to make a moral judgment about “personal” violations, like pushing the stranger off the footbridge, showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with the emotions.
On the contrary, these findings should make us more skeptical about relying on our intuitions.
The Kyoto Protocol was a major achievement, yet it left out 75% of the sources of emissions: the US, the largest polluter, refused to sign.
The timing of the conference is not propitious.
Giving emission allowances is like giving away money – potentially hundreds of billions of dollars.
Moreover, Europe has grown used to the concept of cap-and-trade, and many are loathe to try an alternative. Yet, no one has proposed an acceptable set of principles for assigning emission rights.
Hope Amid the Middle East’s Turmoil
Against all the odds, Yemen is undergoing a process of political transformation, with 500 delegates from all parts of society working on plans for democracy, justice, and equality.
Meanwhile, with a genuinely inclusive and objectively administered constitution, Egypt could pivot back toward democracy.
Evolution, if attainable, is clearly preferable.
A functioning private sector that creates adequate jobs, and schools that educate the large young population for today’s inter-connected world, are prerequisites of progress.
The entire world has a massive interest in where these threads lead.
Of course, without universal and coordinated international political, economic, and media support for these brave monks, all development in Burma may quickly be put back nearly 20 years.
But giving up is not an option.
Mexican homeowners who install energy-saving systems such as solar water heaters are becoming eligible for lower-rate “green mortgages.”
Many countries and companies are forging ahead, signaling a determination not to be held hostage by the slowest at the official negotiating table.
Of course, not every country approaches innovation in the same way.
Beyond its own specific objectives, the initiative can help to catalyze a broader transformation of the Dutch tech culture.
LONDON – If Socrates’s gadfly was in Silicon Valley, it would have a lot of lazy horses to sting.
As the world looks to Silicon Valley and sees an echo chamber of self-righteous conceit, mature and law-abiding technology companies are assumed to be inside it, too.
Much of Silicon Valley’s success stems from its tight networks – people who have been successful and support one another.
Ironically, questioning prevailing wisdom – and thereby inventing radically new solutions – has been Silicon Valley’s modus operandi from the outset.
CAMBRIDGE – During the last decades of the twentieth century, Silicon Valley was the unparalleled epicenter of high-tech innovation.
For the first time, “unicorns” (startups that reach a valuation of more than $1 billion) are no longer the exclusive preserve of the United States – a reality that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
Speaking at Stanford University’s 2013 commencement, he quipped, “I believe that more and more Stanford graduates will find themselves moving to Silicon Alley, not only because we’re the hottest new tech scene in the country, but also because there’s more to do on a Friday night than go to the Pizza Hut in Sunnyvale.
Before long, the digital world and the physical world will be indistinguishable.
But, just like Cricket Australia, the message is clear: There will be no change to business as usual.
A $13 billion “fine” for a company the size of JPM is about as painful as Clarke’s fine is for him – not painful at all.
Marianne Lake, JP Morgan’s chief financial officer, has suggested that about $7 billion of the fine is likely to be tax deductible, that is, treated as a form of necessary and usual business expense.
WASHINGTON, DC – The banking system has become most central bankers’ Achilles’ heel.
José De Gregorio, the governor of the Central Bank of Chile from 2007 to 2011, is an important exception.
This benefited Chile – a major copper producer – and much of Latin America.
In a boom, this may seem irrelevant; but, as De Gregorio knows, pressure on emerging markets – and richer countries – arises all too often, and frequently at unexpected moments.
In many countries, people on the right of the political spectrum provide a bastion of support for the central bank.
The main problem is that the Fed has not moved with alacrity to implement fully key provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which were passed in 2010.
With that much leverage, it does not take a lot to create fear of insolvency.
With the Tea Party wing of America’s Republican Party scaring investors out of the dollar, interest in the Chinese renminbi’s potential as an international reserve currency can only increase.
Banking has become an instrument of economic policy to ensure GDP growth and employment creation, while keeping inflation at an acceptable level.
Can the BoE – and the UK Treasury – really provide downside insurance for this full amount, or are the UK authorities set on the path to becoming another Iceland (where the value of bank assets peaked at more than 11 times the country’s GDP)?
(The precise numbers are different in other industrialized countries, but the rise of finance is a general phenomenon.)
The question is no longer so much one of beliefs.
With the exception of the United Kingdom, the extreme free-market view gained less traction in Europe in recent decades than it did in the US; nonetheless, the challenge of implementing financial reforms in the eurozone is actually more difficult.
The first, heard mostly from executives at leading global banks and their allies, is that the system is safer than it has ever been.
Bank regulators are starting to take these issues more seriously – an encouraging change from the 1990s and early 2000s, when the Fed was among the cheerleaders for unfettered financial innovation, without adequate consideration for systemic risk.
This needs to be done as a technical matter, not as part of the political process.
Two Views of Finance
“Banks will need to hold more capital” is a common refrain, describing efforts by regulators – and, in the United States, some legislators – to require that financial institutions fund themselves with relatively more equity and less debt.
(Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig have pointed out that there are many misperceptions in this area; but, of these, misconstruing capital is surely the most fundamental.)
We need these firms to be able to fail without causing a global panic.
The costs are likely to be far higher than they were in 1814.
Those details – for example, in Admati’s recent testimony to the Senate subcommittee chaired by Brown – are not in doubt.
The GAO report also refers to the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010, including the requirement that large bank holding companies create “living wills.”
How to Become an Oligarch
But a new book, Private Equity at Work, by Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, explains exactly how a few people have become immensely rich through the shrewd strategic use of debt.
Most of it is raised from outside investors.
However, before graduates flock to private equity, they should know that only the very big funds can use debt to skew returns for insiders in this way, primarily because only they can raise the capital needed to buy well-established companies that are rich in fixed assets, and thus in potential collateral.
That sounds bad.
But that is why it is good to be big – you can get more downside protection from the Federal Reserve or other official sources.
The most prominent example is money-market mutual funds. These entities take money from investors and buy various kinds of assets, some of which may be risky – like short-maturity corporate debt.
The third set of shadow activities includes those that may yet emerge.
The Ukrainian crisis may prove helpful, though that appears less likely now – which may be a good thing to the extent that one unintended consequence could be a loan to Ukraine that is larger than it really needs.
In the highly charged partisan atmosphere of Washington, DC, this is without question almost always an advantage.
These countries’ global economic and financial significance has grown rapidly, yet they have relatively little representation at the Fund.
What Ukraine needs is a sharp reduction in corruption, as well as real legitimacy (through the ballot box) for people who want to rein in the influence of oligarchs – a group that has sapped the economy through plunder and incompetence over the past two decades.
It appears to ease depression’s most severe symptoms within minutes or hours, even in patients who have a dismal track record with other treatments.
But, though ketamine’s promise has stirred excitement among clinicians and neuroscientists, it has also sparked controversy, owing to the drug’s potentially harmful side effects.
In fact, ketamine’s future as a therapy for depression would be uncertain even if its efficacy were more strongly established.
The so-called “neocolonialist school,” popular among China skeptics, considers China’s economic relationship with Africa as essentially imperial.
This is a serious accusation, given that one of the big attractions of foreign direct investment is local job creation.
Finally, there is the argument that Chinese FDI fails to transfer technologies and skills to local businesses – what economists refer to as “positive spillovers.”
This could encourage investment in a range of higher-value-added sectors, promote positive spillovers, and minimize adverse effects.
Jihadis have exploited the security void created by last year’s revolution to reinforce their presence in Sinai.
When the guns fell silent following the two countries’ 1973 war, Egypt stopped viewing Israel as a threat.
The government’s counter-terrorism policies also work against an enhanced military role in quashing the Sinai jihadis.
Turkey’s Iran Strategy
First, they interpret the deal as vindication of their ill-fated effort in May 2010 (together with Brazil) to reach an agreement with Iran on the disposition of Iran’s nuclear fuel.
As a result, Turkey’s export potential has been negatively affected by the rising stringency of the sanctions regime against Iran, with trade losses estimated at $6 billion for the first nine months of 2013.
ISTANBUL – Turkey’s beleaguered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) have emerged victorious from this week’s local elections.
With the AKP’s overwhelming triumph in the local elections, Erdoğan can now justifiably claim that the Turkish electorate backs his approach, including his government’s suspension of the rule of law in order to obstruct corruption investigations that it views as a judicial coup attempted by Gülen’s followers.
Long gone are the days when the prospect of accession to the European Union sustained a powerful dynamic of democratic reform.
If Erdoğan believes that a higher level of antagonism is necessary to retain power, he may remain oblivious to the harm done to Turkey’s international standing.
For a thousand years, states have regulated maritime transportation for the purpose of promoting safety at sea.
This valuation may not constitute the full amount of damages that the heirs of those who have died as a result of a crime or a breach of contract may eventually recover.
As a consequence, they settle for the crumbs that are eventually offered by the ship owners after a disaster.
Indeed, the list of disappointments pre-dates Israeli statehood and the Nakbeh itself: the King-Crane Commission of 1919, the 1937 Peel Report, the British White Paper of 1939, the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry of 1945, and the UN Partition Plan of 1947.
Writing in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , Shirl McArthur, a retired US Foreign Service officer, estimates that direct US aid to Israel between 1949 and 2006 totaled $108 billion.
Sleepwalking in the Balkans
This toxic interaction is at the heart of today's Bosnian crisis.
Like Dodik, Russia is exploiting weak EU resolve, making trouble for the US and EU where possible.
Slouching Toward Gaza
But Hamas’s brinkmanship is a dangerous exercise, for a low-intensity conflict can easily degenerate into an all-out flare-up if its rockets cause a politically unbearable number of casualties on the Israeli side.
Indeed, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, might be ready to pay a high political price during an electoral season by accepting even a new lull that is intermittently violated by Hamas.
Slouching Toward Sanity
Nationalizing Fannie and Freddie, and using them to peg the price of mortgages, would have been the cleanest and easiest way to accomplish that.
Opponents of recent economic policy rebel against the hypothesis that an absence of government intervention and support could produce an economic decline of that magnitude today.
It is a pattern that has caused real damage, because overoptimistic forecasts delay measures that are needed to boost growth, and thus impede full economic recovery.
In economies with excess capacity (including human capital) and a high degree of structural flexibility, the multipliers are greater than once thought.
It is equally unclear what will happen to asset prices when monetary assistance is withdrawn.
Labor markets have been knocked out of equilibrium as new technology and shifting global supply chains have caused demand in the labor market to change faster than supply can adjust.
Slumdog Oscar
Exuberant, exciting, gaudy, and gritty in a way that can only be called Dickensian, Slumdog Millionaire brings contemporary Mumbai to life from the seamy side up, and it does so with brio, compassion, and all-round cinematic excellence.
This may reveal something of Boyle’s view of human nature, but most Indian viewers know they live in a land largely devoid of larger-than-life heroes.
Small Economies, Big Problems, and Global Interdependence
If CDSs are concentrated in particular financial institutions, these institutions could be at risk – more so than the primary purchasers of Greek debt themselves.
One can find other examples of this kind.
As these examples indicate, however, systemic importance is not just a question of size.
As a result, global corn, wheat, and soybean prices rose in July and August, and remain high.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development sees enormous potential in Africa’s agricultural sector, which experienced 4.8% growth in 2009, compared to 3.8% in the Asia-Pacific region and only 1.4% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We should consider not only how to improve the ability of smallholder farmers to grow food; we also must strengthen their ability to participate in markets, while improving the way those markets function.
In September, the world’s 193 governments will meet at the United Nations in New York to agree on a set of global targets that will direct these resources.
Many others generate only slightly more than a dollar per dollar spent.
More than two billion people carry the TB bacterium, and at some point about 10% of them will develop the disease, which kills some 1.5 million victims per year (compared to 20,000 dead in the recent Ebola outbreak).
Focusing on coral reefs turns out to be a surprisingly efficient target.
This would mean $1,000 more for each person in the developing world every year, and would lift a staggering 160 million people out of poverty.
As the debate shifts from austerity towards measures aimed at stimulating growth, smarter taxation will be essential to getting the balance right.
Conventional taxes raise revenue, but pose a much greater risk of depressing growth in the process.
Given Europe’s fiscal deficits and the economic impact of reducing them, that is a huge potential prize.
Fortunately, recent research points to a smarter way to tackle climate change.
Cambridge University Press is publishing their research and findings this month, under the title Smart Solutions to Climate Change.
The reason is simple.
To ensure that we have enough time to conduct the necessary R&amp;D, we should step up our commitment to research into climate-engineering technology.
Had the American people chosen John F. Kerry over George W. Bush last November, the reunion would be seen by both sides as a new beginning, resonant with personal warmth.
If the negotiations should fail, the transatlantic cleavage could once again become glaringly wide.
The drafters of the farewell communiqué are, no doubt, already at work listing all the issues on which the two governments see eye to eye.
What could revive that habit? Perhaps only a miracle: real progress in the Israel-Palestine conflict, which both the US and the Europeans could then claim to have helped bring about.
The US accuses China of using cyber espionage to steal intellectual property on an unprecedented scale.
Some of America’s allies, now professing outrage at disclosures of US spying, have been known to do the same thing to the US.
In terms of civil liberties, examining the content of a message from a suspect non-American source is less controversial.
Rather than demonstrating hypocrisy and acceptance of the erosion of civil liberties, the Snowden disclosures have provoked a debate that suggests the US is living up to its democratic principles in its traditionally untidy ways.
Particularly in developed economies, social policies must adjust to provide the support that lower-income groups need, while encouraging growth and advancing wellbeing.
The startup Handy hopes that its app achieves similar success in connecting customers to independent contractors providing various household services.
The main difference between the progressive vision of a society underpinned by these “citizen accounts” and the conservative idea that individual citizens should create personal retirement accounts, take out student loans, or cover their own health insurance is the public sector’s role.
To be sure, this approach will not magically resolve all of the challenges countries currently face.
In Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, social democracy is proving that it can work.
Indeed, despite the government’s successes, there could be a change, as the Partido Nacional of the center-right bloc is now running neck-and-neck with the FA.
The Urban Village
A growing body of evidence suggests that similar functions govern even more aspects of urban life than the research by West’s team indicated.
A recent paper (of which one of us, Carlo Ratti, is a co-author) uses anonymized data from telecommunications networks across Europe to explore how human networks change with city size.
What computational social science offers is the prospect of quantifying such observations and gaining insights that could shape the design of urban environments in the future.
Unfortunately, not enough attention is being paid to the link between these two key issues.
As it stands, Social Security and Medicare are unsustainable, with the long-term gap between projected income and promised benefits reaching tens of trillions of dollars – well in excess of the official debt the federal government has accumulated over its history.
Seniors working past the retirement age of 67 should not be subject to the payroll tax, and the retirement earnings test should be eliminated, so that seniors can work full-time without losing out on Social Security benefits.
With so few presidential candidates recognizing the link between reforming Social Security and Medicare and ensuring broadly shared prosperity, the US faces serious risks.
In 2000, the world’s governments adopted the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which aim to halve global poverty by 2015.
To tackle global problems, we need to strengthen and democratize international institutions like the United Nations.
Mass migration from poor countries has created fear and xenophobia in richer countries, especially among the working class.
Empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well.
Russians, for example, rejected Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a clownish Donald Trump-like nationalist and anti-Semite, in favor of Boris Yeltsin, who had stared down tanks during the failed 1991 coup and recognized that his country’s future lay with democracy and the West.
One cause for this shift toward authoritarianism is that many countries no longer view the United States as a beacon of democracy and a model of stability and prosperity to be emulated.
Citizens seem convinced.
Putin’s efforts to reclaim “great power” status for Russia may find support among his people; but that support will probably dwindle if Russians face the prospect of losing all of the comforts derived from the relatively open economy that their country has had for more than two decades.
At the supranational level, the new European Commission is pursuing its goal of “better regulation” using as little formal lawmaking as possible, focusing instead on recommendations, codes of conduct, and guidelines.
It is simply more difficult for 193 states to reach agreement than it was for the original 51 signatories of the post-World War II conventions that established the contemporary international order.
This year will offer one more critical opportunity to reestablish hard legality in international negotiations: the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December.
World leaders need a success story to get them motivated.
Maybe that’s really how it is.
This year it is monks in Tibet.
I hope that this issue does not derail the Chinese effort to use the Olympics as an opportunity to show the world that their country has emerged again as one of the world’s leaders.
This is super-charged American soft power.
Faced with the embarrassment of his pastor’s views on race and on America, Obama did not go into a huddle with spin-doctors to fathom how he should deal with the problem.
That is what my children would call a “no brainer.”
He is correct, up to a point.
The US is more powerful than any country since the Roman Empire, but like Rome, America is neither invincible nor invulnerable.
The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations - Islam versus the West - but a civil war within Islamic civilization between extremists who use violence to enforce their vision and a moderate majority who want things like jobs, education, health care, and dignity as they pursue their faith.
In 2003, a bipartisan advisory group reported that the US was spending only $150 million on public diplomacy in Muslim countries, an amount it called grossly inadequate.
Tidak diragukan lagi perkembangan ini bagus untuk perjuangan melawan perubahan iklim.
Selain itu, karena pembangkit listrik tenaga surya umumnya dapat dioperasikan secara terpisah dari jaringan listrik interregional yang kompleks, maka mereka menciptakan cara bagi negara yang kurang berkembang untuk menghasilkan listrik tanpa membangun infrastruktur baru yang mahal.
Studi yang dilakukan Fraunhofer Institute menunjukkan bahwa selisih dalam pengeluaran modal (capex) sama pentingnya bagi biaya per kilowat-jam dengan selisih pada cahaya matahari.
All of these were great and noble qualities, and all of them now seem utterly superfluous to most Poles.
Political apathy reflects many factors, but two stand out.
Unsurprisingly, the young are the most estranged.
But that a third of all children in a member country of the European Union live on one meal a day is a source of shame – and thus should also be a primary political issue.
For the problems of anomie, apathy, and political charade are not Polish problems, but maladies that increasingly afflict democracies everywhere, and that urgently call for a restoring of faith in parties and politics.
One is to hark back to older modes of solidarity.
Indeed, the utter lack of a sense of solidarity among so many people – horrifyingly evident in the US health-care debate – is now undermining the very basis of what a modern democratic society is.
This can succeed only if we engage in vigorous exchange with each other in order to create a kind of mutual respect for these different views.
But the scale of the disaster facing Japan is so monumental that it demands our help.
It is time for all of us, not just in our professional capacities, but also as individuals, to turn our thoughts and actions to those affected.

इसी तरह, नगरों द्वारा यूनिट के आकार की अपेक्षाओं जैसे भूमि के उपयोग संबंधी प्रतिबंधों में ढील दी जा सकती है, ताकि उच्च-घनत्व वाली, और इस प्रकार अधिक मूल्यवान, परियोजनाओं के लिए अनुमति दी जा सके। अचल संपत्ति के डेवलपरों को अधिक मूल्य प्रदान करने की एवज में, नगर निगम के अधिकारियों द्वारा यह शर्त लगाई जा सकती है कि भूमि के एक अंश या एक निश्चित संख्या में इकाइयों को किफायती आवास के लिए निर्धारित किया जाए। इस तरह की क्रॉस-सब्सिडी से विभिन्न आय वर्गों के लिए आवास की आपूर्ति में वृद्धि होगी और इससे जनता पर कोई सीधी लागत भी नहीं आएगी।
साथ ही, नगर निगम डेवलपरों के लिए वित्तपोषण की लागतों को कम करने के लिए किफायती इकाइयों की खरीद को प्रतिबद्ध करके या योग्य किरायेदारों की गारंटी देकर परियोजनाओं को "जोखिम-रहित" बना सकते हैं। नगर निर्माण कार्यों को तेज़ी से पूरा करने के लिए अनुमोदन प्रक्रियाओं को भी सरल बना सकते हैं।
Kapal-kapal asing yang menggunakan pukat dasar (bottom trawl) melakukan penangkapan ikan yang tidak bertanggung jawab dan bertindak berdasarkan impunitas, menyeret jaring-jaring berukuran besar, menghancurkan dasar laut dan merusak habitat laut yang vital seluas 120.000 kilometer persegi (46.000 mil persegi).
Bahkan, hampir setengah dari perikanan yang kita kelola saat ini tengah dieksploitasi pada tingkatan yang berkelanjutan. Tetapi kita memerlukan investasi lebih besar untuk perbaikan infrastruktur untuk mewujudkan potensi industri secara maksimal.
According to the most recent United Nations figures, 400,000 people, or roughly one-third of Mogadishu’s population, have fled the city.
The same lack of security applies to delivering aid: on a recent visit to North Somalia to assess humanitarian needs, a team from the International Rescue Committee of which I was a part spent more time, effort, and funds on security issues than on inspecting wells and evaluating the need for latrines, although the lack of water and sanitation is acute.
If only such practices were used to tackle the vast majority of the problems that overwhelm Somalia.
But if the government is to succeed and prevent further violence, Kenya must tackle the roots of its election chaos.
The organization—which claims one million members—is guilty of horrific acts of violence that continue unabated, including the recent beheading of the son of one of Kibaki’s key allies.
The state then brutally crushes the militias, making matters worse, and politicians manipulate the actors for their own purposes.
Of course, Sarkozy would be surprised to be told that the same logic should lead to a declaration of repentance by the French state to Algeria, not to mention to the Algerian soldiers who fought under the French banner, the so-called “Harkis,” many of whom were abandoned to a terrible fate when France left the country in a hurry.
To ask for forgiveness enables one to speak to the “Other” without ambiguity, with the freedom of speech needed to express truth. Indeed, former French President Jacques Chirac won a place in French history by proclaiming France’s responsibility for the crimes committed by the collaborationist Vichy government against its Jewish citizens during the Nazi occupation.
Repentance is not a sign of weakness. On the contrary, it is a demonstration of tranquil and conscientious strength – and a precondition of good and realistic governance.
And it rewards me if I delete them all by crossing that sender off the list (yes, I’m so easy to manipulate!).
The first rule is to have a clear, unique subject line – “follow-up re BioWorks, deadline Nov.
Busy people travel a lot and often check their email in trains, planes, and the WiFi-free countryside, where online access is limited.)
By contrast, most social-network email is not just unstructured, but almost actively obscure.
South Africa needs to reclaim the economic initiative, by – literally – building the Africa of the future.
South Africa is home to several well-established, innovative banks that are well placed to offer low-cost, digital services to millions of currently unbanked African households and businesses.
The key to reigniting South Africa’s economic growth is an ambitious regional strategy driven by government and business leaders working in partnership.
Together with President Nelson Mandela’s moral authority, this status helped the party to accommodate a wide range of interests and establish a stable economic order without losing the support of poor black voters, many of whom fell outside that order. Although supporters’ expectations were high, so was their patience – a dynamic reinforced by the ANC’s liberation mythology and early successes in expanding housing, electricity, and social grants.
Last year’s wave of wildcat strikes in the mining sector – which precipitated the infamous “Marikana massacre” – ended up shaving 0.5% off the country’s GDP growth in 2012.
Ramaphosa’s respectability will undoubtedly provide the party (and the scandal-plagued Zuma) with some badly needed cover.
The problem partly reflects a lack of consensus about the criteria that a judicial candidate must satisfy.
Over the last few weeks, we, as well as others, have sought to encourage the nomination of progressive judges to fill the Constitutional Court vacancy.
Women’s groups lose the right to complain about the lack of women on the bench if they fail to nominate women for vacant positions.
Anonymity was not their goal. They wanted to be identified as defenders of a cause.
In Afghanistan, Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies sought “strategic depth” against India. Moreover, they wanted payback for India’s role in supporting the revolt in the 1960’s and 1970’s that led to Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan.
In fact, it was even involved in rescue operations on the Pakistani side of Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake there.
Militants of all stripes must be decommissioned completely and transparently.
China knows that, under international law, its claim to sovereignty over virtually all of the resource-endowed South China Sea, based on an “historic right,” is weak; that is why it has opposed international adjudication. Instead, it is trying to secure “effective control” – which, under international law, enhances significantly the legitimacy of a country’s territorial claim – just as it has done in the Himalayas and elsewhere.
Some already have.
So, is a US-China conflict in the South China Sea imminent?
But China did not avoid conflicts with its maritime neighbors.
If China claimed such a zone for each of the sites it occupies, it could close off most of the South China Sea. As one US official put it, China seems to be trying to “create facts on the ground” – what Admiral Harry Harris, the US commander in the Pacific, calls a new “great wall of sand.”
China’s Self-Destructive Maritime Strategy
And, although the US is not explicitly supporting the Philippines in the legal case it has brought to the United Nations asserting that China’s claims are illegal under the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the complaint clearly has the tacit backing of most of the Philippines’ allies.
This disparity represents an important opportunity for countries like the US and Japan, which are trying to discipline a delinquent China in the South China Sea by demonstrating their overwhelming naval power – and thus their capacity to deny China access to key sea-lanes.
But lately its economy has been faltering, with GDP growth averaging 3.6% for the last ten years – a significant drop from the 8.1% annual growth rate that prevailed in 1965-2005.
South Korea’s relationship with China perfectly illustrates the challenges it faces.
This will require reversing the sharp decline in the proportion of middle-income households, which is down to 67.5%, from 75.4% in 1990.
Stricter rules are needed to improve corporate governance and prevent unfair practices by those affiliated with the chaebols.
The challenge for South Korea stems from the inevitable tradeoff between legitimacy and workability.
Of course the pressure to expand is always irresistible.
I would favor articulation of the principle that the necessary concrete steps toward long-term fiscal consolidation in advanced countries – such as raising the retirement age or taking other steps today to reform public pensions – need not require premature withdrawal of current fiscal stimulus;
Fiscal stimulus turned out to be more widespread in 2009 than one might have guessed.
But the election may well have a more positive impact on the region as a whole.
Park avoided active politics for many years after her parents’ death, but later won a parliamentary seat.
And, although South Korea has slipped to 80th place in the IPU’s most recent rankings, the fall reflects subsequent growth in the proportion of female legislators in other countries.
Korea is not the first emerging market to chair the G-20, but it is the first to do so since the global financial crisis.
Given the nature and gravity of the crisis, it was brutally obvious what the priorities for the G-20 should be.
Progress here has been inadequate, despite much talk.
After all, no one anointed these 20 countries as the designated representatives of the world.
As chair, it needs to act as an “honest broker.”
If geography is destiny, South Korea was dealt a weak hand.
Sometimes, Koreans compare their country of 50 million to a neighbor like China or a superpower like the US and believe that they cannot compete with such giants.
Over the next half-century, South Korea became the world’s 11th largest economy, with per capita income reaching more than $15,000.
Korean popular culture has also crossed borders, particularly among younger people in neighboring Asian countries, while the impressive success of the Korean diaspora in the US has further enhanced the attractiveness of the culture and country from which they came.
China and South Korea need no introduction to each other, of course – such is the burden of history in the region.
Indeed, she was elected with a curious blend of support: right-wing backers of her father, Park Chung-hee, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1961 to 1979, and many other Koreans, including some on the left, who wanted someone different from the usual blue-suited, white-shirted Korean politician.
The Chinese will look at her carefully, and may well be sizing her up as an immediate neighbor should North Korea persist on its current course to total isolation and oblivion.
SINGAPORE – Can ten countries with different cultures, traditions, languages, political systems, and levels of economic development act in concert to expand their collective potential? That is the question with which the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been wrestling for decades.
By making exporting more efficient and less costly – up to 20% cheaper, in some sectors – a wide range of goods and services would become attainable for millions of new consumers. This could boost consumption across Southeast Asia, leading to a virtuous circle of growth.
ASEAN’s lower-income economies have expressed concern that they will miss out on many of the benefits of deeper integration.
MANILA &#45;&#45; Pakistan’s near political chaos, the result of President Pervez Musharraf’s declaration of martial law last year and the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, has had a tsunami-like impact across Southeast Asia.
Bin Laden’s most recent threats have been equally universal.
Recall a letter from the convicted terrorist Ramzi Yousef, which was found in his Islamabad safe house after he was arrested in February 1995.  
At the height of the Soviet-Afghanistan war in the 1980’s, Pakistan was the covert conduit for Filipino Muslim militants passing to and from Afghanistan and back to the island of Mindanao, which has long been a stronghold of Muslim rebels.
In addition to becoming more active in world diplomacy, Yudhoyono will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this month to discuss buying Russia’s newest fighter jets.
The possibility that Southeast Asia’s governments might begin to play America and China off against each other is one of the concerns that most animates the latest US quadrennial defense review, which is intended to “focus on the Pacific Ocean” in awareness of China’s growing naval power.
South Korea, too, has joined the scramble.
For those Asian countries that recall Japan’s moderate and sensible advancement of regional policies since the 1960’s, there is a growing expectation that Japan should re-think its stance.
Strong capital inflows, especially of foreign direct investment, and terms-of-trade recovery since 2009 have made the region less vulnerable to external shocks –&#160;that is, to recurrence of the abrupt capital-flow reversal that occurred in late 2008 and early 2009.
This policy stimulus led to strong growth, in both consumption and investment, and economic activity recovered quickly.
These measures, plus a reduction in tax revenues, should reduce the primary surplus and contribute to reviving demand.
In Argentina, the authorities’ battles with a small number of “investors” (so-called vulture funds) jeopardized an entire debt restructuring agreed to – voluntarily – by an overwhelming majority of the country’s creditors.
Has the country been put on a sustainable debt path? Too often, because the defenders of the status quo do not ask these questions, one debt crisis is followed by another.
That is why we find the claim by some – including the US Treasury – that there is no need for an international rule of law so incredible.
A “soft law” framework containing these features, implemented through an oversight commission that acted as a mediator and supervisor of the restructuring process, could resolve some of today’s inefficiencies and inequities.
That legal vacuum matters, because, as we now see in Greece and Puerto Rico, it can suck the life out of economies.
But some powerful actors would stop well short of establishing an international legal framework.
Yet all refuse to accept that the rationale for a domestic rule of law – including provisions to protect weak borrowers from powerful and abusive creditors – applies at the international level as well.
Debt restructuring is not a zero-sum game.
The government is investing in “micro” satellites, building on its existing SumbandilaSat platform.
McGruder, who works closely with African astronomers, agrees that a space program for the region is critical to raising the profile of careers in science and engineering in a part of the world where the most educated people still go into finance or management.
To be sure, South Africa’s push to join the world’s technological leaders is not limited to space research.
But all signs indicate that the month will end in doubt and pessimism.
The foundations of Spain’s current labor laws date to 1938, when the civil war was tearing the country apart.
Meanwhile, it distorts reality to view Spain’s entire banking sector through the prism of the cajas, the savings banks that are the soft underbelly of the Spanish financial system.
Spain’s soccer victory was not a fluke but the culmination of a long evolution to emerge as a winning machine from its Francoist furia española past.
But the heavy industries in which many were employed have now closed, and unemployment is widespread.
Yet this is not enough to reverse a rising tide of violence and discrimination, compounded by the recent economic recession.
In conjunction with the launch of the Decade of Roma Inclusion in 2005, my foundation network formed an alliance with the World Bank and transferred its Roma educational programs to a newly established Roma Education Fund.
If Spain leads the way, all of Europe will ultimately reap the benefits.
A second argument is that higher oil prices are due to lower interest rates and anticipations of higher long-term prices.
Indeed, the spike in oil prices actually gives independent producers an incentive to boost production.
However, there is considerable evidence that strongly indicates rampant speculation in today’s oil markets.
As a result, speculatively driven high prices can persist for a considerable time before economic fundamentals bring them down, as finally seems to be happening.
Until Byrnes’ “Speech of Hope,” the Allies were committed to converting “…Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in character.”
But once President Harry Truman’s administration decided to rehabilitate Germany, there was no turning back.
It is the mark of ancient societies, like those of Germany and of Greece, that contemporary tribulations revive old fears and foment new discord.
She could use the opportunity to hint at a new approach to European integration, one that starts in the country that has suffered the most, a victim both of the eurozone’s faulty monetary design and of its society’s own failings.
Just a year ago, the United States had five major freestanding investment banks that stood atop its mighty financial sector.
Let’s ponder this.
Thus, unlike in the 1930’s, the US faces a hypertrophied financial system.
Europe’s Procrustean Nightmare
German-French relations, once the cornerstone of European integration, are at their lowest point in decades.
While Greece’s eurozone partners may be able to carry it for decades this way, and even to bail out Spain, the system would surely collapse under the weight of a larger economy.
But, like the struggling countries of southern Europe, France has few options.
Europe’s leaders must stop treating the eurozone as a homogeneous entity, imposing one-size-fits-all policies on vastly different countries.
In fact, he engineered an agreement to merge Citi with a large insurer – illegal at the time under Glass-Steagall – and then pushed for the law’s repeal, so that the merger could proceed.
Those who say that the financial recent crisis tells us to re-enact Glass-Steagall overlook what failed and what did not: the largest failures in the 2008 crisis – Lehman Brothers, AIG, and the Reserve Primary Fund – were not deposit-taking commercial banks on which Glass-Steagall’s repeal had a major impact.
Rather, the best case arises from a general sense that financial institutions have become too complicated to regulate and too big to fail even when staying within their traditional businesses.
Small-town bankers throughout the country wanted government-guaranteed deposit insurance, while stronger big-city banks feared that government deposit insurance would put them at a competitive disadvantage.
Satu hal yang jarang dibicarakan adalah dampak lingkungan hidup dari proyek ini yang bisa mengakibatkan bencana besar.
Lebih luasnya, semua negara yang bertanggung jawab atas degradasi dan kerusakan di ekosistem perairan dangkal di Laut Cina Selatan harus menghentikan segala tindakan yang mengancam keanekaragaman hayati dan produktivitas ekonomi di wilayah tersebut.
Dalam kondisi yang mengharuskan penerapan hukum internasional, negara-negara yang paling berkuasa yang selayaknya menjadi teladan.
However, this Sputnik moment – actually a “Dragon moment” – delivers a somewhat different message.
Of course, I must confess a personal interest in this question.
Its founder, Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa (who in his spare time also runs Tesla, the electric-car company), funded it with his own money (which he earned at PayPal, another start-up) and that of other private investors.
The US government (or European governments, for that matter) can’t get us out of our current economic mess any better than they can get us to the moon at this point.
Meanwhile, in the United States, the controversy over government spying on its citizens seems to have died down, mostly because people are now convinced that their government will only look at the really bad guys.
Causes are the hardest to understand.
Yes, it is true.
So a “casual” production style was adopted, similar to the design of worn and ripped jeans.
Squaring Asia’s Nuclear Triangle
It emphasized the importance of sharing information about nuclear safety, and incorporated specific measures, including the creation of a framework for rapid notification in the event of an emergency and exchanges of experts to assist in managing future nuclear crises and ensuring that regional concerns are taken into account.
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou was as surprised as the Japanese by the size of the contributions made by his people.
And, while they did bring nuclear safety to the fore and agreed to cooperate and share information with each other, efforts to meet this region-wide challenge cannot succeed without bringing Taiwan into the discussions.

परंतु पिछले महीने श्रीसेना ने अचानक राजपक्षे को उस श्रीलंका फ्रीडम पार्टी के टिकट पर संसदीय चुनाव लड़ने की अनुमति देने का निर्णय लिया जिसका नियंत्रण श्रीसेना ने राष्ट्रपति पद पर विजय प्राप्त कर लेने के बाद राजपक्षे से हासिल कर लिया था। लगता है कि श्रीसेना के विक्रमसिंघे के साथ संबंध बहुत अधिक बिगड़ जाने के कारण, जिनकी लोकतंत्र समर्थक यूनाइटेड नेशनल पार्टी आगामी चुनाव में SLFP की मुख्य प्रतिद्वंद्वी है और SLFP के भीतर गुटबाजी बढ़ जाने के कारण राष्ट्रपति के पास इसके सिवाय कोई विकल्प नहीं बचा है कि वे राजपक्षे को शामिल करें।


But it is not too late for President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government to change course and begin to build a truly multi-ethnic society.
These victories create an opportunity for the government to reach out to the opposition and to minority groups to build a truly inclusive and democratic Sri Lanka, but this has not yet happened.
The government must open itself far more to hearing and responding to the legitimate voices of the Sri Lankan people across the country’s political spectrum and ethnic divides.
But this stability fuels fears that Somaliland’s people will activate the declaration of independence they adopted in 1991.
Saudi Arabia supports the TFG financially and politically.
Secession is in itself neither good nor bad: like divorce, it may make people more or less content.
So there is no question of one clan or faction imposing independence on the others.
Moreover, Central Asian leaders are eager to maintain NATO’s presence in Eurasia as a way to balance China and Russia.
Elsewhere, political parties are weak or are tools of the regime.
Elsewhere in the post-Soviet world, Georgia’s success shows that determined governments can reduce even entrenched venality.
Stagflation Cometh
Now the day of reckoning looms.
What’s more, if the US convinces China to let its currency appreciate, the cost of living in the US and elsewhere will rise.
Europe, for instance, will find it increasingly difficult to export.
After seven years in which America has seen its national debt rise from $5.6 trillion to $9 trillion, this should be welcome news – but the timing couldn’t be worse.
Economic growth rates in the United States and Europe are low – and well below even recent expectations.
Hence the rising risk of a major downturn – and additional fiscal distress.
But the declining value of their sovereign debt – and the size of that debt relative to that of Europe’s smaller distressed countries – implies much greater erosion of banks’ capital base, raising the additional risk of liquidity problems and further economic damage.
But that is neither the majority view, nor the view reflected by the markets.
This somewhat bleak picture could change, though probably not in the short run.
In the autumn, the shootings and deportations resumed, complemented by economic coercion.
We now know, after 20 years of discussion of Soviet documents, that in 1932 Stalin knowingly transformed the collectivization famine in Ukraine into a deliberate campaign of politically motivated starvation.
But Viktor Yanukovych, the current Ukrainian president, denies the special suffering of the Ukrainian people – a nod to Russia’s official historical narrative, which seeks to blur the particular evils of collectivization into a tragedy so vague that it has no clear perpetrators or victims.
And in Belarus, Europe’s last dictatorship, collective farming was never undone, and a former collective farm director, Aleksandr Lukashenko, runs the country.
In large bookstores across Russia, a huge number of political biographies and histories portray Stalin and his era.
Next to Lenin’s tomb is Stalin’s grave and monument, where heaps of fresh flowers are always to be seen on the anniversaries of his birth, his death, and the victory over Hitler.
The reburial of the Romanovs, however, didn’t touch the public’s emotions for long.
Shock therapy that ruined the economy and gave away the country’s wealth to private but rarely clean hands? Neither democracy nor markets are seen by most Russians as absolute values, because they have failed to deliver either prosperity or security.
Instead, acknowledging Stalin is a way for Russians to recall a time of great deeds and perhaps even greater sacrifices.
One of the greatest challenges I faced as the ICTY prosecutor was convincing the Serbian public that the court was not a politically motivated conspiracy against Serbia.
Despite years of complex negotiations, deep disagreements persist over key issues related to amending the statute on aggression, such as state consent and how cases would be initiated.
Whereas Americans depend upon tax-deductible private donations and box office receipts to finance live classical music, Europeans prefer direct government support for the arts.
Daniel Barenboim is rumored to have left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him.
But cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth.
If orchestras don’t look after their own futures, they may well not have one to look after.
And inflation is – like default – a capital levy on holders of public debt, as it reduces the real value of nominal liabilities at fixed interest rates.
If growth does not recover, the fiscal problems will worsen while making it more politically difficult to enact the painful reforms needed to restore competitiveness.
If, instead, private debts are excessively socialized, the advanced economies will face a grim future: serious sustainability problems with their public, private, and foreign debt, together with crippled prospects for economic growth.
While North Korea had done much over the preceding years to warrant a more critical eye, in retrospect these policies set back prospects for peace and stability in the region.
At the same time, Obama’s advocacy of direct diplomacy caused concern during the campaign, with some questioning whether this meant that he would meet a leader such as Kim Jong-il without preconditions.
But America must stay the course.
As a result, even the most successful managers lack the skills to cope with today’s resource-constrained markets.
Today, drilling is not only a dirty process characterized by heavy equipment, toxic mud, and sulfurous fumes. With the integration of information technology and hydraulic-fracturing (“fracking”), the central players are experts using joysticks and high-resolution screens to maneuver drill bits through geological formations.
Forward-thinking entrepreneurs are already reaping the benefits of this fast-moving revolution. Those who fail to adapt will fail to survive – and soon.
The debate over therapeutic cloning is, of course, hardly limited to the US and Italy.
Some Christian theologians, for example, believe that life begins at conception, while scientists maintain that nerve and brain cells emerge around 14 days after conception.
And, in order to enable the full enjoyment of our freedoms – be they of worship or scientific research – the state must reassert its secular nature.
Over the same period, there has been a dramatic adjustment of China’s international balance-of-payments position.
This argument is politically expedient – but wrong.
As China rebalances toward a growth model that draws greater support from domestic demand, Washington should stop ranting about the renminbi and start focusing on the opportunities that this bonanza will create.
The Fed Trap
(Not coincidentally, this view coincided with a similar conclusion professed by Bernanke in a scathing attack on the BOJ in the late 1990s.)
In fact, since early 2008, annualized growth in real consumer expenditure has averaged a mere 1.3% – the most anemic period of consumption growth on record.
Fearful of market disruptions, the Fed has embraced a slow-motion exit from QE.
The US Treasury was complaining yet again about the Chinese currency, which had depreciated by 2.4% against the dollar in the first half of 2014, after having appreciated by 37% over the previous eight and a half years.
In the end, moral hair-splitting is less important than the blame game itself – a visible manifestation of the deepening bilateral distrust wrought by a destructive phase of Sino-American codependency.
At around 47% of GDP, China’s embryonic services sector remains well short of the 60-65% share that a middle-income economy typically possesses.
In other words, the cyber blame game is pointless.
On the contrary, financial and economic insecurity has gripped Chinese households since the “iron rice bowl” – the cradle-to-grave support that the socialist state offered workers and their families – was discarded in the late 1990’s.
Several other measures proposed at the Third Plenum seek to shift Chinese families’ behavioral norms.
Today, the task at hand is very different: to transform the technocratic framework of the producer model into the aspirational vision of a flourishing consumer society.
But with China’s leaders now focusing squarely on aligning the vast population’s behavioral norms with the next phase of transformation, the case for a consumer-led China has become more compelling than ever.
I prefaced my question by underscoring the inherent contradiction between a target and a forecast in framing China’s major economic objectives.
Unlike most Western observers, who are fixated on the slightest deviation from the official growth target, Chinese officials are actually far more open-minded.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of the People’s Bank of China, was just as emphatic on this point.
Their shared interpretation of flexible growth targeting puts them basically in the same camp as policymakers in most of the developed world.
But my advice is to keep the champagne on ice.
Accounting for 69% of the economy, consumer demand holds the key to America’s post-crisis malaise.
This should not be surprising.
Until balance sheets are repaired, such “zombie congestion” restrains aggregate demand.
Plunging debt service is largely an outgrowth of the Fed’s unprecedented zero-interest-rate policy.
With bilateral frictions mounting on a number of fronts – including cyber security, territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas, and currency policy – the summit offers an opportunity for a serious reconsideration of the relationship between the world’s two most powerful countries.
Huge Chinese current-account surpluses resulted from too much saving and too little consumption.
China counters by underscoring America’s saving shortfall – a gap that must be plugged by surplus saving from abroad, a current-account deficit, and a multilateral trade imbalance with more than 100 countries.
The upcoming Strategic and Economic Dialogue provides the US and China a platform of engagement to seize their collective opportunities.
NEW HAVEN – Relapse is the rule in the post-crisis global economy.
Consider the US.
This poor performance can only exacerbate the European Central Bank’s deflationary concerns.
When hit by them, vigorously growing economies have cushions to withstand the blows and the resilience to shrug them off.
In Japan, long-standing structural problems, such as aging, labor-market rigidities, and a generalized productivity malaise, can be addressed only through the so-called “third arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s reform agenda, which remains woefully incomplete.
It began so innocently.
China buys Treasuries because they suit its currency policy and the export-led growth that it has relied on over the past 33 years.
China’s purchases of Treasuries help hold down US interest rates – possibly by as much as one percentage point – which provides broad support to other asset markets, such as equities and real estate, whose valuation depends to some extent on Chinese-subsidized US interest rates.
US-led China bashing – a bipartisan blame game that reached new heights in the 2012 political cycle – remains a real threat.
For China, this is not a power race.
This takes an enormous toll.
While my country, Rwanda, has reduced child mortality by 70% over the past decade, the rate of stunting remains high, with 44% of children under the age of five chronically malnourished.
The British medical journal The Lancet has described a package of effective interventions to accomplish this.
Simply flooding markets with cheap high-calorie, low-nutrient grains will never solve chronic malnutrition.


शांति में निवेश के लिए स्पष्ट मानवीय कारणों के अलावा, ख़ास तौर से जब इसे अंतर्राष्ट्रीय विकास के स्थापित ढाँचे के भीतर किया जाता है, ऐसा निवेश अर्थव्यवस्था के विकास और बजट संतुलन के लिए भी सबसे किफ़ायती तरीकों में से एक होता है। यह सचमुच एक चर्चा योग्य विषय है।
Pain can be classified according to a variety of factors, such as duration or location.
The problem is that subjective measures are much more difficult to study – not least because they are associated with high placebo response rates.
Financial incentives have compounded the problem, leading to some alarming trends.
The long-term pain treatment with the strongest empirical support involves lifestyle modifications such as exercise, stress reduction, and weight loss – all of which require significant time and effort.
Synthetic biology is high-tech, and it is also potentially high-risk. Even as it attracts billions of dollars in investment, it is the subject of growing international concern.
Moreover, poor farmers have been actively encouraged to invest in stevia, because its cultivation can help preserve fragile and unique ecosystems. In its annual survey of leading global risks, the World Economic Forum noted that, “the invention of cheap, synthetic alternatives to high-value agricultural exports … could suddenly destabilize vulnerable economies by removing a source of income on which farmers rely.”
Stick to the Resolution
And from the other side, many commentators – anxiously or cynically, according to taste – have drawn parallels with Iraq and other past misuses of Western military power.
And, as for the wider mandate to protect civilians, the resolution allows airborne attacks to knock out tanks or troop columns advancing on Benghazi or other rebel-held towns, and – should they exist – concentrations of forces within those areas that pose a direct and immediate threat to Qaddafi’s opponents.
As the situation in Libya and the wider Middle East unfolds, policymakers are bound to face further acute dilemmas, not least in responding to continuing repression in Tripoli, or the similarly ugly and fragile situations in Bahrain and Yemen.
It should not be. All of this was predictable.
Banks will not lend if the economy is in the doldrums, and American households will be particularly reluctant to borrow – at least in the profligate ways they borrowed prior to the crisis.
But the more immediate problem remains deflation, given high unemployment and excess capacity.
Even putting aside the human suffering, this means, in turn, more problems for the financial system.
But Obama is also concerned with reversing a sharp rise in income inequality (which is now at an 80-year high).
The total tax burden on families also includes sales taxes, which are steeply regressive, and property taxes, which are progressive.
Public consumption is just as progressive as transfer payments.
Indeed, from 2000 to 2004, the increase in net government expenditures accounted for 150% of income growth, as other sources of income shriveled up.
The S&amp;P’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the trailing 12 months is close to 20, compared to a long-run mean of 15.53 and a median of 14.57.
(Of course, markets take detours along the way, driven by, say, irrational exuberance, temporary declines in the impact of value investors, or mistimed contrarian trades.)
There is some evidence that this is now occurring in advanced economies, with the proliferation of labor-saving digital technologies and the globalization of supply chains suppressing income growth.
Nonetheless, several features of current growth patterns stand out: excess productive capacity, persistent high leverage, declining labor content in goods-and-services production, and an increasingly unequal distribution of income both between labor and capital, and across labor-income segments, with their differential savings rates.
This 6.9% annual average return has since been referred to as “Siegel’s constant,” as if Siegel had discovered a new law of nature.
On closer inspection, the idea that the market will yield a real 6.9% a year in the future appears suspect.
Of course, if one looks at many different investment strategies and many different countries, one can find something that performed spectacularly in the past, even if there is no strategy that can be expected to do so well in the future.
The US was actually ranked first among the 39 countries.
That is, the markets have been more vulnerable to sudden large drops than they have been to sudden large increases.

Before that, between the third quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2002, real S&amp;P 500 earnings fell 55% – the biggest-ever decline since the index was created in 1957.
Big drops get their attention, and this primes some people to be attentive for them in the future, and to be ready to sell if another one comes.
BERKELEY – After the second 40% decline in America’s Standard &amp; Poor’s composite index of common stocks in a decade, global investors are shell-shocked.

But aren’t stocks risky?
True, a steep and persistent collapse in earnings will erode wealth invested in stocks.
Stop Coddling Belarus
So it is now more important than ever that European parliamentarians unite and make their position clear.
But at the same time the OSCE is condemning these anti-democratic practices, its own Parliamentary Assembly maintains full-fledged cooperation with the Belarusian parliament.
Even that small number is likely to diminish, as Lukashenka keeps up political, financial, and legal pressure on them.
Stop Digging And Start Thinking
This fact will be noted everywhere, particularly in Teheran.
The US will have to enter talks – direct and bilateral if necessary.
Iraq is a disaster, and nothing indicates that the situation can be turned around.
Militant Palestinians and Lebanese know that a captured Israeli soldier or civilian is either a cause of conflict or a valuable bargaining chip for prisoner exchange.
As before there were expressions of “deep regret,” a promise of “immediate investigation” and the explanation that dropped leaflets had warned families in the region to leave their homes.
Except for mutually agreeable negotiated modifications, Israel’s official pre-1967 borders must be honored.
Similarly, Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez has broadcast his intention to purchase Russian Mig fighter jets and Brazilian low-flying surveillance aircraft, and to expand military expenditures.
In Venezuela, keeping his former comrades in arms happy is obviously a concern for Chávez. But festering conflicts with his Colombian neighbors are also a factor, particularly in view of the constant accusations and suspicions that Chávez comforts and supports the FARC guerrillas in Colombia.
Obviously, I am rooting for the Mexican candidate, Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez.
So rising prices feed back into more rising prices, and the cycle repeats again and again – for a while.
The whole world can’t recover all of the enthusiasm of a few years ago from feedback alone, for there is a giant coordination problem: we are not all attentive to price increases at the same time, so we make decisions to buy at very different times.
But it is hard today to re-create such a narrative, given so many stories of trouble.
This means making capitalism work better, and making it clear that there is no threat of protectionism.
For example, the Philippines is revamping its security strategy by enhancing cooperation with the United States – China’s counterweight in the region – only two decades after it closed two major American military installations, the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base.
Some claim that the local PLA commander initiated the “stand-off,” while others contend that China’s new president, Xi Jinping, was using the transgression to assert his authority over the PLA.
Moreover, India is working to safeguard its naval superiority over China.
This antiquated international spoils system is a leftover of the post-World War II order, in which the victorious powers divided the leading positions in the world economic institutions among themselves.
What should the IMF do if a country wants to leave the eurozone, or if a European country defaults on its debts, as Argentina did?
In the interest of the IMF’s credibility – and of the stability of the world economy – Strauss-Kahn should put the matter to rest once and for all, by declaring unequivocally his intentions regarding the French presidency.
The ASEAN+3 is now strengthening the CMIM by doubling the total fund size to $240 billion.
Last year, ASEAN+3 established a regional surveillance unit, the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), to monitor regional economies, detect emerging vulnerabilities, and support effective decision-making by the CMIM. But it is unclear whether AMRO has sufficient capacity and expertise to monitor 13 countries effectively.
In particular, the IMF and ASEAN+3 financing arrangement should establish a regular channel of dialogue to facilitate information exchange and prepare concrete guidelines for cooperation and an appropriate division of tasks.
The International Monetary Fund provides one of the most important tools.
Second, there is now clear advice to the Fund’s member countries on how they should run their exchange rate policies, and on what is acceptable to the international community.
Few countries need to borrow from the IMF – a highly positive trend.
How to Boost Foreign Investment
This began to change with the rapid proliferation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs), which typically granted private investors standing before the ICSID.
Moreover, the devaluation of the reputational benefit of being a party to the ICSID encourages countries to leave the system, as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela have recently done.
Beyond the obvious availability of countervailing duties as an enforcement tool, several of the DSM’s institutional characteristics, which are absent in the ICSID, help to create and sustain legitimacy.
The risk of nuclear or other radioactive material falling into the wrong hands is all too real.
The uranium was seized in a sting operation.
The proposed amendment was agreed in 2005, but it still has not entered into force, because not enough countries have ratified it.
Peer reviews have been shown to work – for example, in improving safety at nuclear power plants.
हरारे - व्यवसाय शुरू करना मुश्किल काम हो सकता है, ख़ास तौर से अफ़्रीका में, जहाँ कमज़ोर शासन प्रणालियाँ और महत्वपूर्ण संसाधनों तक अपर्याप्त पहुँच सफलता में बाधा बन सकती है। अफ़्रीका के किसानों के लिए, चुनौतियाँ विशेष रूप से स्पष्ट हैं। गतिशील और आधुनिक कृषि क्षेत्र के व्यापक आर्थिक और सामाजिक लाभों को देखते हुए, किसानों को ऐसे प्रोत्साहन, निवेश, और विनियम उपलब्ध करना सर्वोच्च प्राथमिकता होनी चाहिए जिनकी उन्हें सफल होने के लिए ज़रूरत है।


The unemployment rate is 5.6% and falling.
As a result, these countries can expect lower capital inflows, again making for weak local currencies.
As it stands, the low official unemployment rate can be explained partly by declining participation rates, especially among workers aged 25-54.
Currency forecasting is a mug’s game.
The question now is how quickly are species being destroyed – and what can be done to stop it.
· Most species have very small geographical ranges and are uncommon locally.
The CBD’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity calls for the formal protection of at least 17% of the most ecologically important terrestrial areas, while the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation seeks to protect 60% of plant species.
LONDON – The G-8 recently asked the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was created to support the post-communist transitions to democracy and market economies in Central and Eastern Europe, to put its experience to use in Egypt.
The richness of Eastern European transition experience offers valuable clues about how to break out of being “stuck in transit.”
In fact, the ability of voters to remove incumbent governments has proven to be a strength, not a weakness.
As for most of the countries of the former Soviet Union, which remain stuck in transit, EU membership is not in the cards for North Africa and the Middle East.
General Electric and IBM have both opened schools where students can benefit from a focus on math, engineering, and science.
Externships offer students a better way to acquire skills, because students are given an opportunity to help a company solve a real-world problem from the classroom.
Finally, they work on identifying problems themselves, forming teams, and competing in international venues.
By helping companies solve their real-world problems, students can prepare themselves to meet the challenges of the future.
Who but the most die-hard global-warming denier could resist the notion, as Earth Hour’s American website phrased it this year, that merely “by flipping off your lights on March 27 at 8:30 p.m. local time you will be making the switch to a cleaner, more secure nation”?
As WWF Director-General James Leape explained, it provides “a global platform for millions of people to voice their concern about the devastating effects of climate change.”
Surely, there is a lesson here.
But the centuries-old culture of leadership that is ingrained in many African societies has played an equally disastrous role.
When sub-Saharan African countries gained independence in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, their leaders inherited bankrupt states with no access to international capital markets. As a result, newly established African leaders had no alternative but to sub-contract economic development to the IMF and World Bank and the Western countries that control them.
According to the US Energy Department, America’s annual oil imports from Africa will soon reach 770 millions barrels, bringing an estimated $200 billion to the continent over the next decade.
Europe, Asia, and, increasingly, Latin America, are showing that regional integration provides the healthiest path to development.

Adanya pasar karbon yang meliputi 85% emisi gas rumah kaca menjadi inti strategi pemerintah Québec untuk melawan perubahan iklim.
Negara bagian ini berkontribusi pada lebih dari 40% kapasitas operasional listrik yang bersumber pada tenaga angin di Australia dan menjadi salah satu negara dengan tingkat penetrasi tenaga surya yang tertinggi di dunia (satu dari empat rumah tangga memiliki sistem fotovoltaik).
Advocates of greater labor-market flexibility insist that paying employers to hire young people is the wrong approach.
So those who are included and benefit by free enterprise, yet are burdened by the social costs of exclusion, should all be willing to pay something to remedy these conditions.
What is needed is higher employment and pay through higher demand for the least productive workers.
Since the least skilled workers face morale problems that lower their wages and erode their employability, it makes sense to deliver the mutual gain that is redistributed to them through subsidies that encourage greater self-support and employment.
But the past few years have underscored NATO’s inability to achieve sustained political, economic, and security improvements in Afghanistan without more effective international collaboration, particularly with China and Russia.

In May 2008, China obtained a major economic stake in Afghanistan when Chinese firms won a $3.5 billion contract to develop Afghanistan’s huge Aynak copper field.
In turn, NATO and Afghan forces could assign troops to protect these projects from further attacks, ideally with some kind of Chinese and Russian financial assistance to blunt objections that Western soldiers are dying to enrich foreign companies. China’s close ties to Pakistan could also prove useful in assisting European and American efforts to keep the Pakistani military and intelligence services allied against the Taliban.
It wants more local control.
For starters, the central or federal government should retain significant fiscal powers.
And that, revealingly, is precisely what the eurozone has.
These issues are now likely to be reopened with further devolution.
JOHANNESBURG – It has been said, correctly, that Sudan is a microcosm of Africa.
Conflict has also communicated the unequivocal message that unity cannot be secured and maintained by force alone.
A turbulent and unstable Sudan would not therefore be a catalyst of peace and stability in Africa, and vice versa.”
It is in Africa’s interest to see Sudan’s people living together in peace and cooperating with one another for their mutual benefit – fully respecting one another’s diverse but not mutually exclusive interests, whether they live in one country or two.
The terrible tragedy of the country’s western Darfur region continues unabated.
But it was our meetings with the ordinary people of Sudan that left the deepest impression.
After all, Sudan is not a small, insignificant country; it is the tenth largest – the biggest in Africa and in the Arab world.
Moreover, full and unfettered access by international election observers to monitor next year’s elections and the referendum in 2011 is essential.
The door to a better future for Sudan remains open.
From a truly secular and global perspective, the difficulty lies in explaining the pre-crisis boom.
Central to understanding this puzzle are two distinctive features of the emerging-market productivity shock: it was resource-intensive and mercantilist in origin and consequence.
That may have been true in the immediate aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but it was quickly overtaken by the growth imperative.
Today, as world growth decelerates, secular stagnation seems plausible once again.
The Sunni militant group Boko Haram, known internationally for abducting 276 schoolgirls in April and forcing them to marry its members, has been wreaking havoc in Nigeria for years.
The sectarianism plaguing the Sunni belt is affecting even the relatively stable oil sheikdoms of the Gulf, where a schism within the Gulf Cooperation Council is spurring new tensions and proxy competition among its members.
The UAE and Qatar have already instituted compulsory military service for adult males.
On the contrary, in the Sunni arc today, it means a vicious cycle of expanding extremism, rapid population growth, rising unemployment, worsening water shortages, and popular discontent.
World leaders should be happy that the IMF stands ready to take the lead in the next phase of the global financial crisis, even if its lending resources of approximately $250 billion are inadequate to stem the current run on emerging markets.
In principle, the IMF could be allowed to print money (it already has its own accounting unit, the so-called Special Drawing Rights).
As tempting as it may be to ramp up IMF lending on a long-term basis, this would be a strategic mistake for both the world and the Fund.
Meanwhile, Germany’s insistence on imposing losses on bank creditors in Cyprus is the latest symptom of bailout fatigue in the core.
Overall, these four countries (the BRICs) have been over-hyped, and other emerging economies may do better in the next decade: Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia in Asia; Chile, Colombia, and Peru in Latin America; and Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Poland in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
Its current-account deficit remains large, and monetary policy has been confusing, as the objective of boosting competitiveness and growth clashes with the need to control inflation and avoid excessive credit expansion.
Mothers’ Day is upon us in many countries around the world.
“Life lost its meaning,” she told American lawmakers in 2008.
They may struggle to find proper nutrition and work long hours in factories and fields until the day they go into labor.
Add some basic antibiotics, blood transfusions, and a safe operating room, and the risk of death can almost be eliminated.
Despite recent financial market turbulence, the underlying dynamic of the world economy remains essentially unchanged.
The evidence suggests that other factors such as the quality of economic and political institutions are at least as important in determining how much capital a country will attract.
But even if capital controls could still fully insulate a country from the forces of financial globalization, such a goal would not be desirable.
But is everyone really ready to receive such large amounts of capital and to carefully manage its macroeconomic impact?
Yet the global economy is not delivering sustainable growth in two basic senses.
To seize the benefits of these new technologies at scale, and to avoid investments that aggravate cascading environmental crises, the finance industry will need to understand how the SDGs will reshape the investment landscape.
This implies the continued globalization of finance, which will be essential to allocate money from capital-rich regions to their poor, capital-scarce counterparts, as well as to develop local capital markets that can facilitate capital formation and protect countries from the vagaries of global sentiment.
With United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s call to action in his report “The Road to Dignity,” the Year of Sustainable Development has begun.
The SDGs are premised on the need for rapid far-reaching change.
The July summit will seek to elicit from the world’s governments a commitment to allocate more funds to social needs.
Back in 2009 and 2010, the world’s governments agreed to keep the rise in global temperature to below 2° Celsius relative to the pre-industrial era.
PRAGUE – Over the next 15 years, some two billion children will be born, 90% in the poorest parts of the world.
Although the child mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds since 1970, a horrifying number of children still die in their first years of life. In 2013, 6.3 million children died before their fifth birthday.
Kids who do not get enough to eat during their vital early years do not develop properly and remain disadvantaged throughout their lives. Even those who get enough overall calories can suffer ill effects, if they are deprived of essential vitamins, minerals, and protein.

दूसरा उद्देश्य है सार्वजनिक प्रबंधन के लिए डेटा। अधिकारी अब सरकारी सुविधाओं, परिवहन नेटवर्कों, आपात राहत कार्यों, सार्वजनिक स्वास्थ्य निगरानी, हिंसक अपराधों, और अन्य कई चीज़ों के बारे में उन्हें वर्तमान स्थिति के बारे में सूचित किए जाने के लिए रीयल-टाइम डैशबोर्ड रख सकते हैं। नागरिक प्रतिक्रिया से भी कामकाज में सुधार किए जा सकते हैं, जैसे चालकों से यातायात की जानकारी को क्राउडसोर्स करके। भौगोलिक सूचना प्रणालियों (जीआईएस) से स्थानीय सरकारों और दूर-दराज के क्षेत्रों में स्थित जिलों में रीयल-टाइम निगरानी की जा सकती है।

GENEVA – After decades of reluctance on the part of world leaders, a rapid, smooth, and purposeful transition toward sustainable development seems unlikely.
Indeed, agreements like last year’s deal between China and the United States to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions – not to mention initiatives to mobilize business, such as We Mean Business – are unlikely to happen without them.
As the UN Environment Programme emphasized in a briefing at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saving the financial sector from itself can accelerate the transition to sustainable development.
What the world needs now are leaders who are willing to bridge the gap between daunting short-term demands and desirable long-term outcomes.
Trend ini dipicu oleh lonjakan tenaga surya di Tiongkok dan Jepang dan peningkatan investasi negara-negara Eropa untuk pembangkit tenaga angin di laut.
Rancangan sistem keuangan kita yang sekarang tidak menjamin kondisi yang disebut Gubernur Bank of England, Mark Carney, sebagai “tragedy of horizons” – kegagalan pada pasar yang diakibatkan oleh ketidakmampuan investor, perusahaan, dan pemerintah dalam menyelesaikan permasalahan seperti perubahan iklim, sehingga menciptakan konsekuensi yang baru akan dirasakan jauh di masa depan – tidak akan terjadi.
Pemberlakuan tujuan baru ini menunjukkan penerimaan secara luas atas fakta bahwa semua negara berbagi tanggung jawab yang sama untuk menjaga stabilitas jangka panjang siklus alami bumi, dimana kemampuan planet untuk mendukung kehidupan kita bergantung padanya.
Populasi global akan distabilkan.
Pada tahun 2030 nanti, besar kemungkinan beberapa negara dapat melepaskan diri dari bahan bakar fosil, dimana negara seperti Swedia, Prancis, dan Jerman akan memimpin.
MADRID – Next month, the world will achieve a milestone for global development efforts.
Likewise, primary-school enrollment rates have risen from 83% to 91% since 2000.
In this sense, the SDGs more clearly reflect the conviction, upheld by the UN, that all of us are global citizens.
But it is up to the international community to ensure that all governments establish specific goals and deadlines for meeting them.
Information technology – this century’s defining social and economic development – receives only a brief mention (in one of the sub-targets).
As smartphone subscriptions increase from 2.9 billion to 7.7 billion worldwide in the next five years, 80% of the new accounts are expected to be opened by users on these two continents.
If the SDGs are any indication, it is likely that they are not.
MDGs akan meneruskan upaya pengentasan kemiskinan, serta menambahkan tantangan guna memastikan pemerataan pembangunan dan keberlanjutan lingkungan hidup, khususnya sasaran utama untuk meminimalisasi bahaya perubahan iklim yang disebabkan manusia.
Dalam salah satu pidato terbaik di sejarah kepresidenan modern Amerika Serikat, disampaikan pada bulan Juni 1963, Kennedy berkata: “Saat kita bisa mendefinisikan tujuan dengan lebih jelas, menjadikannya lebih mudah diatur dan diterapkan, kita akan membuatnya terlihat nyata bagi semua orang sehingga mereka mampu merajut harapan dan melangkah menuju pencapaian tanpa halangan apapun.”
Proses multi-stakeholder ini sangat penting untuk mengatasi tantanga-tantangan kompleks dalam pembangunan berkelanjutan dan upaya melawan kemiskinan, kelaparan, dan penyakit.
Meskipun terdapat sinisme, kebingungan, dan politik menghalangi-halangi yang muncul di tengah upaya memberantas kemiskinan, ketidaksetaraan, dan degradasi lingkungan hidup, masih dimungkinkan timbulnya terobosan baru, Negara-negara berkekuatan besar di dunia mungkin terlihat tidak responsif, namun mereka dapat berubah.
The MDGs were remarkably successful in several of these areas.
Forty years after rich countries promised to dedicate 0.7% of GDP to aid, their commitments remain at less than half that level.
While levels of private finance dwarf international public finance, directing these private funds to programs that reach the poorest and protect the environment requires the right policy incentives, such as a price on carbon, regulatory certainty, and the wise use of public money.
We must improve and expand these types of partnerships to other challenges, such as infrastructure, agriculture, and energy.
Subsidi ini melemahkan anggaran pemerintah, menganjurkan penggunaan energi yang berlebihan, dan meningkatkan polusi dan emisi karbon dioksida.
Melalui kebijakan yang tepat dan dukungan internasional, negara-negara ini dapat berinvestasi pada infrastruktur yang dibutuhkan untuk mewujudkan pilihan energi yang lebih beragam.
Investasi ini meliputi penyimpanan energi, perbaikan sistem perkiraan dan smart grids – yang seluruhnya memperoleh manfaat dari terobosan-terobosan teknologi dan penurunan harga.
Berkat penurunan harga minyak, inovasi dan skala ekonomis dalam sektor energi terbarukan, kini visi tersebut dapat menjadi kenyataan.
Leaders must confront outmoded ways of working; endless hours of protocol (the sign of a poor government is a happy protocol office); and a dearth of sound advice on problems that developing countries frequently face, from financing infrastructure to attracting global investment.
Clearly, we need a wider concept of the finance and policies required to support development.
This should encourage us to find the right way for governments and philanthropists to cooperate in bringing about transformative, not merely palliative, change.
These changes are shaping our future in a positive way.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle will be the huge legacy of public debt, which now averages about 110% of GDP in the advanced economies – the highest level since World War&#160;II.
As a result, the system as a whole is not yet much safer than it was in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed.
While growth is essential for the future global economy, it must be a different kind of growth – inclusive and not simply the fallout of unfettered globalization.
The year 2013 offers the chance to put the economic crisis behind us and to shape the world for the better.
The Secretary-General’s Global Sustainability Panel has issued a new report that outlines a framework for sustainable development.
By 2050, there will most likely be more than nine billion people.
And we do so using an internal combustion engine that utilizes only a small part of the energy released by burning the gasoline. Most of the energy is lost as waste heat.
We must understand our shared fate, and embrace sustainable development as a common commitment to decency for all human beings, today and in the future.
In many places, especially in rural areas, women spend long hours each day finding fuel wherever they can in the absence of sustainable energy sources.
Worldwide, 800 women die each day from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and the vast majority of these deaths could be averted by providing quality health services, for which electricity is usually required.
Evidence from India and Nepal suggests that women’s involvement in decision-making is associated with better local environmental management.
If I were raped in Uppsala, where Assange is alleged to have committed his crime, I could not expect top prosecutors to lobby governments to arrest my assailant.
She is right: According to a report by Amnesty International, as of 2008, the number of reported rapes in Sweden had quadrupled in 20 years, but only 20% of cases were ever prosecuted.
Likewise, Swedish intake centers for victims of male violence are woefully underfunded – like all support services for rape and abuse victims across Europe and North America – leaving many women who face threats to their safety and that of their children waiting for unavailable places in shelters.
The day before, a bomb threat had been left at the building, warning of what was about to happen.
In January 2009, church officials in the town of Luleå cancelled a planned torch-light procession for Holocaust Memorial Day, with a spokesman saying that they were “preoccupied” and “grief-stricken” by Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in Gaza.
While all manifestations of intolerance against Muslims must be firmly resisted, it is also vital to recognize the danger that some Muslim immigrants have brought with them from their home cultures: extreme forms of bigotry against Jews and Israel.
Sweden in Crisis
In fact, the three leftist parties in Parliament gained a slightly smaller share of the popular vote than they did in the 2010 election.
Until 2010, Sweden seemed immune to the rise of far-right parties like those in Denmark, Norway, and Finland.
During the Bosnian War of the 1990s, Sweden opened its doors to some 100,000 people – a challenge at any time, much less during a period of profound economic crisis.
But other European countries will have to bear more of the burden, and the authorities will have to do more to facilitate integration.
MEXICO CITY – As the saying goes: when the tide goes out, you find out who has been swimming without a bathing suit.
The global financial crisis thus revealed the Mexican economy’s inability to innovate, promote investment, create jobs, or provide conditions for social mobility.
Regrettably, the promotion of economic growth has not been a priority for either the Calderón administration or that of his predecessor, Vicente Fox.
What is certain is that health officials risk mishandling how they explain this new and potentially alarming threat to the public.
But even a mild influenza virus kills a lot of people, especially those with other medical problems.
In the grip of “panic panic,” officials issue over-reassuring statements, suppress or delay alarming news, and speak contemptuously about how the public is “irrational,” “hysterical,” or “panicking.”
Health officials should guide people through their adjustment reactions, not demand that they skip that step.

Let us hope that officials elsewhere will do better. 
Obviously, exiting a real currency union is far more complex and legally fraught than ending a temporary exchange-rate arrangement; the effects of such a move would be greatly magnified.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Swiss move reveals at least some of the uncertainties that a full-fledged exit could create.
In the late 1960s, the Bundesbank had to buy dollar assets in order to stop the Deutsche mark from rising, and to preserve the integrity of its fixed exchange rate.
The Deutsche mark appreciated, and life became very hard for German exporters.
The negative effects for the Swiss economy – through the decreased competiveness of its export industries (including tourism and medicine) – may already be showing that abandoning the euro peg was not a good idea.
There is, however, a lively debate about whether there was a fourth big mistake: Alan Greenspan’s decision in 2001-2004 to push and keep nominal interest rates on US Treasury securities very low in order to try to keep the economy near full employment.
Some days I think that, in the future, central bankers must also recognize that it is imprudent to lower interest rates in pursuit of full employment when doing so risks causing an asset price bubble.
There were plenty of other mistakes that generated the catastrophe that faces us today.
After the government’s military achievements in Quseir and Homs, there has been some tactical regrouping by the opposition.
Those who fear a jihadi takeover cite recent events in Sinai.
But no coherent action or policy followed this powerful statement.
Aleppo is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world – and one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the war.
Falling oil prices and economic sanctions have affected both countries.
If the negotiations so far had recognized this and been conducted with more tenacity, the conflict in Syria could have been resolved long ago, averting much death and destruction.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has asked the new commissioner for regional policy, Johannes Hahn, to make recommendations aimed at redefining the European Neighborhood Policy, the framework through which the EU relates to its immediate geopolitical environment.
Syria, and its largest city, is the perfect place to start seeking a better way.
Assad’s fall would deny the organization its vital logistic hinterland in Syria, making it vulnerable to challenges by insurgent Sunni militias.
As in Libya, the fighting would make the country ungovernable.
Assad’s final days are unlikely to be pretty.
This year will mark the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnian War.
The international community has been unable to achieve any unity of action, much less agreement on a way forward.
What made the approach to Milošević possible was not that the 1990s were a gentler era (the Serbs’ campaign of ethnic cleansing, featuring concentration camps and capped by their genocidal attack on the Muslim Bosniaks of Srebrenica in July 1995, refute that notion).
Syria may be heading for eventual Sunni rule, displacing the political dominance of Assad’s Alawite sect.
The roots of US strategy in Syria lie in a strange– and unsuccessful – union of two sources of American foreign policy.
The problem, as human-rights advocates should have learned long ago, is that the US security establishment’s regime-change model does not work.
Saudi Arabia wanted Assad gone to weaken a client state of Iran, the kingdom’s main rival for regional primacy.
While roughly 500 people per month were killed from March to August 2011, some 100,000 civilians – around 3,200 per month – died between September 2011 and April 2015, with the total number of dead, including combatants, reaching perhaps 310,000, or 10,000 per month.
In Syria, only multilateralism can succeed.
That same urgency must be applied to peacemaking in Syria; after all, the refugees are a product of the country’s long, brutal, multi-sided civil war. The seriousness of the situation in Syria cannot be overstated.
Only if external powers think beyond military operations and devise a political solution to the crisis can the fight against the Islamic State succeed.
A good place to start would be by urging the so-called E3/EU+3 group – that is, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the US, and the UK), Germany, and the EU – to convene.
It was in the Balkans that the process of carving out nation-states from the Ottoman mosaic began. And it was a process that kicked off two decades of devastating wars – the first at the beginning of the twentieth century, the second in the 1990s.
Syria’s Christian minority would also be a victim of such an effort.
Indeed, Russia and the United States are circling each other like boxers before the contest actually begins, supporting different factions and trying to ensure that their allies in the multi-sided conflict are advancing, or at least holding ground.
The other countries have yet to take action.
Japan also wants to speed up implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, so that it can take advantage of the business opportunities that will result when economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic are lifted.
Egyptian diplomats are thus excellent candidates to exert pressure for compromise.
So the conflict in Syria is taking place on at least three levels: local, regional, and global.
But, although all players have agreed to fight ISIS first and foremost, the big question remains whether they will in fact do so.
Such a tendency is already visible in Iraq.
In this context, an important factor will be how the West treats its Muslims – as welcome citizens with equal rights and obligations, or as permanent outsiders and fodder for jihadist recruiters.
The new Arab generation’s quest for dignity is rooted in a yearning for decent government and civil rights that was long denied under the pretext of conflict with the “Zionist crusaders.”
Al-Qaeda’s move to the Levant also threatens to spark a momentous confrontation between Sunni radicals – some of whom have recently taken control of part of the Syrian-Lebanese border – and the Shia Hezbollah in Lebanon.
And yet the West is also hesitant to act, owing to fears of a repeat of the Iraq debacle.
The other three are Syria’s behavior in Iraq, its relations with the US, and the need for domestic reform.
Hariri’s assassination makes that far more difficult, and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France.
There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well.
The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad’s preferences.
On one side, the United States, the European Union, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are backing the opposition – a welter of armed factions with diverse agendas and ideologies that range from Syrian nationalist to global jihadi.
In order to defeat them, the opposition needs more sophisticated weapons – and its backers are ready to oblige.
When the Arab Spring began to unfold, Assad adopted the same approach, hoping that it would rally his Alawite supporters and scare the rest of the public into submission.
BERLIN – Syrian opposition activists regularly express disappointment with the level of international support that they receive.
In fact, the international community is waiting for Syria’s disorganized opposition to transform itself into a coherent, effective force as much as the opposition is waiting for the international community.
These groups already share a common goal – to bring down Assad’s regime – and most of them (with a few ultra-militant exceptions) hope to build a peaceful, inclusive, and democratic state.
Such a transitional authority could call upon the international community for needed support more easily than an exiled rebel group could.
After a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the West would rather stay at home; neither the US nor the United Kingdom – nor most other NATO members – wants to become entangled in another Middle East conflict that cannot be won.
But all of this has been happening already, and it will continue to happen, especially without American military intervention. The civil war will escalate further, because it is part of a larger contest for supremacy between Iran and its Shia allies and Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the other Sunni countries.
A defeat in Congress – entirely foreseeable – would have been a foreign-policy disaster.
This is the decisive moral and political question for the West.
In the war against the Islamic State, diplomacy will be vital to galvanize an alliance of countries dedicated to the group’s complete eradication – which will, however, have to happen on the battlefield.
It is time for the Sunni Muslim world to act more resolutely toward the brutal movement that it has, intentionally or not, helped to spawn.
The first pillar of democracy may be majority rule, but it is a hollow – and unstable – achievement if the second pillar, minority rights, is not also put in place.
Rather than getting distracted by some sense of wounded pride, those who have engaged in a conflict that has killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of innocent people and displaced millions more should decide to do what it takes to end the mayhem.
The lack of opportunities on offer in Syria’s neighbors is exacerbating the underlying economic problem.
The rest of the region wanted to emulate them.
There is no substitute for lasting peace in Syria. But they would offer a chance to begin addressing a tragic and avoidable consequence of the civil war: the exclusion of millions of people from the opportunity to earn a legal living for themselves and their families.
Instead of forcing a “Grexit,” the EU could trap Greece inside the eurozone and starve it of money, then simply sit back and watch the Tsipras government’s domestic political support collapse.
Given this possibility, Varoufakis may have believed that he was making other EU finance ministers a generous offer by proposing to cut the primary surplus from 4% to 1% of GDP, rather than all the way to zero.
The European treaties state unequivocally that euro membership is irreversible unless a country decides to exit not just from the single currency but from the entire EU.
Some fear a return to the uncertainty of 2012, when many thought that a Greek default and exit from the eurozone were imminent.
For starters, Syriza and others argue that Greece's public debt, at a massive 170% of GDP, is unsustainable and must be cut.
To be sure, one can reasonably argue that austerity in the eurozone has been excessive, and that fiscal deficits should have been much larger to sustain demand.
Last year, the new Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, confirmed the prediction, arguing that a primary surplus would give Greece the upper hand in any negotiations on debt restructuring, because it could just suspend repayments to the troika, without incurring any financing problems.
How wrong we were.
Post-Soviet Russia’s struggle to integrate into the international order, together with its rejection of modernization, has fueled a revisionist nationalism based on spheres of influence.
Recognizing Asia’s profound importance to the new world order, US President Barack Obama announced a strategic “pivot” toward the region in 2012.
Member states’ tactical approach to their particular problems (often defined by their status as creditor or debtor) has left the EU bereft of credible leadership and a unified vision. A more strategic approach would focus on boosting growth throughout the EU, such as by meeting the Europe 2020 targets for research, development, and innovation, and advancing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Since then, China has sought to make good on Mao's pledge.
But, there is another dynamic at work.
For economic convergence, if allowed to ripen, could set Taiwan and the PRC on an evolutionary course toward common sovereignty.
For the first time in fifty years, China and Taiwan share real interests.
A recount was demanded.
But the questions on everyone's lips are whether the loser of the recount will accept the result, and whether Taiwan's young democracy can survive this tumult?
That dominance is now definitively a thing of the past.
For example, the two parties are now engaged in tense negotiations to amend the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law to avert any repeat of the current confused circumstances surrounding the current recount.
Now Taiwan has become something of a diplomatic afterthought because it no longer makes trouble.
He has eased tensions with China by focusing on what both sides can agree upon.
But each side’s interests need not be mutually exclusive.
This may require that the Taiwanese abandon their tendency to hold regular referenda to show that they enjoy this right.
This diplomatic strike occurred at roughly the same time that Taiwan was failing - for the thirteenth time - in its bid to re-enter the United Nations, having been expelled when China was admitted in 1971.
Frustrated by a lack of recognition, popular disgust in Taiwan with terms like "China" and "Chinese" is rising.
Alarmed by a potential conflict between the two archrivals, the Bush administration urged Chen, who won a second term in March, to exercise restraint.
It is imperative for both economies that direct transport links be established immediately.
It is the deepest countryside.
In our village, there used to be two of every shop – butcher’s shop, bakery, hardware store.
Thanks to our television, we have of course been able to witness signs of progress elsewhere.
At home, meanwhile, small, distinctively French businesses – cheese makers, patisseries, or restaurateurs – get hammered by heavy taxes and social-welfare costs while supermarkets flourish selling products from Asia.
True, nobody has been killed by a nuclear weapon since the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 65 years ago this month.
And there is the disconcerting prospect that new civil nuclear-energy players will insist on building uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing plants of their own, rightly described as “bomb starter kits.”
The messages must be stark: nuclear weapons are not only the most indiscriminately inhumane weapons ever invented, but the only ones capable of destroying life on this planet as we know it. Carbon dioxide can also kill us, but not as quickly as bombs.
Indeed, as far as protecting the public is concerned, drug safety is the regulator’s neglected stepchild.
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are made by a drug company, which stands to benefit from sales, or a patient at risk of suffering a serious adverse effect.
It is especially difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a drug if the medical event is common in the user’s age group or in the condition being treated.
It is unfair to blame clinicians for serious ADR’s, particularly in the absence of complete safety information.
Taking Hope in the Long View
For the first time, more than half of the world will have enough food not to be hungry, enough shelter not to be wet, enough clothing not to be cold, and enough medical care not to be worried that they and most of their children will die prematurely of micro-parasites.
But what was shipped back from America across the Atlantic to Europe – and what was paid for in imports from Asia with American products – was never real wealth.
Third – and in large part a consequence of the other two – the rise of the professional inventor and the industrial research laboratory created a class of people whose business was not to make and apply a single invention, but to invent the process of continuous and constant invention and innovation itself.
An ambitious new plan, called the Integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea, launched this month by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, aims to step up existing interventions and pool global efforts, with the goal of reducing the number of deaths from pneumonia to less than three children per 1,000, and of diarrhea-related deaths to below one in 1,000.
That is why we now need the Integrated Global Action Plan.
To date, GAVI has helped countries immunize more than 13 million children against pneumococcal disease and five million children against rotavirus, with plans to strengthen its efforts in countries where immunization coverage is below 70%.
Technology, in particular, is changing the nature of work itself, rendering entire sectors and occupations obsolete, while creating completely new industries and job categories.
As technology increasingly takes over knowledge-based work, the cognitive skills that are central to today’s education systems will remain important; but behavioral and non-cognitive skills necessary for collaboration, innovation, and problem solving will become essential as well.
Policymakers must use stronger metrics to assess human capital and reexamine investment in education, curriculum design, hiring and firing practices, women’s integration into the workforce, retirement policies, immigration legislation, and welfare policies.
Pakistani army commandos fought the intruders for several hours before killing the last attacker.
More recently, however, three crucial developments have altered the environment in which Islamic extremists operate in Pakistan.
A former senior World Bank official, Ghani is interested not only in finding a durable solution to the problem of Islamic extremism, but also in setting his country on a path of sustainable economic development.
Afghanistan was the only state that opposed Pakistan’s entry into the United Nations when it gained independence from British rule in 1947, contributing to nearly 70 years of bilateral tensions.
They are worth considering.
Climate economists widely acknowledge that there are only four policy levers that can be used in an attempt to lower carbon emissions and rein in climate change: reducing the world’s population, shrinking the global economy, increasing the efficiency of energy consumption, and decreasing carbon intensity (meaning that we create less carbon for each unit of energy that we produce).
“In short,” the report notes, “we need to ignite…an energy technology revolution.”
The issue of negotiating a rapprochement between Afghanistan’s government and the Taliban is undoubtedly controversial.
The Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan are closely integrated at the operational level, with al-Qaeda members embedded in most important Taliban field operations.
Human rights groups suspect that even if the Afghan government and Taliban representatives profess to respect the constitution in any future peace agreement, they will not enforce some of its provisions in practice.
Taming “Speculative Capitalism”
To be sure, Sarkozy is right to note the enormous risks that workers and their communities face in this rapidly globalizing world.
In an article last year in the US journal Foreign Affairs , Alan Blinder, a former advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice-Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board, argued that the process of globalization has the potential to cause massive job loss in the future.
In fact, Blinder’s proposal is only one of many possible government policies aimed at dealing with the Internet-age turmoil in the market for jobs and livelihoods.
The financial sector and its free-market ideology had brought the world to the brink of ruin.
But, as plausible as this line of reasoning may sound, the historical evidence repeatedly refutes it.
In Europe, especially Germany, and in some quarters in the US, as government deficits and debt grow, so, too, do calls for increased austerity.
There are other measures that might help.
Taming financial markets will not be easy, but it can and must be done, through a combination of taxation and regulation – and, if necessary, government stepping in to fill some of the breaches (as it already does in the case of lending to small- and medium-size enterprises.)
The funds now rely heavily on investment from pension funds, and on money borrowed from banks and other non-private sources.
Annual profits have since risen to £190 million, but 6,000 workers have been laid off and both costs and waiting times for AA members needing its vehicle repair and recovery services have increased.
But the tide is turning against him.
We can enact measures in each of our member states and in the EU, but coordinated action by the EU and the US would be a realistic start.
Serious discussions are needed to reach EU-wide and inter-governmental agreements, and to encourage the US to move in the same direction.
Empirical studies have identified a connection between the level of executive selling and earnings manipulation – both legal and illegal.
With such advance disclosure, any inside information that the executive has when making the sale decision could emerge and become incorporated into the stock price before the payoff from the sale is determined.
BRUSSELS – Three years ago, Sri Lanka elected Mahinda Rajapaksa as president because he pledged to take the offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the guerillas who have been fighting for 25 years to carve out an independent homeland for the country’s Tamil minority.
So they have little incentive to demobilize.
Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of rebuilding Sri Lanka’s war-ravaged north and reconciling the Tamils at a time of global recession.
The alternative to such a political compromise may be a return to the tragic and bloody secessionist course that the Tigers sought for so long.
In this respect, Sri Lanka’s ability to maintain its democracy throughout decades of war gives reason for hope.
Of the world's six billion people, more than 50% live in cities and towns.
This situation will be aggravated by some of the dangers associated with a global economy led by the financial sector.
With this in mind, we used a new planning tool that allows building rights to drift. This means that we can preserve acreage for watersheds, parks, or other environmental or historical sites, but allow property owners to sell and transfer their building rights elsewhere.
It is the citizens of urban enclaves who are taking part in establishing budget priorities and counseling government through a decentralized policy of administration.
They paid no heed to the large drag that Bush's unbalancing of America's public finances will impose on the US economy over the next several decades.
At this point, I as a pundit am supposed to come up with my magic plan, my clever scheme for fixing things and putting the world to rights.
LONDON – In the early 1970’s, Saudi Arabia’s King Faisal reportedly confided to senior members of the royal family his fear that, just as in a single generation the country had moved from “riding camels to riding Cadillacs….the next generation could be riding camels again.”
The deterioration of Saudi Arabia’s political influence has contributed to a growing sense of national decline.
And some factions of the Saudi family are reaching out – albeit cautiously – to civil-society actors, attempting to engage them in a dialogue about the country’s future.
The continued absence of resolute action could easily drive Saudi Arabia toward irreversible decay.
गैर-संचारी रोगों को लक्ष्य बनाना
स्वास्थ्य के क्षेत्र में अपने अनुभव के आधार पर मैं इस निष्कर्ष पर पहुँचा हूँ कि गैर-संचारी रोगों से उत्पन्न चुनौतियों के संबंध में कार्रवाई करने में दो महत्वपूर्ण कारक उपयोगी सिद्ध होंगे। पहली और सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि प्रगति ऐसे कारगर और स्थानीय दृष्टिकोणों को तैयार करने पर निर्भर करेगी जिन्हें अपनाया जा सके, दोहराया जा सके, और बढ़ाया जा सके। मधुमेह या हृदय रोग जैसी समस्याओं के लिए सभी के लिए एक ही समाधान जैसी कोई स्थिति नहीं हो सकती। लेकिन यह देखते हुए कि गैर-संचारी रोग दुनिया भर के सभी भागों के समुदायों को प्रभावित करते हैं, ऐसा बहुत अधिक समान धरातल मौजूद है जिसकी लगातार दुबारा खोज करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है।

Even before the current crisis, Latin America’s recent “left turn” in politics was tied to the food problem.
On April 23, Brazil announced a temporary suspension of rice exports to prevent internal shortages.
Mexico, Peru, and other nations were suspicious of the anti-American rhetoric of the ALBA grouping, but some practical proposals – such as the creation of a bank of agricultural products to reduce costs for small and midsize producers – have come out of it.
But too little taxation can do the same.
Rates and rules for personal and corporate income taxes appear reasonable by international standards.
For instance a "concessionary duty rate" of 8% is levied on categories like food products, matches, cotton yarn, and computers.
As evasion increases, governments levy "additional" or "special" duties, inciting further evasion.
India's new Congress-led government, too, seems to favor these proposals.
If rich countries in Europe and North American cannot effectively tax the rich, they have little chance of preserving social democracy and offsetting the surge in inequality that has recently afflicted their economies.
The resulting lax enforcement accounts for a large portion of the one-third decline in the effective reach of the US corporate income tax since the late 1990s.
Zucman, for his part, favors a single global registry – a publicly accessible database detailing the ownership of financial instruments.
At the same time, sources of income have become more mobile: There is an increasing focus on intangible assets and mobile investment income that can easily be “optimized” from a tax point of view and transferred abroad.
This approach can also serve as a global governance model for resolving international problems.
In the future, virtually all of the information connected to a bank account will be reported to the tax authorities of the account holder’s country, including the account holder’s name, balance, interest and dividend income, and capital gains.
It leads to misallocations – and will ultimately reduce prosperity around the world.
Policy advisers argued that gaining Israel’s trust was necessary to win support for a European role in the peace process.
This is partly why Israel prefers the United States as sole mediator, and it is also why Israel’s acceptance of a monopoly role for the US evaporates as soon as any American president starts developing views different from its own.
In plain English, an “occupation tax” is needed.
This can be done if Europe supports investigations of suspected war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed by the IDF, as well as the establishment of international tribunals when such crimes occur.
But none of this was persuasive enough for Indiana primary voters, who backed his rival, State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, by an astonishing 20-point margin.
One television advertisement said it all about the low-rent cynicism of the Tea Party-driven campaign.
There was nothing like a perfectly understandable, “Sorry, we misunderstood, and are only prepared now for a bilateral session.
To be sure, the Tea Party’s brand of aggrieved populism – and its composition of mostly white, angry, middle-class voters – has deep roots in the United States, flaring up during times of change.
They view the Democrats and the Republicans alike as obstacles to change, drowning out the voices of the people as they kowtow to special interests.
For once, a grassroots movement has arisen that is composed of people – some with Ivy League degrees, but many without – who are taking seriously the Internet-age promise that you don’t have to yield leadership to an established class of politicians and pundits.
Teaching PIIGS to Fly
And the euro’s appreciation in recent years – driven in part by the European Central Bank’s excessively tight monetary policy – was the final nail in the competitiveness coffin.
The most successful programs undertaken in the presence of a risk of a fiscal and/or external debt financing crisis were those – as in Mexico, Turkey, and Brazil – where a large amount of liquidity/financing support by the IMF beefed up an increasingly credible commitment to adjustment and reform.
But that is precisely why a credible IMF program that ties financial support to the progressive achievement of fiscal and structural reform goals is the right way to teach Greece and the other PIIGS how to fly.
The difference is that this revolution's impact will be even greater.
Every industry will be at risk of being turned on its head.
On balance, the impact of technological progress will be positive.
The latest wave of technological change is far from cresting.
“The Turk” won games against the likes of Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin, while challenging many great minds to penetrate its secrets.
My Harvard colleague Kenneth Froot and I once studied the relative price movements of a number of goods over a 700-year period.
But it does not have to be that way.
Amazon, having swept away bookshops, is now laying siege to the rest of the retail sector.
Acorns, launched in 2014, already manages more than 650,000 investment accounts. The company – and others like it – are not just moving into the market; the simplified investment and savings processes they offer are expanding and transforming it.
But it would be premature to conclude that traditional banking has yielded to new financial platforms. Many of the new entrants have benefited from advantages that would be difficult to maintain were they to scale up in size and importance.
Where Will All the Workers Go?
Even the shop floor can be swept better and cheaper by a Roomba robot than by any worker.
Job-reducing technological innovations will affect education, health care, government, and even transportation. For example, will we still need so many teachers in the decades to come if the cream of the profession can produce increasingly sophisticated online courses that millions of students can take?
Child labor was abolished throughout the developed world, working hours and conditions became more humane, and a social safety net was put in place to protect vulnerable workers and stabilize the (often fragile) macroeconomy.
Without intending to (or at least without highlighting it), the survey’s authors were illuminating the distinction between knowing how to do something and actually doing it in and for the world.
In our human world, knowledge and capability imply some responsibility: If you are able-bodied and you see a person in front of you walk into the path of an oncoming car, you have a responsibility to pull that person to safety.
Countries will increasingly find that their priorities must reflect broad public sentiment rather than that of a ruling elite.
Around the entire planet, we are approaching some kind of singularity, with the market pandering to our fundamental short-term natures by offering us instant gratification and long-term destruction.
Such technologies also have critical medical uses. Simple nuclear-derived kits accelerated the detection of the Ebola virus during the recent outbreak in West Africa.
Moreover, developing countries must be allowed to determine their own priorities, and lead the way in pursuing them. Developed countries should support these efforts by transferring expertise and know-how, not simply by supplying the hardware.
CAMBRIDGE – Since the dawn of the industrial age, a recurrent fear has been that technological change will spawn mass unemployment.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, worldwide, technological change could easily lead to the loss of 5-10 million jobs each year.
Thanks partly to the availability of computer programs and online matches, there has been a mini-boom in chess interest among young people in many countries.
Technological change is not all upside, and transitions can be painful.
Humans are not horsies.
But, in Italy, one man, Mario Monti, is already making a difference.
In France, too, citizens have no illusions.
The fifth source of optimism is slightly paradoxical.
The seventh reason to believe in Europe is linked to the universalism of its message and languages.
The Greek crisis may be forcing Europe to move towards greater integration, with or without Greece.
Today’s feverish hand-wringing reflects a confluence of worries – especially concerns about inflation, excess investment, soaring wages, and bad bank loans.
Wherewithal to deliver. China’s commitment to stability has teeth.
Fears of excess investment and “ghost cities” fixate on the supply side, without giving due weight to burgeoning demand.
Education. China has taken enormous strides in building human capital.
Today’s cottage industry of China doubters is a case in point.
In the light of the Halabja atrocity, and the regime’s broader genocidal Anfal campaign against the Kurds, and massive repression throughout the country, the question “Is Iraq better off now than it was under Saddam Hussein?” requires no great deliberation.
The Sunni Arab parties initially rejected any notion of a confederated state, but in time they came to believe that the Shia parties would never share power voluntarily.
As for the economy, no one expected a replication of Germany’s post-1945 Wirtschaftswunder.
Incompetence and corruption are rampant: Iraq routinely scores among the bottom ten countries in Transparency International’s list of the most corrupt countries in the world.
CAMBRIDGE – Al Qaeda’s attack on the United States ten years ago was a profound shock to both American and international public opinion.
During the Cold War, the US had been even more vulnerable, in technological terms, to a nuclear attack from Russia, but “mutual assured destruction” prevented the worst by keeping vulnerability more or less symmetrical.
Even so, the elimination of top Al Qaeda leaders, the strengthening of American intelligence, tighter border controls, and greater cooperation between the FBI and the CIA have all clearly made the US (and its allies) safer.
To the extent that the trillion or more dollars of unfunded war costs contributed to the budget deficit that plagues the US today, Bin Laden was able to damage American hard power.
Above all, much depends on the policies adopted by the two largest economies, China and the United States, and their cooperation and leadership in creating global public goods and maintaining a stable and open economic environment.
In the past, the US brought a large open market, foreign direct investment, and technology, while China supplied low-cost labor-intensive components in key global manufacturing supply chains.
Fair, rules-based competition in a rapidly expanding global economy is far from a zero-sum game.
China’s GDP is projected to catch up to that of the US and Europe in 10-15 years, at which point (if not sooner) both Chinese and US real GDP will exceed $25 trillion (in 2012 prices), more than three times China’s current GDP.
At the same time, we are on the threshold of a new era when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force and provides fresh impetus for our external action.
The EU's joint civilian-military approach makes us flexible and able to offer tailor-made solutions to complex problems.
We have made a real difference in Africa, helping, for example, to provide a secure environment for elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo and protecting refugees and aid workers from the fall-out of the Darfur crisis.
Our ESDP missions have taken us as far afield as Aceh, Indonesia, where we monitored the peace agreement reached after the 2004 tsunami, following decades of civil war.
Clearer priorities and more sensible budgeting decisions are needed.
In 1918, Oswald Spengler published The Decline of the West.
This is not the “peripheral” trouble that Francis Fukuyama envisioned in his 1989 manifesto “The End of History.”
It is unlikely that US policymaking reflects the grip of some ideal view of the world, in which getting rid of dictators is the same thing as creating democracies.
Fitting a rising power into a decaying international system has rarely occurred peacefully.
But I doubt it.
Agreement is uncertain.
This dilemma underscores the difficulty in crafting a democratization strategy for so vast a region as "the Greater Middle East," which stretches from Mauritania to Pakistan.
The priority in fighting terrorism should be police and intelligence service cooperation, which produces much faster results and limits the capacity of extremists to mobilize.
· Capitalize on institutional diversity. Because NATO and the EU share complementary priorities, both can develop mechanisms for inclusive security cooperation in peacekeeping operations.
9/11 remains the date that has come to signify modern terrorism in all of its terrible capacity to cause death and destruction.
None of this should make anyone sanguine.
Similarly, elections in Palestine did not persuade Hamas to turn its back on violence any more than elections in Lebanon dissuaded Hezbollah from initiating the current crisis in the Middle East.
Terrorism can now be carried out with boxcutters and airplanes as easily as with explosives.
The aim must be to create an environment in which terrorism is seen as neither acceptable nor necessary.
The French Climate-Terror Connection
The surge in carbon dioxide emissions has been fueled not just by industrialization; the UN expects Earth’s human population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100.
After all, to improve their health and preserve their environment, people need access to information about birth-control methods, modern farming and cooking practices, and much else. And to improve their economic prospects, they need the knowledge and skills that employers require.
For starters, there is the sheer scale of the humanitarian catastrophe. Since 2009, Boko Haram alone has killed more than 10,000 people in Nigeria and has driven nearly a half-million from their homes.
In April, the country was granted $170 million in debt relief – the payoff for years of economic reform. But now it is being forced to use part of its hard-won fiscal space to finance the fight against terror.
Testing America’s Financial Stability
Under the new act, a systemic risk regulator has been established, oversight of the shadow banking sector has been strengthened, and new mechanisms have been created to deal with the failure of systemically important non-banks.
Third, reducing systemic risks will require determined action to ensure that financial institutions are not too big to fail.
Most people are surprised to learn that rigorous application of formal rules of evidence to evaluate medical research and decide on the best treatments is a recent phenomenon.
Similarly, cardiologists once prescribed drugs to reduce sudden death in patients after heart attacks.
Public funding also benefits a country’s economy, because large employers are spared the expense of providing health benefits to their workers.
While for-profit providers have higher administrative costs and larger executive salaries, their main burden relative to not-for-profit provision is the need to generate returns for their shareholders.
Russian bombs and missiles are now raining down on an array of armed groups that have been fighting Syrian government forces, which has given the regime the breathing space that Russia’s intervention was intended to provide.
Indeed, there have been reports of the Islamic State moving into areas that others have abandoned following Russian attacks.
Even this modest aim will prove costly, because the Islamic State is also becoming stronger.
A Syria of enclaves or cantons may be the best possible outcome for now and the foreseeable future.
Yet considerable uncertainty remains about the magnitude of the impact of rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases on temperatures and climate.
To prevent further climate change, the IPCC believes, emissions should be brought down to 2.3 tons per person globally, or roughly half the current per capita average, in the next 50 to 75 years.
This is one reason why successful mitigation at the global level faces stiff headwinds.
This will surely involve sharp cuts in the consumption of fossil fuels, bolstered by taxes and other restrictions.
Indeed, there is no need to embellish the political message for China.
Instead of multi-party politics, Mill favored democratic elections constrained by such mechanisms as extra votes for the educated and institutional mechanisms to protect the rights of minorities.
As it happens, the Chinese Communist Party is becoming more meritocratic.
Instead, for a half-century, an unspoken social contract among four broad groups has held Thailand together: the “Palace” – a euphemism used here to avoid violating draconian lèse majesté laws; big business, the custodian of economic growth; the military, which ensures, first and foremost, the sanctity of the Palace and the moral values it represents; and the common people, mostly rural and urban poor, who accept the rule of the other three estates.
In the current crisis, army generals have told the public that they are reluctant to use force, a position that was not theirs to take.
Such wrenching sights are typically accompanied by the pungent odor of a sewage system that is more a problem than a solution, especially during the rainy season.
The red shirts are not blind to Thaksin’s excessive corruption.
More than 60 people, including two foreign reporters and a few soldiers, died in the Thai army’s suppression of the urban rebellion.
It is entirely plausible that Thaksin did help finance the protest.
This patronizing view conveniently ignores the fact that in the last four elections, Thaksin and his allies won by lopsided margins.
But the country’s underclasses must see long-overdue and concrete changes in the right direction – that is, furthering what Thaksin tried to do.
While the rural population had more than enough to eat, their economic opportunities and upward mobility were limited by a shoddy education system and docile state-run media that fed them soap operas and official messages.
Thai Rak Thai’s populism featured income redistribution, cheap health care, micro-credit schemes, and a dazzling array of policy innovations that ushered Thailand into twenty-first-century globalization.
In the process, what had been a pro- and anti-Thaksin fight has gradually become a pro- and anti-monarchy struggle.
The reds will need to distance themselves from Thaksin’s abuses of power as much as the yellows will have to accept some of Thaksin’s policy legacy, particularly grassroots opportunities for jobs, education, and upward mobility.
The current crisis has been brewing for some time, but the breaking point came when anti-government protestors occupied Bangkok’s main airport.
Once in power, he essentially shut them out of the “grabbing” game, preserving it for himself and his cronies.
These protests have run, on and off, for nearly 200 days, with crowd sizes ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands.   It is widely known that the anti-Thaksin business elites provided the money to keep people in the street.
HONG KONG – Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was gracious when he ended his exile in Hong Kong: “Thank you, Hong Kong, for having me here, so warmly.
None of the four “tiger” economies – Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea – were as blessed with natural resources and fertile soil.
Yet several South Korean companies, such as Samsung and Hyundai, have become global household names competing successfully against far more established brands, such as Sony and Honda.
Competition is not a zero-sum game.
But how realistic is it to expect so driven and flamboyant a man to stay away from the limelight?
Thaksin’s ownership of the Manchester City football club might not seem of great importance to observers outside Thailand and Asia. But Thais are soccer enthusiasts and even bigger fans of the English Premier League.
The situation is all the more uncertain in view of a problem facing the PPP.
In Russia, the task is especially problematic, because the ruling elite’s interests run counter to undertaking it.
Vertical industrial policy, horizontal industrial policy, investment in education – all have been tried in the last ten years.
So far, the government does not want to let control over these firms get into private hands.
That Old Tax Magic
Romney wants to cut tax rates, mainly benefiting those at the upper end of the income distribution.
Everyone has an agenda, perceived or real.
If one presidential candidate refuses to cooperate in this manner, that should confer an advantage on the candidate who is willing to disclose more fully the specifics of his plan.
Then came Japan’s terrible earthquake, which severely damaged both its economy and global supply chains.
Global risk-aversion has also increased, as the option of further “extend and pretend” or “delay and pray” on Greece is becoming less desirable, and the specter of a disorderly workout is becoming more likely.
Indeed, inflation may even force the Bank to raise interest rates by the fall.
If that happens, the risk of stall speed or an outright double-dip recession would rise sharply in many advanced economies.
Before 1986, there were brokers, acting for clients, and jobbers, making a market, and never the twain could meet.
(Full disclosure: I was an adviser to Lawson in the 1980’s).
Thatcher was referring specifically to the dangers of fixed exchange rates, and can certainly not be counted as one of the principal architects of the so-called “efficient markets hypothesis.”
Her Alan Greenspan-like belief in the self-correcting features of financial markets, and her reverence for the integrity of the price mechanism, do not look as well-founded today as they did in the 1980’s.
But by now, the decline has become nearly universal, with huge implications for global asset markets.
But Glassman and Hassett did have a point.
To my mind, though, the greatest risk is geopolitical instability. By and large, China has been a far more constructive counterpart to the US than the former Soviet Union ever was.
The Chinese are no strangers to Rwanda.
One big change is in education.
Of course, technology transfer from China and India could be a mere smokescreen for a new “brown imperialism” aimed at exploiting African oil, food, and minerals.
Americans do-gooders like Nicholas Negroponte, with his $100 laptop, have identified the right problem: Africa is way behind technologically and rapid leap-frogging is possible.
When, in the 1970’s, the Club of Rome issued its famous report on the “Limits to Growth,” the reaction was one of concern.
Steadily rising prices of raw materials, agricultural products, and energy already reflect fears about future shortages.
The same pattern holds true for Europe and Japan, albeit on a slightly smaller scale.
Human population has simply become too large to be able to afford it.
This is precisely what needs to change.
And, like past insurgencies, the Iraq conflict is one in which the insurgents use horrific acts to intimidate the public, expose the shortcomings of the government, and goad the regime into overreactions that might turn the public against it.
Multiple insurgencies co-exist in time and space, each with differing objectives and tactics.
Finally, the insurgency as a whole remains nihilistic, focused on destroying the new Iraqi government and the emerging economic and political system rather than articulating a coherent alternative.
It is not clear at this point how much determination Iraq’s emerging democratic leaders will have.
The deeper the plunge, the stronger the rebound, some analysts say.
If authorities set the clock back several decades on banking regulation, can we be so sure they will not also set the clock back on income?
Chinese growth is set to slow over the longer run, as well.
Assuming continuing reforms in countries such as Brazil, India, South Africa, and Russia, emerging markets could well fill some of the growth gap left by the largest economies.
Africa’s poverty rate in 2003 exceeds that of the next poorest region, South Asia, by 17 percentage points.
In 2004, for example, Chad’s 39.4% annual growth rate contrasted sharply with Zimbabwe’s -6.8% economic contraction.
In 2004, only six countries – Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Ethiopia, Angola and Mozambique – had annual growth rates higher than 7%.
Moreover, there must be greater balance between capital-intensive and labor-intensive activities.
For Americans, especially, it was the totemic emblem of victory in the Cold War.
“When does it take effect?” reporters asked. Confused, Schabowski neglected the all-important date: “ sofort ,” he said.
The Communists, not the people, would have done it.
Finally, it gave way and was hoisted above the crowds, twisting slowly, as if from a gibbet.
The answer seems to consist in those countless individual choices at key moments, the accidents of human messiness, such as Schabowski’s “botch,” so small and so understandable, yet so earthshaking. Among them, too, were the choices of courageous protestors to go into the streets, to speak out – or, as this particular protestor put it to me, not to have to explain to the next generation, “We sat and waited.”
Another year passed before his office issued indictments against high-ranking figures responsible for major crimes.
It also provided impetus to the establishment of the International Criminal Court, while encouraging prosecutors in many countries to charge senior officials and guerrilla leaders for war crimes and bring them to trial in national courts.
Her mother, Mrs. Watanabe, is known for moving the world’s markets with the financial trading that occupies her breaks from housework.
The only difference from her mother’s era was that today’s generation quit, married, and gave birth later.
Previously, the LDP had given barely a second thought to women’s issues, focusing only on the needs of business and dealing with an aging society. Now, to Ms. Watanabe’s surprise, it has made women’s policy one of the key aspects of its long-term strategy.
Abe has said that “womanomics” is the most important pillar of “Abenomics,” his government’s growth strategy.
To him, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is another Hitler, and the world is now facing the same challenges that it faced on the eve of Hitler’s rise to power.
Begin was the best proof that Israel’s critics needed that the Zionist revolution, although it created a state out of the ashes of the Holocaust, had failed to eradicate the collective self-image of the Jew and the Israeli as victim.
When he did not feel the need to exploit the solemnity of Holocaust remembrance ceremonies, Barak conveyed the right message to the rising Iranian power.
A Year of Reckoning for France and Europe
Hollande’s government insists that we will be successful only if three conditions are met.
Our duty is to rise to the occasion and reverse the tide.
We have designed the corporate-tax credit to maximize its positive impact on the economy: labor costs will fall immediately without depressing aggregate demand in 2013, because the spending cuts (€10 billion) and household tax increases that will fund the credit will begin only in 2014.
The Accidental Empire
When financial markets discovered that supposedly riskless government bonds might be forced into default, they raised risk premiums dramatically.
This trend has gathered momentum in recent months.
The political and social dynamics are also working toward disintegration.
German authorities are working feverishly to come up with a set of proposals in time for the European Union summit at the end of June, but all signs suggest that they will offer only the minimum on which the various parties can agree – implying, once again, only temporary relief.
When the German people become aware of the consequences –&nbsp;one hopes not too late – they will want to correct the defects in the euro's design.
If Western women have learned anything in the past 40 years, it is how to be unsatisfied with the status quo – an important insight for the rest of the world, as we seek to export Western-style feminism.
Many men and women in the rest of the world – especially in the developing world – observe this in us and are ambivalent about it.
It is not necessarily a victory for women – or men – that, 40 years on, professional women are just as exhausted as professional men traditionally have been.
Perhaps seeing how futile it is to rest one’s sense of self on externalized, professionalized achievement is a wake-up call – and a first step to a deeper freedom, and an even deeper sense of feminine destiny.
We must not ignore the grave dangers that it would pose for Pakistan, where a new round of jihadist rhetoric and mobilization could be fatal to hopes of building a stable and more secure country.
It is equally important that Pakistan and India engage in an open dialogue that can establish trust and transparency in their respective policies concerning Afghanistan. Today, this dialogue hardly exists, and their mutual maneuvering, fueled by mistrust, could easily destabilize their weaker neighbor.
What we must do now is create the framework for a more stable Afghanistan, and for sustained international engagement in a region that is crucial for global stability.
But, when communism collapsed in its Eurasian heartland, the West’s rich, believing that they had nothing more to fear, pressed to roll back the welfare state, causing inequality to rise rapidly.
Theirs is a movement of political reform – demanding more freedom and government accountability – not of social protest, at least not yet.
This is becoming particularly relevant today, as the smell of war hangs over Iran.
NEW YORK – The world is speeding up. Communications, travel, and productivity are increasing.
Meth users often develop rotten teeth and horrible scabs caused by scratching themselves due to a sensation of insects crawling under their skin.
That’s one-quarter of all amphetamines seized in the world.
With little initial investment, industrial-scale factories can make huge profits by manufacturing millions of tablets.
Greater regional cooperation is needed to prevent such displacement.
But it is also evidence that the US is trying to pursue the right policy.
If the choice for Islamists is still bullets or ballots, bullets may now look more promising.
The US should therefore declare that it will cut off its aid to Egypt’s military at a specified date unless elections take place.
Over the longer term, an elected government will have to bring enough parts of Egyptian society together to be able to make tough choices about dismantling the military’s corrupt state within a state, cutting subsidies, and rebuilding the economy’s foundations.
The guests that Faisal Qassem brought to the Doha studios (or via satellite) included people from the same Arab country or region but representing completely opposing points of view.
When Al Jazeera reporters interviewed Osama bin Laden and the station broadcast his videos, America’s gloves came off.
Al Jazeera has made Qatar famous and the Arab world better informed. Despite its inadequacies and biases, Al Jazeera has changed the Arab world for the better.
Asian countries have impressive potential resources for soft power.
Japan’s global cultural influence grew in areas ranging from fashion, food, and pop music to consumer electronics, architecture, and art.
Japan’s culture remains inward-looking.
But the real promise for China and India lies in the future.
Indeed, if the US continues to pursue unattractive policies, it may find that its absence from the summit in Malaysia in December is a harbinger of things to come.
When Putin welcomed Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to Russia last September, he observed that, “Latin America is becoming a noticeable link in the chain of the multipolar world that is forming.”
Instead, Russia’s leaders are busy protecting Russian markets, banks, and companies from the worst effects of the global financial crisis, consolidating state control over domestic economic sectors, and extending their foreign-policy leverage across former Soviet territory.
Who, then, can take the lead on efforts to create a new global financial architecture that reflects the complexities of twenty-first-century commerce?
Examples include the war in Iraq, launched by the US on false premises, obstructionism on efforts to curb climate change, meager development assistance, and the violation of international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions.
These anti-scientific approaches affected not only climate policy, but also foreign policy.
They reject geological evidence of climate change because they reject the science of geology itself.
In many statements, Palin seems intent on invoking God in her judgments about war, an ominous sign for the future if she is elected.
The American Leader We Need
A new president’s first task will be to return America’s economic competitiveness and self-confidence. It will not be easy to rein in over-spending and over-borrowing, to restore the real family values of saving, thrift, responsibility, and fair reward.
It won’t work.
In the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered wise advice to the next US president upon his retirement. Israel and Palestine have become, he said, the hopeless and bloody prism through which American diplomacy often seems to see the world.
It is easy to forget how critical things were back in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.
As they intervened, American policymakers consulted closely with their counterparts around the world, urging them to take supportive steps.
And, sensing all of this, companies are beginning to deploy the massive precautionary cash balances that they have accumulated.
For starters, the economy is not yet in a position to handle the 4-5%-of-GDP “fiscal cliff” that is approaching as all of the hard political decisions that were postponed come into view at the end of this year.
The American Way of Debt
This may already be happening: the appreciation of the euro, from $1.20 to $1.30 in the past few months, was enough to bring European growth to a standstill during the third quarter of this year.
The third option is a pick up of growth in Europe, which would increase US exports.
Until this happens, it is in the rest of the world's interest to let the US continue to run an unprecedented current account deficit by financing it at the rate of $500 billion per year.
Indeed, President Nicolas Sarkozy’s willingness to intervene (alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron) helped close a dangerous gap between the world of “values,” which would call for direct American intervention against Muammar el-Qaddafi, and the world of “interest,” which impelled President Barack Obama to restraint.
The view from London contains the same element of “distance” – if not slight apprehension – found in the view from Washington.
At the crossroads of this question stands NATO, an organization perceived as American by Europeans and international (i.e., not American) by the average US citizen.
The Anarchist and the President
Correa, who has tightened the screws on his country’s press, hardly stands as the flag-bearer for the libertarian tradition of the press that Assange, the poster boy of “stateless” journalism, represents.
Indeed, he has virtually written the playbook for discouraging the kind of journalism championed by WikiLeaks.
Fortunately for Assange, a sympathetic president was willing to throw him a lifeline as he floundered in the treacherous waters of international law.
For several months, Russian and Chinese obstruction in the United Nations Security Council was both a real obstacle to more effective sanctions and a convenient veil for inaction.
The army and the security apparatus remain loyal, the cabinet has suffered few defections, and the key population centers of Damascus and Aleppo have not joined the rebellion.
In this context, it is important to appreciate the difference between the “political” opposition and the local opposition groups waging the fight against the regime on the ground.
As the sanctions imposed on Iran outside the Security Council clearly show, effective action can be taken to tilt the balance and end the deadly stalemate in Syria.
China’s leaders oppose stiffer sanctions against North Korea for a simple reason: they fear the frailty of Kim Jong-un’s regime more than they fear the international security consequences of the missile launch.
The primary cause of the regime’s fears is growing political uncertainty, which is the direct result of the failing health of Kim Kyong-hui, Kim Jong-un’s aunt and the power behind the throne.
The Anatomy of Slow Recovery
This is, I think, the best metric to use to quantify the decidedly sub-par pace of today’s jobless recovery in the US.
From an entrepreneurial standpoint, therefore, recovery was a straightforward matter: simply pick up where you left off and do what you used to do.
Unfortunately, the market cannot produce a demand recovery rapidly by itself.
In London, Prime Minister David Cameron is on the offensive.
Indeed, the Bank of England’s latest inflation report makes it clear that, in such a context, interest-rate hikes are likely.
The budget debate is now in full swing.
The question is whether they care about the deficit.
Sometimes the cause is government guarantees. And sometimes it is simply a long run of good fortune, which leaves the market dominated by unrealistic optimists.

Second, regardless of whether modern macroeconomists attribute our current difficulties to causes that are “patently unrealistic” or simply confess ignorance, why do they have such a different view than we economic historians do? Regardless of whether they have rejected our interpretations and understandings or simply have built or failed to build their own in ignorance of what we have done, why have they not used our work?
If modern macroeconomists do not reconnect with history – if they do not realize just what their theories are crystallized out of and what the point of the enterprise is – then their profession will wither and die.
This is a sizeable commitment, but it may not be enough – more needs to be done to increase agricultural production, to free up the potential of trade to address food insecurity, and to deal with the increasing impact of climate change on agriculture.
The impact of biodiversity is often insufficiently understood, which means that we have undervalued its contribution to tackling global challenges.
Next week, when leaders meet in Rome, I hope that we will agree on the key priorities to fight hunger and food insecurity, and in particular to establish an authoritative source of advice on food security to governments and international institutions.
At best, democracy is still off in the distance: the military still dominates in Egypt and Tunisia, tribal forces are on the rise in Libya and Yemen, and sectarian divides between Sunni and Shia are likely to dominate politics in Bahrain, as they have in Iraq since 2003.
Like Egypt’s now-deposed President Hosni Mubarak, al-Zawahiri’s tone was patronizing and condescending.
There is certainly a degree of envy for what others have accomplished and a sense of desperation about how Al Qaeda can capitalize on this change.
The alternative is a world in which we remain hostage to the region’s pathologies, which provide ample opportunity for Al Qaeda to reassert its narrative and influence.
Indeed, exceptions to this pattern are rare: South Africa is one, owing to the genius of one of the century’s most outstanding statesmen, Nelson Mandela.
As if this were not enough, some countries – including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and even tiny (but very rich) Qatar – have ambitions to be regional powers.
Frontline states like Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan will not manage to remain aloof from a disintegrating Syria.
But, as the recent United Nations Security Council debates on the Arab Spring have shown, it is not the major emerging countries that will influence events in the region.
Moreover, the associated MEDA funding mechanism crucially and specifically included the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
Education remains a key area where the EU should contribute to the development of the southern neighborhood, if only because young people are a growing majority of the Arab population.
Europe now faces key decisions that concern both its values and its interests in the Arab world, and the reconciliation of its short- and long-term objectives.
In April 2011, Tunisian women successfully pressed for an electoral-parity law, thanks to which they won 49 of 217 parliamentary seats in last October’s elections.
But the new president, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, has ordered the parliament to reconvene.
The National Council for Women has been restructured, there is a new Egyptian Feminist Union, and a number of coalitions made up of feminist NGOs have been created.
An immense effort would be required of women’s-rights activists to be prevent a reign of injustice.
And in Libya, while getting rid of Muammar el-Qaddafi is a good first step, democracy and the rule of law are, to be optimistic, years away.
But what about the more frequent Sunni attacks? Where is their support coming from?

Perhaps, given the ongoing turmoil in the Arab world, security services that had previously – though sometimes reluctantly – shut down these money flows are now distracted by other, more immediate, problems.
Being descendants of the Prophet, as in Morocco and Jordan, or having custodianship of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as in Saudi Arabia, bestows a legitimacy on the countries’ rulers that is directly linked to Islam.
So the tremendous victory of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Al-Nour Party in Egypt – as well as that of Ennahda in Tunisia – should come as no surprise.
That has changed, and we see the region’s imperially imposed frontiers being called into question.
The end of communist autocracies in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and even Czechoslovakia brought about a dramatic wave of state creation.
· a monopoly over the use of legitimate force;
Moreover, Arafat contributed to the absence of a legitimate monopoly of force by ignoring the semi-autonomous armed actions of his own Fatah-based militia, as well as the Fatah-based Al–Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, not to mention other groups’ armed militias.
Palestine also has a powerful women’s movement (Palestine being the first Arab country to give women the vote, in 1946).
But this was an asymmetrical peace. Both countries recognized Israel, but Israel did not recognize Palestine, and Israel’s construction of settlements on occupied land continued.
The predominant image is of a passive, exotic, and veiled victim-woman who reacts to events instead of actively participating in them. She is an impersonal object of communal stereotypes that sustain cultural prejudices.
This new family model has gained so much force that it is imposing itself on rural society, too, where the decline of the agrarian economy is accompanied by a strong shift towards smaller families.
The result is widespread invocation by governments of religious norms, and to a lesser extent references to tradition, in order to legitimize the continuation of patriarchal rule.
LONDON – Economic want and inequality, as much as political repression, incited the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions.
Although birth rates are falling, one-third of the overall population is below 15 years old, and large numbers of young women are reaching reproductive age, or soon will be.
The worldwide cost of infrastructure capable of responding to the intensifying water crisis could amount to trillions of dollars, and its development would itself be energy-intensive.
All of this means not only that the era of cheap oil is over, but also that, within the next decade or so, major oil-producing countries will struggle against costly geological constraints.
Egypt’s population, for example, more than doubled over the course of Hosni Mubarak’s rule, from 42 million in 1980 to 85 million in 2010.
The problem of high youth unemployment is certainly not confined to the developing world, however.
While the private sector must create most of the jobs, the public sector must create the underlying conditions for high productivity.
The result is a growing youth unemployment crisis among poor and working-class youth.
There can be no better way to use the region’s resources than to ensure that its young people’s lives are enriched by education, skills, and high-quality jobs.
The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces supposedly puts the various Palestinian military, security, and intelligence units under one leader, who is expected to ensure the rule of law.
A worldwide assembly chooses Fatah’s 100-member revolutionary council, which in turn elects a 20-member central committee, where most of the power struggle will take place.
The problem is that no Palestinian leader, no matter who he is, can deliver these changes.
The paradox of fire stems from its role as the great shape-shifter of natural processes.
There is no solution to fire, because there are many kinds of fires, and they change with their context.
Our prevailing templates for describing fire are similarly misdirected.
The nature of such fuel accumulations runs the gamut, including swamp drainage in Indonesia, rainforest destruction in Amazonia, self-thickening woods in American wildlands as a result of fire exclusion, and everywhere the intrusion of urban sprawl and fire-prone houses.
We will win battles but kill crews in a war that does not exist.
That, in a nutshell, is the problem that both Asia and the West face in China, and which has been demonstrated once again at the G20 summit in Canada.
The biggest loser from the global financial crisis, in China’s view, is Uncle Sam. That the US remains dependent on China to buy billions of dollars worth of Treasury bonds every week to finance its yawning budget deficit is a sign of shifting global financial power – which China is sure to use for political gain in the years ahead.
Yet the plain truth is that America’s economic and military travails are crimping its foreign-policy options vis-à-vis China.
By contrast, Japan has remained a fully pacifist economic power.
While the City of London was shaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the run on HBOS, Sotheby’s staged a record-breaking auction for the works of the artist Damien Hirst, which produced a gross take of around $200 million.
Financial judgment, by contrast, is not by its nature open to inspection.
Naïve outsiders found the world of contemporary art bewildering.
One hint was that Russian buyers paid the big money, at the very moment that Russia’s banking system was melting down.
Both American presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, have made clear that they expect the Pakistani government to take action against militants, and that they would be willing to authorize strikes inside Pakistan.
In 2005 alone, EU imports from Pakistan totaled €3.4 billion.
Such a commission, with senior European members, could examine the key issues in the region, visit all countries and players and develop a set of recommendations for a new transatlantic approach to begin in early January 2009 when a new U.S president is in place.
In July 1997, the Thai Baht plummeted. Soon after, financial panic spread to Indonesia and Korea, then to Malaysia.
Today, the global surfeit of liquidity has once again resulted in comparably low risk premia and a resurgence of capital flows, despite a broad consensus that the world faces enormous risks (including the risks posed by a return of risk premia to more normal levels.)
Developing countries have also increasingly borrowed in their own currencies during the last few years, thus reducing their foreign exchange exposure. For those developing countries that remain heavily indebted abroad, an increase in risk premia would almost certainly bring economic turmoil, if not crisis.
It was not an accident that the only two major developing countries to be spared a crisis were India and China.
His novel Autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor, political paralysis, and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator.
The Khrushchev thaw that followed may have been short-lived, but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was opened – a possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized upon in 1985.
Little did Franco realize that what Juan Carlos would build, with the help of a clever young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez, was the modern, democratic Spain of today.
Many observers portray Raúl Castro, Fidel’s younger brother and designated heir, as a pragmatist – the “practical Castro.”
WASHINGTON, DC – Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has now made the mistake that all Iranian presidents make: he has challenged the authority of the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He is doomed to fail.
He has supported factionalization in the government, and, when necessary, has weakened factions that he previously supported. Most importantly, he has ensured that Iran’s presidents remain weak, regardless of their agenda or popularity.
Only those with a strong background in intelligence or the Revolutionary Guards, and a low profile in domestic politics, need apply.
The regime’s propaganda machine is already portraying the Istanbul talks as a triumph for the Islamic Republic and a setback for the West.
Regardless of their outcome, the new negotiations have put Khamenei in a perilous position.
It is an open secret in Iranian political circles that Khamenei also regrets permitting volunteers of the Basij militia to attack the British embassy last November.
The problem for Khamenei – and thus for those negotiating with Iran – is that there is scant benefit for him in success.
When a would-be dictator – anywhere, any time, on the right or the left – wants to close an open society or initiate a crackdown against a democracy movement, he follows ten classic steps: invoke a threat, create secret prisons, develop a paramilitary force, establish a surveillance apparatus, arbitrarily detain citizens, infiltrate citizen groups, target key individuals, go after journalists, call criticism “treason,” and subvert the rule of law.
Iran’s citizens – and all people longing to resist a tyrannical government or to protest in an established democracy – should bear that lesson in mind.
What a real revolution it would be if the Western democracies did indeed begin to frame their foreign policies with human rights and democratic processes as their benchmark.
Even more important has been the growing gap between average (mean) and median income: that is, the proportion of the population living on half or less of the average income in the US and Britain has been growing.
The greater the knowledge, skill, and responsibility attached to a job, the higher the acceptable and accepted reward for doing it.
The attitude of indifference to income distribution is in fact a recipe for economic growth without end, with the rich, very rich, and super-rich drawing ever further ahead of the rest.
Mistaken beliefs, on the other hand, are reflected in metaphors like “contagion” and “domino effect,” which imply that financial markets become blind, virulent, and indiscriminate when they are disturbed.
One group – Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (BELL) – experienced a surge in yields on their government bonds in 2009, followed by a sharp decline.
In Japan, QE may have contributed to delays in economic reform and restructuring, thereby weakening longer-term economic growth and exacerbating fiscal distress.
Slovenia is in the European Union, Croatia is very close to membership, and all of the region’s other countries have started along the EU path.
That is why, at the EU-United States summit held in Prague last year, I proposed an eight-pronged initiative, elements of which have now been fully or partially taken up, including the Conference held in Sarajevo last June where the EU reiterated its commitment to the integration process of the Balkans region as whole.
The EU has offered to play a facilitating role: we urge both leaderships to promptly seize this opportunity, with a view to their states’ further steps along the path towards the European family to which all Balkan countries naturally belong.
But the reality is less re-assuring.
Bosnia and Kosovo are trapped in the labyrinth of the politics of semi-independence; Albania, Montenegro, and Macedonia are small and claustrophobic republics with populist and divisive governments and opposition forces that are discouraged and discouraging at the same time.
Moreover, they no longer know how their economies will be able to grow in post-crisis Europe.
This should change.
Moreover, whereas members of all ethnic groups committed crimes, in its first years, the ICTY indicted and prosecuted far more Serbs than others, fueling a perception, even among opponents of Milosevic’s regime, that the tribunal was political and anti-Serbian.
Holding the trial in Belgrade might have served better to catalyze a sober examination of the past. The atmosphere was certainly favorable.
As one Kosovo Liberation Army commander warned, “If we kill one KFOR soldier a day, these cowards will leave.”
The people of the Balkans should feel that the EU offers them political and economic support.
Compared to Saddam Hussein's murderous old regime at Abu Ghraib, of course, American prisons are relatively well managed.
Texas prison guards regularly rely on excessive force, the judge concluded, officials ignore sexual enslavement, and the state's isolation units function as "virtual incubators of psychoses."
Why do prisons the world over concentrate such suffering and misconduct? Partly by design.
A flurry of investigations will now try to figure out what went disastrously awry at Abu Ghraib.
Twenty years ago, such developments would have interested mostly bankers and businesspeople.
This is monetary policy on steroids, and, to opponents of inflation-inducing money creation, it amounts to playing with fire.
For example, the Fed’s mandate dictates that price stability can be explicitly linked to active support for GDP growth and employment; for the BoE and the ECB, it can be a condition for achieving the broader goal of sustainable growth and employment.
BARCELONA – Central bankers and regulators tend to worry that too much competition in the financial sector increases instability and the risk of systemic failure.
This new vulnerability stands in stark contrast to the stability of the over-regulated post-World War II period.
As a result, investment-banking operations might need to be rescued if they pose a systemic threat.
The crisis has affected both concentrated banking systems (for example, the UK and the Netherlands) and non-concentrated systems (e.g., the US and Germany).
GENEVA – Now that the global financial crisis is abating, it is time to take stock of our mistakes and ensure that they are not repeated.
Clearly the Fund’s surveillance of the US economy was ineffective, and its multilateral surveillance of financial markets no better.
It is inconceivable that the Fund, with its qualified and dedicated staff, would have failed so miserably in detecting and calling attention to the vulnerabilities piling up in the US mortgage market had they occurred in a developing country.
Perhaps most revealingly, though, Rajan nonetheless optimistically argued that “[d]eregulation has removed artificial barriers preventing entry of new firms, and has encouraged competition between products, institutions, markets, and jurisdictions.”
Whereas Tunisia and Egypt are relatively homogeneous countries – Sunni Muslims constitute more than 90% of their inhabitants – Bahrain’s Sunnis, including the royal family and the country’s political and economic elite, comprise only about one-third of the population.
From the turmoil in the 1920’s, following administrative reforms, to labor protests in the 1950’s, the country is accustomed to agitation. As a result, factional strife is unlikely to panic the rulers and is even less likely to persuade them that the king must abdicate to save the country.

A bronze sculpture of the British prime minister had been in the Oval Office of the White House since the 1960’s.
Even Churchill himself did not speak of Anglo-Saxons much. He talked about “the British race” or the “English-speaking peoples.”
Americans, on the whole, have far less interest than the British in the “special relationship.”
Yet he likes to portray himself as a tough patriot, and Obama as an un-American wimp.
So what can be done to promote an “Americanization” of Europe in political terms and a “Europeanization” of America in social terms? Comforted by a new President who incarnates a return of hope, who inspires and reassures at the same time, Americans are starting to believe that the worst of the economic crisis is behind them.
What will they do?
But, above all, Europe suffers from an identity deficit, for no one seems to know what it means to be a European nowadays.
Some observers even speak of a “Turkish Spring.”
There is a strong leftist bent to the Turkish Spring.
Many of the new entrepreneurs, like the women in headscarves, are from villages in Anatolia.
Democracy is good, and so are liberalism and tolerance.
This is no reason to support Erdoğan and his shopping-mall builders against the protesters in Turkey, either.
Most of the previous amendments relied on agreements between governing and opposition parties, and were not put to a popular vote.
Moreover, in a case brought to the Constitutional Court, the AKP’s support for the amendment was used as evidence that the party was violating Turkey’s secular constitution.
Most important among such amendments is the repeal of Provisional Article 15, which has provided immunity from prosecution to all actors of the military regime established by the 1980 coup.
With the campaign dragging on for months, the referendum has thoroughly polarized Turkish politics.
The forces of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych foolishly stuffed ballots and intimidated the country’s electoral commission to an absurd degree.
Ukrainians know that the choice they make now, that their decision to stand firm with Viktor Yushchenko today, will determine their freedom forever, as well as the health of their nation – its independence as well as its economic strength.
We shall persist, and our democracy shall prevail.
But behind it lie two moral attitudes, which are much easier to grasp.
Similarly, before the introduction of limited liability in the nineteenth century, a company’s shareholders or partners were each liable for all of the firm’s debts, which severely restricted businesses’ willingness to borrow to finance trade.
But there is a contrary moral attitude, the essence of which is that, whereas excessive debt is to be deplored, the blame for it lies with the lender, not the borrower.
But in the borrower’s view it is usurious – taking advantage of the borrower’s desperation.
Cambodia insists that the disputed land has been under its territorial sovereignty since a landmark case decided by the International Court of Justice in 1962.
The communiqué became a lightning rod for Thaksin’s opponents at home, spearheaded by the People’s Alliance for Democracy.
The PAD has openly called for a military coup to clean up Thai politics.
Cambodia wants to multilateralize the border conflict as much as Thailand tries to limit it to bilateral negotiations.
Given its immensely greater economic and financial power, America predictably carried the day.
In any case, the only process for acting on such indicators is “peer pressure,” which is unlikely to deliver results.
The world will be better off as a result.
ANN ARBOR – The quality of refereeing at the World Cup had been a source of relief until June 18, when referee Koman Coulibaly of Mali disallowed a perfectly legitimate goal by the United States that would have given it an all-important win over Slovenia.
Alternatively, one could give each team the opportunity to challenge up to two referee decisions per game, employing video replays to review rules infractions and settle disputed calls.
These measures – and many others that include the overdue use of available technology – would augment the effectiveness of often-clueless referees, whose authority has declined sharply with the proliferation of decisive mistakes in major games and championships.
The Beauty in Ugly Elections
The majority of shortcomings resulted from organizational ineptitude.
Despite the new election law's assurance of equal coverage in the main media, government TV channels devoted more time to the pro-government parties.
Indeed, many opposition groups engaged in dirty tricks.
Turnout was relatively high, at 57% of registered, particularly given that the OSCE had intoned that "public interest does not seem to be high"; other experts wrote of "voter fatigue."
Equally important, no newspapers were closed, stories suppressed, or journalists harassed, as occurred in earlier Kazakh elections.
The debate has been most intense in the United States, where the refrain that the Constitution is not a “suicide pact” and that national security can justify extraordinary measures is heard repeatedly.
When his trial began, the prosecution tried to exclude Hamdan from the room during the testimony of a witness against him.
In order to resolve the question of whether conspiracy constitutes a crime under the laws of war, Justice Stevens followed the arguments made in the brief that I submitted on behalf of Experts on Conspiracy and the Law of War.
Conspiracy, by contrast, is suited to a legal system that emphasizes early police intervention, before criminal plans are carried out.
By contrast, India, with its firmly rooted liberal democracy, smells to some like roses.
For starters, in 2004, the Congress was challenging an incumbent government that had served for six years.
The Congress will inevitably be under acute pressure to perform, as the electorate now knows that better performance is not beyond its grasp.
Indeed, the Nehru-Gandhi condominium that has dominated Indian politics has itself undermined the party’s survival prospects by making it immensely difficult for it to recruit and develop new leaders.
These concerns are unwarranted, and discriminatory policies to restrict such investment are ill-advised.
First, China has an understandable interest in diversifying its substantial holdings of foreign-exchange reserves away from low-yielding US Treasuries to real productive assets with higher returns.
First, like all mergers and acquisitions involving both domestic and foreign investors, investments in or acquisitions of US companies by Chinese companies, whether state-owned or private, must be evaluated by the US Justice Department for their impact on market competition.

In the United States, Republicans propose to balance the budget within ten years by reforming entitlement spending and taxes (with fewer exemptions, deductions, and credits providing the revenue needed to reduce personal tax rates and a corporate rate that, at 35%, is the highest in the OECD).
Such circumstances include, first, a high debt/GDP ratio, with rising interest rates impeding growth.
After all, the current American and European economies differ in important ways from the other post-war cases – size, simultaneous consolidation in many countries, already-low interest rates, and the dollar’s status as the main global reserve currency.
While consolidation may imply some short-term costs, especially in a recession, the long-term costs of delay are large.
I thought otherwise, based on research underlying my 2009 book with Carmen M. Reinhart, This Time is Different.
As William McChesney Martin, who served as Fed Chairman in the 1950’s and 1960’s, once quipped, the central bank’s job is “to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.”
The BOJ would be right to worry, of course, if interest rates were rising because of a growing risk premium, rather than because of higher inflation expectations.
They should be spiking the punch bowl more, not taking it away.
Indeed, accurate maps break down geographic barriers, empowering individuals to reach their desired destinations, enabling businesses to reach consumers anywhere, and enriching people’s outlooks.
A keen cyclist might want a map showing bicycle paths, including information about the terrain.
To advance the world’s geographic knowledge, explorers used to have to head out to sea, enduring inclement weather and debilitating disease, unsure of where they were going – or whether they would ever return home.
At the same time, an estimated two billion people will move to cities in the next quarter-century.
For example, changes in financial markets (including the large amounts of money in sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds) provide opportunities for new development partnerships, which the New Development Bank can help to catalyze and orchestrate.
But, with the shortfall of assistance from developed to developing countries, the new bank can provide essential help to developing countries and emerging markets as they undertake smarter and more sustainable infrastructure investment for growth and poverty reduction.
These innovations have helped keep the US-China economic relationship on an even keel, even in times of tension.
We also encourage China’s active participation in the Major Economies Meeting efforts to develop a post-2012 framework for greenhouse-gas reduction.
As globalization advances and economies become more tightly integrated, worries about the effects of foreign competition – through trade or through foreign investment – have fueled economic nationalism and protectionist sentiments.
Foreign participation in the financial sector brings expertise needed to provide more efficient savings instruments, risk management, and allocation of capital.
The SED is one valuable tool in combating protectionist sentiments.
The arrest of these well-educated professionals, together with the Egyptian doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri’s role as al-Qaeda’s deputy leader, raises questions that go far beyond disaffection among Muslims and the consequences of America’s misadventures in the Middle East.
This phenomenon is not unique to Islam.
With their important role in modernization, applied scientists engage in cultural debates as well.
Professionals have been integral parts of such movements, because modernization encourages action rather than resignation.
Increasingly Islamism is becoming a form of right-wing populism.
Dulu’s story is heartbreaking – and heartbreakingly common – in the developing world: three billion people survive on diets that lack micronutrients like vitamin A and Zinc, and are at increased risk of illness from common infections like diarrheal disease, which kills nearly two million children annually.
Guided by their consideration of each option’s costs and benefits, and setting aside matters like media attention, the experts identified the best investments – those for which relatively tiny amounts of money could generate significant returns in terms of health, prosperity, and community advantages.
Should we contribute to organizations that focus on saving lives today, immediately making the world a better place (with spin-offs lasting longer), or fund education to benefit future generations?
Overall, we can typically best help through direct interventions, including micronutrient supplements, fortification, biofortification, and nutritional promotion.
In most countries, if a bank in which I place my money goes bust, the government, not the bank, compensates me.
Under the Obama-Volcker proposals, commercial banks would be forbidden to engage in proprietary trading – trading on their own account – and from owning hedge funds and private-equity firms.
The classic case is Britain’s Royal Bank of Scotland, which is not an investment bank.
Such proposed solutions assume that regulators will be able to identify excess risks, prevent banks from manipulating the regulations, resist political pressure to leave the banks alone, and impose controversial corrective measures “that will be too complicated to defend in public.”
As this clean-up from the Great Recession continues, one thing is clear: the source of global demand in the future will be the billions of consumers in Africa, China, and India.  But it will take time to activate that demand, for what is now being produced around the world for industrial-country consumers cannot simply be shipped to emerging-market consumers, especially the poorer ones among them.
This would allow the use of a less power-hungry fan instead of a compressor, and the fan could run on batteries rather than relying on the power grid.
Clearly, the Fed’s objective is to increase bond prices, in the hope that lower long-term interest rates will propel corporate investment.
They are resisting appreciation through foreign-exchange intervention and capital controls.
But this global focus on Sudan’s Darfur region, though justified, has overshadowed an even more vital issue: sustaining the quest for a broader peace in all of Sudan.
Nor should the international neglect that has for too long allowed the Darfur genocide to go unpunished recur when it comes to sustaining the quest for peace in Sudan.
More recently, leading American congressmen have been impressing on President Barack Obama the need for a muscular effort to implement the CPA.
International law and the indictment of war criminals are important for a civilized world order, but they are no substitute for active financial and political engagement to support an internationally legitimate, and urgently needed, peace accord such as the CPA in Sudan.
The annual number of housing starts has fallen by 1.2 million units, cutting annual GDP by an additional $250 billion.
As demand falls, businesses will reduce production, leading to lower employment and incomes, which in turn will lead to further cuts in consumer spending.
So it is not clear what will occur to reverse the decline in GDP and end the economic downturn. Will a sharp dollar depreciation cause exports to rise and imports to fall?
Choi also declared that even if the irregularities alleged by Gbagbo were confirmed, Ouattara still would have won enough votes to carry the election.
Indeed, in recent years an unfortunate trend has emerged in African politics: losing candidates, unhappy with their election results, unleash violence until the only option for mediators is to grant them a continued role in government.
It is vital that Africa and the international community take a stand against such strategies – not only to defend the votes of Ivorians, but as a signal to others in the future that legitimate electoral results must be respected.
Of course, the “World War” reference may be intended to create an “us” versus “them” logic, but this does not correspond to the nature of the challenge posed by radical Islam, given the complexity and the many divisions that exist within the Muslim world.
But that does not mean that we must become literally obsessed with terrorism at the expense of losing sight of broader historical challenges.
In other words, we are faced with the challenge of complexity, which requires us to ensure that a small minority is not joined by greater forces.
Likewise, while Japan has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio among rich countries, this is not a serious problem because the debt is domestically held.
Others point out that the US Fed’s “quantitative easing” efforts have been modestly successful, at best.
Recent inflation in many countries has been the result of higher commodity prices, especially fuel and food prices.
Growing income inequality in most countries before the Great Recession only made matters worse, by reducing household savings and increasing credit for consumption and asset purchases, rather than augmenting investment in new economic capacity.
But former US Federal Reserv e Chairman Alan Greenspan warns of inflationary dangers.
But monetary policy had little to do with it.
But what about the vast quantitative easing (printing of money) that has been occurring? Since the start of the crisis, the Bank of England has pumped $325 billion into the British economy, the Fed has expanded the US monetary base by close to $1 trillion, and the People’s Bank of China originated a record amount of $1.4 trillion in loans.
Flooding banks with central-bank money is no guarantee that deposits, which arise from spending or borrowing money, will increase in the same proportion.
But this should be a warning signal: to say that with unemployment now much higher, inflation is expected to remain low is really to say that there will be little recovery over the next five years.
Otherwise, their economies risk remaining stuck in recession.
This distortion is perceived to be one of the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis.
If we assume that a causal relationship exists, the European directive seems to be fairly well designed, with one main shortcoming.
In large financial institutions, however, the incentive to gamble at taxpayers’ expense does not apply only to managers; it extends to bondholders, who are de facto protected by the government.
But when it comes to immigration, there is not much in the liberal tradition to which they can turn.
From the perspective of Kantian cosmopolitanism, the least an American can do is to welcome a certain amount of immigration from Africa.
Instead, through a carefully chosen example, Straw was illustrating what it means to be open to others while expecting openness in return.
But a liberal society will allow people in and make exceptions for conditions under which they must be kept out, rather than keeping people out and making exceptions for when they should be allowed in. A liberal society will also view the world as teeming with potential that, however threatening to ways of life that are taken for granted, forces people to adapt to new challenges rather than trying to protect themselves against the foreign and unknown.
That seems unlikely.
But I see a practical turn in all this that no one has yet broached.
We have all seen Putin’s face age dramatically over the last eight years.
The New York Post, a tabloid, emitted a stream of sensational reportage claiming that 12 people had been killed and that a Saudi national was “under guard” at a Boston hospital.
American flags flew at half-mast; President Barack Obama addressed the nation; the country mourned with the families of the victims and with the young athletes who will never run again.
But America has also grown up in another way, learning to choose transparency over secrecy, and to rely on the power of its citizens.
ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN – Today’s International Monetary Fund (and, to a lesser degree, the World Bank) recall Talleyrand’s description of France’s Bourbon kings: it has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.
Indeed, the IMF’s outstanding general resource account (GRA) credits to middle-income developing countries fell by an unprecedented 91% from 2002 to 2007, as richer developing countries gained access to sources of financing that were free of the Fund’s conditionality.
Only when conditions in the country deteriorated even more in the wake of the Fund holding back on the second tranche of its loan did the IMF agree to loosen its conditions.  However in Latvia, the IMF has continued to demand austerity even in the wake of plummeting growth and rising unemployment which have lead to riots and political instability.
The Bourgeois Roots of Tunisia’s Revolution
The first president, Habib Bourguiba, was the leader of the liberation movement, which emerged victorious much more quickly – and much less violently – than its counterpart in Algeria.
The aim was to suppress any and all forms of democratic opposition.
For a brief moment, there was hope for a national-unity government, in which Ben Ali’s rump cabinet and the opposition would unite to prepare a presidential election.
The disaster, however, poses a much deeper challenge to how modern societies deal with regulating complex technologies.
And, as is often the case, a crisis in one country may go global, with many other countries radically scaling back off-shore and out-of-bounds projects.
Financial crises are almost comforting by comparison.
Until these problems are better understood, we may be doomed to a world of regulation that perpetually overshoots or undershoots its goals.
The four countries have very different economic structures: Russia and Brazil rely on commodities, India on services, and China on manufacturing.
This approach represents a 1950’s view of economic development, which has long been superseded by a more variegated perspective that recognizes a multiplicity of constraints – everything from poor governance to market failures – of varying importance in different countries.
Europe brought democratic values, social solidarity, and, for all its current problems, the century’s most impressive feat of institutional engineering, the European Union.
Crumbling BRICS
So far, the goal of “global realignment” away from the advanced countries has catalyzed these five very disparate countries’ efforts to forge their own bloc.
Is the bank supposed to serve as a counterweight to global multilateral development banks like the World Bank, or to reduce American and European dominance over the Bretton Woods institutions?
Other shared problems – such as corruption, poverty, and social underdevelopment – would be similarly difficult to address together.
NEW YORK – Whenever something bad happens – Iran moving closer to acquiring nuclear weapons, North Korea firing another missile, civilian deaths reaching another grim milestone in Syria’s civil war, satellites revealing an alarming rate of polar-ice melt – some official or observer will call upon the international community to act.
No amount of UN reform could make things fundamentally different.
The NPT allows countries the right to develop nuclear energy for purposes such as electricity generation, a loophole that allows governments to build most of what is necessary to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon.
There is no agreement on what, if anything, constitutes an appropriate target for espionage.
But so long as “international community” is more hope than reality, multilateralism will have to become more varied.
America's courts (like Italy's courts in the case of Parmalat) will make the final judgment over criminal and civil liability under existing law.
What's true for business bosses is doubly true for presidents and prime ministers.
Similarly, at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bush appointed in the person of Harvey Pitt a fox to guard the chickens - until public outrage forced Pitt's resignation.
But the intensity of opposition in America to Bush runs deeper than any single issue.
But the next worst thing is to assume that a minor patch-up will be enough to render globalization healthy and sustainable.
Moreover, the World Trade Organization’s agenda will remain irrelevant and, in any case, deadlocked.
The restructuring of economies away from finance will necessarily take some time.
Unfortunately, many of the solutions on offer are either too timid or demand too much of a global leadership that is in short supply.
Similarly, healthy and sustainable globalization should not impose a straitjacket of common rules on everyone.
Finally, as long as China provides political, financial, and military support for Burma’s rulers, it will be all but impossible for any meaningful change to occur.
So the stakes in Burma are high for China, as are Chinese fears of about how any future “national reconciliation” government might react to China’s record of complicity with the corrupt military rulers.
The international community must make clear that China’s interests would be protected during a transition to a more open society in Burma, and that some version of the oil pipeline project will be supported by any new regime.
While President Barack Obama has released a few prisoners, notably the Chinese Uighurs, and sent another for a real trial in New York City, he is now, chillingly, signalling that he is about to begin “preventive detention,” which would empower him to hold forever an unspecified number of prisoners without charges or trials.
But, six months after he ordered an end to torture and CIA “black sites,” and promised to close Guantánamo within a year, Obama seems to be re-branding Bush’s worst excesses. He has brought in planeloads of journalists to Guantánamo Bay to show them a “safe, transparent, and humane” facility that now offers fresh baklava and video viewing from a shackled loveseat.
In fact, even the explanation of why this material is classified cannot be reproduced, because it is privileged.
The “logical conclusion,” according to Dixon, is that Khan “must be detained for the rest of his life – regardless of whether he is ever charged with a crime – because if he was ever released, nothing would prevent him from disclosing this information.
In the years 1917 to 1919, US participation in World War I and anarchist bombings after the war led to almost two thousand federal prosecutions, mass roundups of aliens, and summary deportations. During World War II, Japan’s attack on the US was followed by the internment of more than 120,000 Japanese-Americans because of their race, including many who were born in the US.
One of the three counts against Nixon in the vote to impeach Nixon by the House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee was based on such eavesdropping.
At the same time, Bush has systematically packed the federal courts with judges chosen for their readiness to defer to presidential power.
In 1919, the first edition of Democratic Caesarism , by the Venezuelan historian and sociologist Laureano Vallenilla Lanz, was published and widely circulated across the continent.
With Latin America’s most recent democratic transition, which began in the 1980’s, national constitutions and electoral laws were gradually reformed and modernized.
In a recent interview with the British journalist David Frost, Nicaragua’s President Daniel Ortega, who returned to power in 2006, declared himself in favor of immediate re-election.
All of these tasks are domestic; the danger posed by the profusion of re-elected presidents will not be checked by external forces.
The state had America’s best public schools and state universities.
With 12% of America’s population, California accounts for more than 31% of its public-assistance recipients.
The political economy of California’s budget has taken the progressive tax-and-spend experiment to the breaking point, threatening the state’s ability to fund basic services, from prisons and parks to education and health care, even those aimed at helping its most vulnerable citizens.
Among US states, California still ranks first in technology, agriculture, and entertainment.
The Carry Trade Carries On
But not all investors are able to trade derivatives.
This was not without risk.
So products were developed that allowed investors to borrow easily in several currencies at once and invest in a portfolio of high-interest-rate currencies.
This has tended to increase metals prices, fueling Australia’s large export surplus in metals.
Had I been given enough space, I would have drawn this article!
As an editorial cartoonist, I always try to find more about my subjects before rendering my final sketches.
My answer is no. The issue is therefore not about the beliefs themselves as much as it is about how the faithful deal with offense, and why.
Whether caused by drought, exhausted soils, locusts, lack of high-yield seeds, the results were the same: desperation, disease, and death.
These impoverished villages need financial help to buy vital inputs for farming and to invest in basic infrastructure such as roads and electrification.
The cost of sending such help would be around $50 million, and the benefits would be $200 million to $300 million in increased food production next year (and hence less needed in emergency food aid).
Donors should lend their support by backing long-term solutions aimed at increasing food production, slowing population growth, and mitigating long-term global climate change.
It also seemed to violate earlier agreements to cooperate with other nations through the G-20, the Financial Stability Board, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
Regulation that is not globally coordinated, they warned, would create unnecessary uncertainty, prolong financial distress, and threaten economic recovery.
When financial regulations are devised by a coterie of global regulators in distant venues, it is bankers and technocrats who gain the upper hand.
Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann has gone so far as to warn that moving in this direction would “leave us all poor.”
Moreover, Kosovo’s demographic transformation over the last 100 years, when Albanians overtook the local Serb population, partly reflects an influx of Albanians from Albania – for decades a political and economic basket case, owing to Enver Hoxha’s hermetic communism.
Even in Europe, where Catalonia and the Basque region push for secession from Spain, some in Flanders want an end to Belgium, and Scotland’s ruling Scottish National Party wants eventually to break away from Britain, support for Kosovo’s independence is far from universal.
Not knowing where the enemy is hidden within the civilian population, security forces retaliate indiscriminately.
As previous experience has shown, internal discussions on constitutional competences – essentially political navel-gazing – can distract attention from the far more pressing issues of economic growth and jobs.
Their voices, however late in the day they have come, should be heeded.
The EU is much more than a set of rules governing the internal market and the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people.
CAMBRIDGE – Governments around the world are now developing massive fiscal stimulus packages that will cause unprecedented peacetime budget deficits.
Countercyclical fiscal policy had been largely discredited because of the delays involved in implementing fiscal changes and households’ weak response to temporary tax cuts.
So there is no alternative to fiscal policy if we want to reverse the current downturn.
Although I support the need for a large fiscal package, I disagree with many of the specific features of the plans now under consideration.
The Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change amounts to a call to action: it argues that huge future costs of global warming can be avoided by incurring relatively modest cost today.
Cost-benefit analysis is a principal tool for deciding whether altering it through mitigation policy is warranted.
Whereas the Stern Review follows a tradition among British economists and many philosophers against discounting for pure futurity, most economists take pure time preference as obvious.
Let’s assume that costs to prevent additional accumulation of CO2 (and equivalents) come to 1% of GNP every year forever, and, in accordance with a fair amount of empirical evidence, that the component of the discount rate attributable to the declining marginal utility of consumption is equal to twice the rate of growth of consumption.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s decision to proceed with plans to seek a vote this week on recognition of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly has come despite pressure, promises, and threats from Israel and some of its Western allies.
In fact, a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders is exactly what US President Barack Obama has called for.
Leaders of Abbas’s Fatah faction, which controls the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, and of Gaza-based Hamas have been meeting regularly to implement the Egyptian-Qatari reconciliation plan.
The Case for Re-Regulating Capital Accounts
(The same can be said of recent Japanese monetary-policy decisions.)
The effectiveness of monetary expansion could be enhanced in advanced countries by reducing the leakages generated by the carry trade and other short-term capital outflows.
A reserve requirement on cross-border flows is one of them.
Land, water, energy, and biodiversity all seem to be under greater stress than ever, and population growth appears to be a major source of that stress.
Poor farm families rely on their children for farm chores and for security when parents reach old age.
All of that growth will be in the developing world: 1.3 billion more people in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, the rest in Latin America and other regions.
But this concern can be met through increased saving by today's young and middle-aged as they prepare for retirement, and by working past the age of 65.
This explosive growth was made possible by huge advances in science and technology.
It should surprise no one that the Chechens, and other peoples of the Caucasus, do not feel very Russian.
After all, the tribute that the Kremlin pays Kadyrov and the corrupted elites of the other Caucasian republics has purchased palaces and gold pistols for men who are driving the region’s young, unemployed, and disadvantaged down the path of Islamic revolution.
He accused anonymous enemies (his anonymous “they” presumably included Western governments) of pursuing an agenda to destroy Russia, and he encouraged his security officials to push back.
Not coincidentally, the ten-year gap between summits overlaps with Russia’s re-emergence as a global player, following the trauma of the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Perhaps for this reason, there has been talk of a meeting in Astana between the presidents of Russia and France, the US secretary of state, and the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
An acceptable blueprint might emerge from high-level negotiations in Astana if it were to build on what succeeded in breaking previous negotiating deadlocks: the idea of a referendum in which the war-weary Karabakhis can determine their final status.
With interethnic tensions already on the rise, Yugoslavia was the first country to dissolve into conflict.
Everyone is afraid of China, which remains relatively peaceable, but no longer bothers to conceal its growing military capacity. With no pan-Asian security architecture expected to emerge in the near future, the West’s departure from the region is generating a security vacuum.
The first unfreezing had serious consequences. Now, global leaders must work to minimize the fallout of the second, and use all available means to prevent a third.
Their success lifted a significant share of poor Brazilians into the middle class and made Brazil an attractive destination for foreign investors.
Meanwhile, for Brazil’s new middle class, higher incomes have meant higher tax payments – and thus a growing sense of entitlement to improvements in living standards.
Meanwhile, the existing rail system is so precarious that it is impossible to travel by train from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo or Belo Horizonte or Brasília.
CAMBRIDGE – There is now intense debate about how the pay levels of top executives compare with the compensation given to rank-and-file employees.
Moreover, firms with a high CEO pay slice are associated with lower profitability.
Lower sensitivity of turnover to performance reflects less willingness on the part of directors to discipline the CEO.
Investors and corporate boards would thus do well to pay close attention not only to the compensation captured by the firms’ top executives, but also to how this compensation is divided among them.
Poverty has grown since Chávez took office in 1998; government finances and the trade balance are more dependent on oil revenues than before, and, aside from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood “barefoot doctor” services, the overall welfare of the poor remains the same, if not worse.
Chávez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba, and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner’s political fortunes.
To be sure, many Latin American leaders have tried to assuage and control Chávez, and they have all failed.
But the Balakotis are taking it in their stride – nose masks are everywhere.
Temporarily birds of peace instead of war, they do immensely more to calm angry Islamists than the reams of glossy propaganda put out by the US information services in Pakistan.
Hundreds of destroyed communities are scattered deep in the mountains. We saw helicopters attempt aerial drops; landing is impossible in most places.
For me personally, there is a sense of deja vu.
According to The Economist, six of the ten fastest-growing countries in 2011 were in Africa.
In fact, foreign direct investment in Africa has been on the rise since the early 2000’s, increasing fivefold in 2000-2010.
African SMEs also point the way to dynamic, sustainable, and fair growth.
This supports the view that investments in SMEs take as much – if not more – time to return a profit than less risky investments with a wider scope.
As a result, roughly 15% of sub-Saharan African trade is intra-regional, up from only 7% in 1990.
To rein in rising house prices and pre-empt the inflationary impact of the strongly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies implemented during the global financial crisis, China’s monetary authorities began to tighten financial conditions in January 2010.
First, as China ages rapidly, the disappearance of its demographic dividend will lower potential growth significantly. Moreover, other things being equal, the extremely rapid rise in fixed-asset investment has eroded China’s investment efficiency and capital efficiency, reducing potential output growth further.
Indeed, with an increasingly lenient political regime, populism may become irresistible, while the size of the government bureaucracy may continue to bloat.
The Clinton administration had called for bold action as far back as 1993, proposing what was in effect a tax on carbon emissions; but an alliance of polluters, led by the coal, oil, and auto industries beat back this initiative.
What is required, first and foremost, are market-based incentives to induce Americans to use less energy and to produce more energy in ways that emit less carbon.
A striking fact about climate change is that there is little overlap between the countries that are most vulnerable to its effects – mainly poor countries in the South that can ill afford to deal with the consequences – and the countries, like the US, that are the largest polluters.
The time to act is now.
Even though the embargo was aimed at the US and the Netherlands, market forces shifted oil among consumers, and in the long term all consuming countries suffered shortages of supply and the same price shock.
The US imports only a small portion of its oil from the Persian Gulf.
Many of these state-owned companies in countries like Russia and Venezuela are not responding merely to market forces, but are using their newfound pricing power for political purposes.
This year, China will surpass the US in emissions of greenhouse gases.
In their wake, a notable shift has emerged, with a new generation of politicians claiming to herald a fresh approach and profound changes in French policy towards Africa.
Whatever is decided about Zimbabwe’s participation at the Cannes summit will also have an impact on plans for a major EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon this fall, during Portugal’s presidency of the EU. During the last Portuguese Presidency (January-June 2000), the EU-Africa Summit had to be cancelled because of a visa ban on Zimbabwean officials and the reluctance of Africans to attend if Mugabe was excluded.
Whatever happens regarding Zimbabwe in Cannes will directly influence the EU-Africa summit later this year. Unfortunately, that controversy may also overshadow the incipient changes in French policy.
Its impressive military strength is of limited use as an instrument of power, and its political clout has been overestimated, particularly in Syria.
Meanwhile, Syria’s civil war highlights the loss of that country’s once-considerable influence in the region.
Iraq’s Kurds may even be able to extend their influence into Kurdish-populated northern Syria, thereby becoming a more influential regional player than the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
Nevertheless, though Saudi Arabia’s soft power is waning, its massive oil wealth will likely ensure that it remains a regional heavyweight.
MADRID – The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that was reached in 2005 between mostly Christian southern Sudan and the country’s Muslim North, ended one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern times.
The 2.5 million Southern Sudanese known to live in the North are under explicit instructions by the South’s Sudan People’s Liberation Army to boycott the referendum, as the SPLA has grounds to believe that Bashir would use their registration to rig the results in favor of unity.
Some Arab leaders still toy with the idea that overthrowing him might yet salvage a united Sudan, but it is probably too late for that.
But, to avoid a cataclysm, the US and its allies must defuse the bomb by enforcing the provisions of the 2005 CPA, which they all endorsed.
Critics of the scheme view it as symptomatic of big government run amok and ask why it is necessary for any government to feed schoolchildren.
Today, 87% of government schools implement the scheme.
The national government provides funds for cooks and helpers, and has devised guidelines for the program’s implementation, but schools are under the jurisdiction of state governments, some of which are more capable than others of maintaining the standards required to provide a reliable service.
It should be emulated by other developing countries, not shunned because of a preventable disaster.
Gas provides a tempting form of leverage, and Russia had already used it against Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Moldova.
But, charges of corruption aside, this outcome indicates that gas is not such an easy source of hard economic power as it would first appear.
That will not be easy.
The lesson from the Ukraine episode is that while Russia is less of a gas superpower than it would appear, Europe would be wise for to start building greater diversity into the energy relationship.
After all, should the dollar depreciate, China does not want to have too many eggs in the US basket.
Even though almost all of the oil produced by Unocal would have ended up on world markets rather than back in China, the US Congress’s skittishness assured that Unocal was sold to homegrown Chevron.
Indeed, it is still unclear where China’s amazing evolution will ultimately lead, so it would be naïve for American leaders to assume that China’s intentions will always be friendly and constructive, or that the two countries are inevitably destined to grow closer.
That is a strategy that will leave the US and the EU weaker, not stronger.
China regards the SCO as a stage for broadening its influence over a vast region, ranging from the Asia-Pacific to Southwest Asia, the Middle East, East Africa, and the Indian Ocean.
Moreover, it continues to build its “ string of pearls” of military bases at every key point on maritime transportation routes along the “arc of instability” from the Middle East to China’s coast.
And China has publicly stated that it will back African nations in potential disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international organizations.
When the two countries upgraded their alliance relationship in 1996, Japan’s military operational sphere was expanded far from the Japanese main island.
Last year, Japan issued a visa to Taiwan’s former president, Lee Teng-hui, a man who explicitly advocates a US-Japan-Taiwan alliance against China.
So, barely two months into the second Bush administration, alarm bells about the China threat seem to be ringing again.
Moreover, the failure of developed countries – particularly, the US – to take responsibility for their historical emissions of greenhouse gases continues, representing a major sticking point because these emissions far surpass those of the developing world.
Both sides agree that their roles are critical.
It did sign the Kyoto agreement, albeit as an “Annex I state,” meaning that it did not commit to any defined limits on carbon emissions.
As a developing country that has throughout history emitted only one-fifth of the CO2 emitted by the US, China insists that it has the moral right to resist calls to take the lead.
Whether or not the housing correction will hit overall growth depends on how one defines “hit.”
But the central government must be responsible for inflation in times of overheating, lest a bursting bubble fuel unemployment.
So they invest and speculate fiercely without much consideration of risk.
But it seems that what they have been doing in practice happened to be better than what their counterparts in some other countries were doing – a lot on “de-regulation,” but too little on cooling things down when the economy was booming and bubbles were forming.
Further geo-political implications for the region and the world follow from three key changes in China.
And, when measured in terms of purchasing power parity, China’s GDP will reach that of the US around 2015, thus changing the world’s balance of economic power.
In Japan, postal services that had been privatized are to be re-nationalized, and the role of government finance is being strengthened.
The Chinese Road to Pyongyang
But, although North Korea’s latest economic travails have shaken the leadership, the regime has weathered worse. And the economic relationship between China and North Korea is driven as much by material interests and economic factors as it is by concerns over geopolitical stability.
The final misconception is that Hu might have demanded an explanation from Kim as to the causes of the fatal sinking of a South Korean vessel in late March.
COPENHAGEN – There is a dangerous misperception that willpower and political agreement are the only missing ingredients needed to combat global warming.
Use of fossil fuels – though much maligned by some – remains absolutely vital for economic development, prosperity, and our very survival.
The report concludes bluntly, “No Danish wind industry to speak of would exist if it had to compete on market terms.”
That is ten times more than is spent by governments now, but remains a fraction of the cost of the ineffective carbon cuts that have been proposed.
The science is clear, manmade changes in climate are being felt, and the electorate’s demand for action is growing. Though unlikely just a few months ago, a strong global agreement by 2010, one that will set a path for action for decades to come, now stands a good chance of being implemented.
This year, the IPCC is releasing its fourth round of reports, starting with the one issued early in February.
By the end of 2007, all of the world’s governments should begin negotiations on a climate-change system for the years after 2012, when the current Kyoto Protocol expires.
The Earth Institute at Columbia University, which I direct, hosted a Global Roundtable of leading businesses, environmental groups, and other international organizations to reach a consensus to help inform the upcoming negotiations. The Roundtable produced an important Statement of Principles and a longer overall statement that has been signed by many of the world’s largest businesses, including those based in the US, Europe, Canada, China, and India.
That anecdote has parallels with the current preoccupation with global warming.
Rich people rarely contract malaria or die from it; poor people do.
In Haiti, which lacks such policies, 2,000 died.
For one-fiftieth of that cost, we could provide essential micronutrients to 2-3 billion people, thereby preventing perhaps a million deaths and making half the world’s population mentally and physically much stronger.
For instance, changes are taking place in precipitation patterns, with a trend toward higher precipitation levels in the world’s upper latitudes and lower precipitation in some sub-tropical and tropical regions, as well as in the Mediterranean area.
Overall, temperature increases are projected to increase by the year 2100 within a range of 1.1 to 6.4˚C. In order to focus on this set of outcomes, the IPCC has come up with a best estimate at the lower end of this range of 1.8˚C, and 4˚C at the upper end.
Moreover, there are enormous co-benefits to mitigation: lower emissions of GHGs would be accompanied by lower air pollution and increased energy security, agricultural output, and employment. If these co-benefits were taken fully into account, that price tag of 3% of GDP in 2030 would be substantially lower, perhaps even negative.
Emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere and is a major cause of rising temperatures, is a byproduct of a wide range of normal economic activities.
But such external shocks may also have indirect effects by aggravating the disparities between developed and developing countries and creating additional incentives for mass migration to rich, less affected, and more adaptable regions.
The so-called emissions trading system aims to control carbon emissions by allocating tradable permits.
Given that the bombs, bullets, and embargos of traditional security policy are irrelevant, what can the US and other rich countries do about this security threat? 
If the US turned inward and seriously curtailed immigration, there would be serious consequences for America’s position in the world.
Both the numbers and origins of the new immigrants have caused concerns about immigration’s effects on American culture.
The Census Bureau projects that the American population will grow 49% over the next four decades.
In addition, the presence of multiple cultures creates avenues of connection with other countries, and helps create an important broadening of American attitudes in an era of globalization.
Enlightened Japanese elites are fascinated by Franco-German reconciliation.
Moreover, Europeans should, in the same spirit of openness, ask themselves what they can learn from Asia.
Many Chinese may dream of spending like Europeans, but the nightmare of most Europeans nowadays is that they might have to start working as hard as the Chinese.
Moreover, Europe’s ability to exert pressure on China is extremely limited at best, and may be least potent where Chinese domestic matters are concerned.
The main result of monetary stimulus has been to boost asset prices: anything that pays a yield, a dividend, or a rent becomes much more attractive - and hence much more valuable in money terms - when interest rates are very low and expected to stay very low.
The dominant mode of thought within the Federal Reserve - with which I agree - appears to be that the information-technology revolution is continuing, that the pace of growth of potential output in the US remains very fast, and that the output gap is thus relatively wide.
This is a crucial question for policy makers, because those who bought long-term assets due to what seemed like perpetually rising prices are also those who will sell as soon as price trends seem to be reversing.
The report was drawn up by experts from almost all OAS member states, and was divided into two parts: an excellent analytical section, and a brief and somewhat exasperating chapter devoted to future scenarios.
The third “marijuana moment” stems from recent decisions in New York and Illinois – the third and fifth most populous US states, respectively – to proceed with legalizing medical marijuana.
International conventions still limit governments’ leeway, and the US government remains opposed to any backtracking from the punitive, prohibitionist strategy that it has pursued since 1981.
In 1999, The Economist labeled Germany “the sick man of the euro” – a monument of European sclerosis, with low growth and high unemployment.
One of his first decisions was to peg the Danish krone to the Deutschmark to stop the inflation-devaluation cycle.
The Social Democrats returned to power in 1994, but they accepted Bildt’s new fiscal policies, and even carried out a revolutionary pension reform in 1998 that properly tied benefits to payments.
Since 1992, it has maintained a more or less balanced budget, with hardly any public debt.
Third, reforms require a strong leader.
The Soviet Union’s collapse, it should be remembered, was not the result of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s reformist “betrayal.”
The third stage extends the myth through heroic triumph.
The coming transition will be markedly different from the 1999 transfer of power.
They now argue that Putin personally chose repression in responding to the protest movement that filled the streets of Moscow and other major cities in late 2011 and early 2012.
As his opponents have hardened their stance, Russia has become ripe for a peaceful anti-criminal revolution.
The supply stand-off between Russia and Ukraine of 2009 made these worries crystal clear in Europe, where gas imports are set to rise to 86% of demand by 2030, from 57% in 2006.
The energy sector has a relatively slow rate of capital replacement because of the long lifetimes of much of its infrastructure.
To do so would mean a technology shift that – in terms of scale and speed of deployment – is unprecedented.
But clear price signals are not enough, as a low-carbon future requires major breakthroughs in technology development and deployment.
Some conservatives disliked the crude egalitarianism of American culture, while some on the left saw America’s faith in markets as a symbol of capitalist exploitation of the working class.
According to Sarkozy, “The virulence of the press and a portion of French elites against the United States reflects a certain envy of your brilliant success.”
But one should not read too much into these differences.
FLORENCE – US President Barack Obama’s administration has lost little time in announcing that it will seek direct talks with the Iranian government.
Yet each of the region’s states has important security concerns and vulnerabilities.
This is true, but it is an insufficient explanation.
Under ideal diplomatic circumstances, Russia and China would be persuaded to join with NATO in a joint declaration.
Deflecting mounting criticism, Bush rejects appeals to boycott the summit.
Russia has stabilized under Putin, but its has become markedly less democratic.
But there need to be limits to the West’s tolerance, particularly given the summit’s agenda, which features energy security, fighting disease, promoting education, counter-terrorism, and non-proliferation.
On terrorism, Russia was the first country to host an official Hamas delegation after the Palestinian elections, and it continues to crush Chechen terror and resistance with methods that would bring it to an international court, were it not a Security Council member.
Chancellor Angela Merkel is celebrating a landslide victory, with her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) having fallen just short of an outright parliamentary majority.
Merkel’s predecessor, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Gerhard Schröder, knew this well.
So Germany will be left with a grand coalition – just as the German electorate wanted.
Her positions on these issues have now been endorsed by a huge portion of the German electorate; and, from a certain age, most people – including those in high office – do not change easily.
The Human Stew
But new evidence suggests that modern humans evolved relatively recently in Africa – and that the transformation that they underwent after their departure some 60,000 years ago was far from seamless.
As a result, many people’s genomes contain roughly 1% Neanderthal DNA.
In this case, the source may have been as-yet-unknown remnants of the ancient species Homo heidelbergensis – a direct ancestor of both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis – surviving somewhere in southern Africa.
The overwhelming consensus in the policy community is that if only the government had bailed out Lehman, the whole thing would have been a hiccup and not a heart attack.&nbsp; Famous investors and leading policymakers alike have opined that in our ultra-interconnected global economy, a big financial institution like Lehman can never be allowed to fail.
The system had reached a point where it had to be bailed out and restructured.&nbsp; And there is no realistic political or legal scenario where such a bailout could have been executed without some blood on the streets.&nbsp; Hence, the fall of a large bank or investment bank was inevitable as a catalyst to action.
Asia may be willing to sponsor the west for now, but not in perpetuity.&nbsp; Eventually Asia will find alternatives in part by deepening its own debt markets.&nbsp; Within a few years, western governments will have to sharply raise taxes, inflate, partially default, or some combination of all three.&nbsp; As painful as it may seem, it would be far better to start bringing fundamentals in line now.&nbsp; Restoring confidence has been helpful and important.
Consider, for example, America in Iraq.
Daily violence should not be allowed to hide deeper strategic realities: victory was around the corner, and soon, the world – despite all the anti-Bush propaganda – would recognize it.
Of course, confidence and self-doubt are not mutually exclusive.
Only the self-correcting mechanisms of truly democratic regimes can ensure the right balance.
In mid-July 2011, Greece’s sovereign debt stood at €350 billion (160% of GDP).
It was write-offs and devaluations, not austerity programs, that allowed bond prices to recover.
But, until 1980, Germany continued repaying the loans that it had incurred to pay the reparations.
This raises the question of justice, but not the economic consequences of insisting on payment.
But other countries – including neighboring Asian economies – fear that Japan is devaluing the yen to bolster exports and growth at their expense.
The collapse of asset bubbles in the 1990’s left Japan’s financial system and private sector saddled with a huge debt overhang.
The danger of a currency war and protectionism should not be underestimated.
East Asian economies could then, over time, cooperate to enhance regional exchange-rate stability, thereby creating a more conducive environment for intra-regional trade.
As a Korean, I am always puzzled by Korean extremism. Where in the world can you find a more isolated, regimented and militarized dynastic mutation of a communist totalitarian system than in North Korea?
“Economic strangulation” of North Korea appears to be the fallback option.
After tough and effective UN-led sanctions are imposed, the concerned parties must wait until North Korea feels the pain of the economic squeeze.
That failure led directly to the colonization of Korea by Japan.
Russia and Iran have kept the Syrian government supplied with heavy weapons and other military assistance, including a Russian shipment of sophisticated anti-ship missiles with advanced radar systems.
Part of Syria’s agony is the self-fulfilling nature of the conflict.
In a recent conversation about Syria with a couple of well-known foreign policy experts, one participant suggested that the Middle East’s current borders, drawn in colonial times, cannot last and must be redrawn.
But if the lessons of the past two years are any guide, the wheels of violence will keep on turning.
But enlargement fatigue among the member states continues to muddy this optimistic forecast.
But that has changed fundamentally.
Indeed, unlike in previous accession rounds, the EU has provided no concrete timetable for achieving the promise of membership made in Thessaloniki ten years ago.
It is to be ratified by national parliaments, in some cases through referenda, and it can be amended only by further Inter-Governmental Conferences, not by the European Parliament, let alone by the (non-existent) "people of Europe."
This is why it has the curious quality that sometimes you see it and sometimes you don't.
All this suggests conclusions that give pause for thought.
There are major unresolved issues in the "near-abroad" of the enlarged Union, in Eastern Europe, and in the Balkans.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, the French Emperor Napoleon III actually created a Latin Monetary Union, which included Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland.
Voting budgets in parliament – a representative institution – ensured that the people as a whole were liable for the obligations incurred by their government. They would thus have a powerful incentive to impose controls on spending to insure that their claims could be met.
But there was an immediate problem: the existing tax system had reached its limits, and no more revenue could be raised without ending time-honored privileges and immunities.
John Kerry’s Tricky Bid
But, with the security situation in the “occupied territories” under control, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s government is content with the status quo.
By revisiting the Israeli offer, Kerry could neatly combine economic stimulus with fulfillment of a key Palestinian demand.
“How do we resolve the contradiction between our extreme morality and our blatantly immoral circumstances?” asks the writer Uri Avnery.
After all, ordinary soldiers take this risk, so why should political leaders – who can do much greater good or ill – be immune to it?
Syria’s Hijacked Struggle
Jihadi fighters connected to Al Qaeda are now in the majority.
Salim Idris, the council’s chief of staff, has expressed a willingness to fight alongside extremist groups that refuse to accept the unified command.
They disregard the warnings of people like Alain Chouet, the former chief officer of the French General Directorate for External Security in Damascus, who recently denounced France’s provision of weapons to the rebels as “completely illegal” and described how “the jihadi militias have taken precedence over the others.”
Some leaders may be starting to recognize the need for a new narrative.
When they arrived, brown domes made of crisscrossed branches and layers of multicolored mats would appear like crowds of dappled beetles on the outskirts of town.
Today, there are some 50 million nomadic herders in Sub-Saharan Africa, and as many as 150 million agro-pastoralists, who combine traditional nomadic animal-rearing with some form of agriculture.
In order to enhance their livelihoods’ stability and profitability further, pastoralists need to be integrated into the formal economy.
Cooperative movements took shape in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Japan in the 1800’s.
Of course, cooperatives have sometimes struggled to live up to the ideal.
Some of the most notable programs include the Indian Dairy Cooperative, which has created an estimated 250,000 jobs, mostly in rural areas.
COPENHAGEN – A sense of panic is setting in among many campaigners for drastic cuts in global carbon emissions.
In Kyoto, leaders committed to a cut of 5.2% below 1990 levels by 2010.
This finding was based on a groundbreaking research paper that showed that even a highly efficient global CO2 tax aimed at fulfilling the ambitious goal of keeping temperature increases below 2oC would reduce annual world GDP by a staggering 12.9%, or $40 trillion, in 2100.
If politicians change course and agree this December to invest significantly more in research and development, we would have a much greater chance of getting this technology to the level where it needs to be.
In a world of mobile capital, corporate-tax rates matter, and business decisions about how and where to invest are increasingly sensitive to national differences.
It would also reduce numerous efficiency-reducing distortions in the US tax code, including substantial tax advantages for debt financing over equity financing and for non-corporate businesses over corporate businesses.
Eliminating accelerated depreciation for equipment would raise the effective tax rate on new investments; repealing the domestic-production deduction would increase the effective tax rate on US manufacturing; and rescinding the R&amp;D tax credit would reduce investment in innovation.
An increase in the corporate-tax rate appeals to many US voters who believe that corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes and are worried about widening income inequality.
The US government is thus essentially being paid in real terms to take investors’ money – a generous offer that it is accepting on a huge scale, in the hope that channeling these resources to American consumers will boost household spending and thus generate more jobs.
So why is the US now singing a different tune? The answer is obvious: America’s high unemployment rate, which hovers between 9% and 10%.
Such a move is likely to be effective, given the sheer size of Chinese interventions (hundreds of billions of US dollars annually), which could not easily be recycled through offshore banks without exposing the China’s central bank to many other risks.
Count to ten before you respond.
The good news about the Bush project, so far title-free, is that it is apparently going to be different from the usual reputation polishing.
This is where Cheney came in.
Cheney’s influence resulted in the bloody disaster of Iraq, the moral humiliation of Guantanamo, water-boarding and “extraordinary rendition,” the despair of friends and the contempt of critics, a full-dress parade of double standards around the globe.
NEW YORK – China’s successful transformation from a middle-income country to a modern, high-income country will depend largely on the reforms that the government undertakes over the next decade.
Developing-country central banks keep interest rates artificially low to ensure sufficient low-cost financing for the public sector, while avoiding large fiscal deficits and high inflation.
SMEs and households with net savings stand to gain the most from interest-rate liberalization.
Gradual implementation would enable the losers to adjust their behavior before it is too late, while sustaining momentum on pivotal reforms, which should be policymakers’ top priority.
Cameron, of course, faced a difficult task with his party, which required a statement from him of his European policy.
Already some are claiming to discern in his European policy the makings of an heir to Harold Wilson, another famous “renegotiator” of Britain’s terms of membership in the then-European Community who went on to win a referendum on Europe.
Given that this position reflects the British public’s attitude toward the EU, it is not surprising.
The net result is that it seems highly probable that any attempted achievement of a “new settlement,” including repatriation of competences, will make it much more difficult for Britain to remain in the EU than would be the case if a straightforward “in/out” referendum were held now.
Yet, despite the cost in human lives, anti-GM campaigners – from Greenpeace to Naomi Klein – have derided efforts to use golden rice to avoid vitamin A deficiency.
Both are great deals. But golden rice would cost just $100 for every life saved from vitamin A deficiency.
Foodstuffs like soy, wheat, milk, eggs, mollusks, crustaceans, fish, sesame, nuts, peanuts, and kiwi would likewise be banned, because they can cause food allergies.
Yes, the seeds are more expensive, but the rise in production offsets the additional cost.
The Obama of the Cairo speech of 2009, when he called for a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, has been increasingly eclipsed by Obama the terrorist-slayer, the commander-in-chief who has launched hundreds of drone strikes against Al Qaeda and its affiliates and who ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden.
That would mean bombing Damascus, which could harden Syrian support for Assad.
Consider the contrast with Libya, where one of the outcomes of US intervention was tens of thousands of Libyans marching in the streets with placards declaring their support of the US and their outrage and sorrow at the murder of the US ambassador.
The Cracks in the G-20
The premise is clear: as the crisis made more evident than ever, the interdependence of countries is inescapable.
Even respecting the idiosyncrasies of each context, there is still sufficient common ground for more precision in the agreements.
Lack of agreement on the United Nations Security Council resolution against Iran does not help coordination and cooperation within the G-20, either.
So there remains much to do.
Moreover, failed states are an incubator for terrorism, trafficking of drugs and people, piracy, and other illicit activities. Of the half that remains at peace, the large majority end up highly dependent on foreign aid – hardly a sustainable model in the context of the global financial crisis.
As a result, such policies should be discontinued as soon as possible.
The rest was allocated to the US Department of Defense as a supplement to its annual budget, which has been between $500 and $650 billion in recent years.
On July 13, 1931, the German banking system collapsed, ensuring that what was previously an American economic downturn became the worldwide Great Depression.
In each of these summer crises, addressing the technical issue was not enough to solve the problem.
A Europeanization of some part of value-added tax would be a tremendous advance in combating the massive fraud that the existing system nurtures.
Consider the European crises that produced good outcomes.
He realized that it was important to act early, with money that would be spent quickly, but that there was a risk that the crisis would not be over soon.
Deficit fetishism never makes sense –&#160;the national debt is only one side of a country’s balance sheet.
There is no reason that mining companies should reap this reward for themselves.
Rudd campaigned on a promise to reverse that stance, but the failure of the climate-change talks in Copenhagen last December, when President Barack Obama refused to make the kind of commitment on behalf of the United States that was required, left Rudd’s government in an awkward position.
The Crisis of Consumerism
Consumption or, more precisely, consumerism , appeared to be globalized.
But schemes such as public subsidies for scrapping old and fuel-inefficient cars simply led many people to re-schedule their purchases.
The Great Depression of the 1930’s was interpreted as the result of inadequate consumption, of poverty in the midst of plenty.
What will replace the age of consumerism? The most obvious answer is that the shift to a service economy – already well under way by the beginning of the new millennium – will become more complete.
This service economy may generate higher levels of overall well-being if it emphasizes that humans do not exist as separate islands, but existentially depend on their relations with others.
As sensible as this two-pronged approach – spend now, cut later – may be, it is made virtually impossible by the absence of any mechanism whereby President Barack Obama can credibly commit himself or future administrations to fiscal tightening.
But, once again, this requires a credible commitment to an exchange that requires a promise of action later in return for something now.
But certain fiscal decisions, and most critically the level of the fiscal deficit, can be delegated to an independent board.
But possibilities are shaped by our decisions as much as they are by our circumstances.
Aggressive agents were marketing the loans with no heed to borrowers’ capacity to repay.
The late Indian management guru C.K. Prahalad suggested in his bestselling book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid that businesses could make healthy profits by serving the poor – and so satisfy their shareholders while promoting social development.
Private institutions obviously cannot afford to do that.
One year after he was re-elected in a landslide, Thailand’s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been forced to dissolve the National Assembly and call a snap election.
In foreign affairs, Thaksin carved out his own space on the international stage with ambitious regional cooperation schemes anchored around the 25-member Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation (ACMECS) and a clutch of bilateral free-trade agreements with the major powers, including the US, China, Japan, India, and Australia.
Thaksin’s days appear numbered, for Thailand seems poised to eject a popularly elected prime minister.
Moreover, a royal intervention would risk returning Thailand to square one, seeking to rewrite its constitution to remedy the shortfalls of its democratic culture.
To public opinion, it looks as if arrogant financial-market professionals learned nothing from the crisis, feeding the impression that nothing has changed – except for the worse.
The G-20’s Washington program (signed by George W. Bush) was neither ambitious nor well structured.
The era when London vaunted its light-touch regulation is over.
Financial reform could still go belly up. But it is premature to write it off as a failure.
After 70 years of denial, Russia’s leadership (if not yet ordinary Russians) were ready to admit that Joseph Stalin’s NKVD (precursor to the KGB) slaughtered more than 20,000 Polish officers, intellectuals, and clergy in the nearby Katyn forest in 1940.
Throughout the interwar years, Poland and the nascent Soviet regime were at daggers drawn almost without interruption.
The Polish-born Pope John Paul II crystallized the anti-communist “threat” that Poland now posed to the Soviet Union.
For example, pre-modern Europe believed that a woman who had sex before marriage might carry the imprint of her lover within her, so that her child born in wedlock would resemble the earlier lover, rather than the husband.
But the emergence of molecular comparisons in the 1960’s, and DNA technologies in the 1980’s, presented a new way of comparing species.
We can gain some zoological perspective on what that number really means by comparing another species to apes and humans.
That is not to say it is inaccurate or false; just that its meaning is far less obvious than it may appear superficially. &nbsp;
In the future, Cameron declared, Muslim groups that do not, for example, endorse women’s rights, defend freedom of expression, or promote integration would lose all government funding.
The Stockholm suicide bombing was not the first act of violence linked to Vilks.
The Sweden Democrats (SD), a party with roots in the country’s white-supremacist movement, entered the parliament for the first time in September 2010, with the support of 5.7% of the Swedish electorate.
But China’s rulers permit discussion of the Cultural Revolution only within this official framework, suppressing any and all unofficial reflections.
The revolution’s veterans refuse to discuss their arrogant presumption of “natural Redness,” or to mention that they rebelled because they wanted power.
She complained that she was “too famous,” “too active,” and “too stressed” at the time, and she provided extensive details about how Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, persecuted the Ye family and how the Ye children went to prison.
As long as the Cultural Revolution remains unaccounted for, it will not have ended.
People in the Ukrainian town of Kherson are more entrepreneurial than people from Kiev.
Cultural variables seem to explain a lot: religion and politics accounted for about half of the variation across municipalities.
She interviewed people in both countries and asked them what it meant to be a “worthy person.” In essence, she was asking people about their sense of what is important in life and about their own personal sense of identity.
Virtually every country is a pastiche of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their personal identity.
For only the US – with all its power and sense of mission – had the ability to establish a new world order at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
This was not always and everywhere the case – certainly not in Latin America.
What is needed is a conscious, deliberate return of US foreign policy to multilateralism.
She was right then, and she is still right today.
FLORENCE – The nineteenth century was mesmerized by the cyclical behavior of business.
Keynesianism definitively ended in 1979, following the second oil-price shock of the decade.
The response to the economic crisis in Thailand and Korea in the late 1990’s was emphatic preaching about the inherent superiority of the so-called Anglo-Saxon economic model.
The European social-democratic model survived the 1970’s in a bedraggled form.
So there is no master currency at all any more.
But the rescue has fueled a growing rift that jeopardizes the future of European integration, partly owing to the way that the upheaval of the early twentieth century – especially the Great Depression – has been reenacted in the debates about the post-2008 financial meltdown and the subsequent euro crisis.
Events in Cyprus have exposed two other dimensions to the clashes over Europe’s dual sovereign-debt and banking crisis.
Even the Catholic Church seems to reflect the new mood: The election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio as Pope Francis is a clear reference to St. Francis of Assisi and the Church’s mission to stand up for the poor.
CANBERRA – North Korea’s latest nuclear test is bad news, both for Northeast Asia and for a world that needs to reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons.
Nor has North Korea’s behavior done anything to help the cause of global non-proliferation and disarmament.
For that message to resonate, the major nuclear-armed states must not only remain committed to non-proliferation, but also get serious about disarmament.
But they don’t bear all the blame for the past, and are not behaving completely irrationally.
Importantly, adverse effects are seen at very low intakes: for example, 1-3% of total energy, or approximately 2-7 grams (20-60 calories) for a person consuming 2000 calories/day.
4. Use of trans fats in food manufacturing and restaurants can be limited without any significant effects on food taste, cost, or availability. While industry often expresses concern that limiting the use of trans fats will affect food taste or cost, no evidence exists to support this hypothesis.
The formal name of the panel was “Silicon Envy: Will Europe ever build the next new media giant?”
All over the world, little boys study math and science in the hope of becoming the next Bill Gates.
But the two CEOs couldn’t agree on terms, and now the CTO’s company is dead while the other company struggles with inadequate technology.
The problem is not just a lack of engineers, but also of people with the necessary business, financial, and communication skills.
The Dangers of Deficit Reduction
Faster growth and returns on public investment yield higher tax revenues, and a 5 to 6% return is more than enough to offset temporary increases in the national debt.
Yet, even with large deficits, economic growth in the US and Europe is anemic, and forecasts of private-sector growth suggest that in the absence of continued government support, there is risk of continued stagnation – of growth too weak to return unemployment to normal levels anytime soon.
Principles like “it is better to tax bad things than good things” might suggest imposing environmental taxes.
For now, the economics is clear: reducing government spending is a risk not worth taking.
But debates about the role of nuclear weapons in the modern world, as well as in the future, are only beginning.
Nuclear deterrence – a threat to kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people – is a concept that does not fit into traditional morals.
Similarly, if the US withdraws its largely nominal tactical nuclear weapons from Europe, US-Europe strategic ties would weaken.
Arms-control talks are mostly needed for rendering national arsenals more transparent, and for building confidence between the great powers.
After two rounds of quantitative easing (QE), the balance sheets of the European Central Bank and the United States Federal Reserve have grown to €3.2 trillion ($4.1 trillion) and $2.9 trillion, respectively.
Given that the renminbi’s real and expected rates of return are higher than the real rate of return of other currencies, it has become a positive carry against foreign currencies, reinforcing the tendency to hold assets in renminbi and liabilities in foreign currencies.
These events are not distant memories.
Financial globalization meant that banks no longer held assets like mortgages on their books, but packaged them in asset-backed securities that were sold to investors in capital markets worldwide, thereby distributing risk more widely.
Finally, the investors who bought MBS’s and CDO’s were greedy and believed the misleading ratings.
Easier monetary policy may boost liquidity, but it will not resolve the solvency crisis.
Fourth, the role of rating agencies needs to be rethought, with more regulation and competition introduced.
For example, the countries that were consigned by Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin’s un-tender mercies are now mostly part of the European Union.
Many Chagossians eventually moved away from the Seychelles and Mauritius. Some settled in London (my European Parliament constituency).
But, when answering a parliamentary question that I put to the European Commission recently, the commissioner responsible for development policy, Andris Piebalgs, indicated that the Commission would consider any request from the UK for co-financing the Chagossians’ repatriation, which the EU fully and rightly accepts as a sovereign UK matter.
Unlike many other African states, Somalis had roughly the same linguistic and ethnic background.
Protestants replied that if a vote were held within the geographical area of the entire island, the two-thirds Catholic majority would rule.
In the Caucasus, Azerbeijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Abkhazians, and Chechens all demanded states on the basis of self-determination.
The best hope for the future is to ask what is being determined as well as who determines it.
Rajaratnam’s trial is remarkable in many ways.
Past insider-trading prosecutions of people other than occasional traders usually involved rogue financiers, like Ivan Boesky in the 1980’s.
Fortunately, this is not the case.
Investors are talking of “green shoots” of recovery and of positive “second derivatives of economic activity” (continuing economic contraction is the first, negative, derivative, but the slower rate suggests that the bottom is near).
It is said that the International Monetary Fund, which earlier this year revised upward its estimate of bank losses, from $1 trillion to $2.2 trillion, will announce a new estimate of $3.1 trillion for US assets and $0.9 trillion for foreign assets, figures very close to my own.
At some point, investors will realize that bank losses are massive, and that some banks are insolvent.
The Dear Leader Cleans House for the Young General
In particular, they have been monitoring the body count of senior North Korean officials who have suddenly retired, disappeared, or died in automobile accidents.
Indeed, China offered South Korea a veiled warning that it “should not sweat the small stuff,” implying that the unprovoked killing of 46 South Korean sailors is a petty matter, and certainly not one that will cause China to rethink its alliance with North Korea.
All this diplomatic activity is good news for everyone, everywhere. But neither the US-Russia agreement, nor the global nuclear arms talks, will have much impact on today’s most perilous threat: the nuclear honeymoon between an Iran determined to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity and a North Korea willing to sell Iran much of that capacity for hard currency.
Those seen as having failed to follow Party dictates in an appropriate way face severe recrimination.
This is how it works: the Second Economic Committee, which is under the command of the Party’s central leadership, manufactures missiles with the help of North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Sciences.
So desperate is North Korea’s financial position that, this past December, the Ministry of People’s Security suspended the domestic use of foreign currency. Violations are punishable by death.
One sensational if undocumented story has the Gulf States conspiring with China, Russia, Japan, and France – now there’s an odd coalition for you – to shift the pricing of oil away from dollars.
When the sub-prime crisis erupted in early September 2007, I published an article entitled “Why Now is a Good Time to Sell the Dollar” in a prominent financial publication.
Their intervention in recent weeks shows a reluctance to let this happen.
And, even then, the renminbi will presumably share the international stage with the dollar, not replace it.
Foreigners – and residents – might well grow disenchanted with the currency of an economy with these characteristics.
Although the French-speaking Belgians started the European Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, they are now living in a deprived rustbelt in need of federal subsidies, a substantial amount of which comes from taxes paid by the more prosperous, high-tech Flemish.
Belgian separatists like to observe that Belgium was never a natural nation-state, but an accident of history.
One reason why Flemish Belgians resent having to prop up the Walloons with their tax money is that they regard them almost as foreigners.
If Flemish citizens don’t want their taxes to go to the Walloons, what about helping out unemployed immigrants from Africa, a large chunk of which the Belgians once owned and exploited as a major source of their prosperity? It should come as no surprise that the Flemish nationalist party (Vlaams Belang) is hostile to immigrants too.
Without having intended it, the EU now seems to be encouraging the very forces that postwar European unity was designed to contain.
Even the conservative states of the Arabian Peninsula are embroiled in lively disputes about women ministers, Shia representation, Islamist participation in the political process, and even the future of their ruling monarchies.
Indeed, Prince Naif, the Minister of the Interior and leader of the hardliners, has either silenced or imprisoned hundreds of the key Saudi reformers.
All await a chance to rule.
Death, of course, comes to all living things.
But NATO’s repeated demonstrations of resilience should not blind us to the fact that it no longer provides a healthy basis for the transatlantic security relationship.
All the talk of an improved NATO-European Union partnership is mainly wasted breath.
The US mission to the EU should be scaled up, and EU representation in Washington turned into a proper embassy. The more seriously the Americans show that they are willing to take the EU collectively, the more seriously the Europeans will take themselves.
Will it survive the current maelstrom of challenges – exemplified by the recent assassination of Governor Salmaan Taseer of Punjab by one of his bodyguards, an Islamic zealot – or will it capsize? For the world, Pakistan’s fate is an urgent, perhaps even an existential, question.
This brings us to the heart of the matter: the question of Islam and statehood.
Indeed, the issue that now lies at Pakistan’s core is whether it can become a theocratic state.
In Pakistan, the extremist now wears Islamic garb, and stands for the Creator, for faith, and for a theocratic order.
He was a world-renowned philosopher, a professor at great universities – Oxford, Yale, Chicago – and someone who was respected and admired by his colleagues around the world.
But while Kolakowski “traveled” with the Communists and supported them for a few years, he was never really a “good comrade” because he never allowed himself to stop thinking for himself.
He was an icon among his fellow countrymen – indeed, for his 70th birthday, the largest newspaper in Poland organized a celebration during which they crowned him (with a crown of laurel leaves, of course) … the King of Europe.
It was an implicit wish for a spectacular form of suicide, for a spectacularly prosaic reason: the loss, experienced by thousands of Russian women of her generation, of her life’s existential foundation.
Along with its restraints on liberty and its dramatic increase in the power of the Kremlin bureaucracy, Putin has overseen the rise of a Russian middle class that has become increasingly similar to Western middle classes.
But for Tereshkova and other women of her generation, the great Soviet state and the daring achievements of Soviet science were inseparable.
Although economic globalization has enabled unprecedented levels of prosperity in advanced countries and has been a boon to hundreds of millions of poor workers in China and elsewhere in Asia, it rests on shaky pillars. Unlike national markets, which tend to be supported by domestic regulatory and political institutions, global markets are only “weakly embedded.”
Meanwhile, they regarded themselves as the true progressives, because they understood that safeguarding and advancing globalization was the best remedy against poverty and insecurity.   
What they want is not to turn back globalization, but to create new institutions and compensation mechanisms – at home or internationally – that will render globalization more effective, fairer, and more sustainable.
The world economy desperately awaits its new Keynes.
Money ceases to have credibility. Leaders become figures of contempt or worse.
Its fraudulent accounts were certified by Arthur Andersen.
Rubin, a former US Treasury Secretary and ex-Chairman of Goldman Sachs, presided over the collapse of Citigroup while taking home $150 million in bonuses.
These Wall Street princes were smarter in one way, however: they managed to pocket a fortune while the rest of us are stuck with the mess they left behind.
These are economies that, even a decade ago, were losing market share to China and Asia, owing to their labor-intensive and low value-added exports.
Default and an exit from the euro would occur well before that.
Greece is currently too interconnected to be allowed to collapse: since it has about $400 billion of public debt – three-quarters of which is held abroad, mostly by European financial institutions – a disorderly default would lead to massive losses and risk a systemic crisis.
For now, the official community has decided to stick with Plan A; if that fails, Plan B is default to reduce unsustainable debts and a Greek exit from the eurozone to allow depreciation and restoration of competitiveness and growth.
It is not clear that other countries have the will or capacity to develop alternative engines of growth.
That encouraged investment spending, which in turn drove productivity gains and output growth.
Wages have stagnated despite strong productivity growth, while the trade deficit has set new records.
In this way, the Fed contributed to creating the sub-prime crisis.
But the eurozone’s leaders have not heeded their advice – and the consequences are becoming increasingly apparent.
The mistrust and fear that this elicits in the bond markets can lead to liquidity crises that, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, drive countries closer to default.
To overcome these obstacles, a eurozone debt-mutualization scheme must satisfy three crucial requirements.
In fact, Alexander Hamilton adopted this approach more than 200 years ago, when he decided to mutualize the debts that individual US states had incurred during the Revolutionary War – a decisive move toward further political integration.
Recent World Bank poverty recalculations are expected to raise the number even higher.
Many service-sector jobs are low-paying, precarious, and not covered by formal mechanisms of social protection.
Decent work also implies equality of opportunity and treatment as well as good prospects for both personal development and social inclusion.
In these circumstances, many are predicting America’s decline, especially relative to China.
Now it is the Chinese.
As for absolute decline, the US has very real problems, but the American economy remains highly productive. America remains first in total R&amp;D expenditure, first in university rankings, first in Nobel prizes, and first on indices of entrepreneurship.
Many commentators worry about America’s inefficient political system.
If so, the gloomy predictions of absolute American decline will turn out to be as misleading as similar predictions in decades past.
These decisions have become more alarming over time as the need for “more Europe” has become progressively more obvious.
But now even that is coming into question, thanks to Germany.
In opposition to almost every eurozone foreign minister or president, the chairman of Ecofin, and the European Central Bank’s president, Germany insisted that the International Monetary Fund be brought to the rescue of Greece, a brute denial of the principle of solidarity behind the euro.
It can still be avoided, but only if all Europeans remember their solidarity and act with unusual courage and tenacity.
Steps like these may have been overlooked in better economic times.
Moreover, conservatives who had aligned themselves with Ahmedinejad are now criticizing him openly.
Ahmedinejad may be making increasingly challenging statements, but he does not have the authority to act on them.
A long-sought peace agreement was secured for the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
For the Long Peace, the most intriguing explanation – and, I think, the most persuasive, though many may disagree – is that since the end of World War II, a fundamental normative shift has occurred among the major powers’ policymakers.
For optimists, what matters is believing in and nurturing the instinct of cooperation in the hope, and expectation, that decent human values will ultimately prevail.
Customers often value a good more when its price goes up.
Economic institutions can have different effects, depending on their quality.
Moreover, what seem like obvious, commonsense policy solutions all too often have unintended consequences, because a policy’s targets are not passive objects, as in physics, but active agents who react in unpredictable ways.
And it discourages younger, less credentialed economists from entering the public discourse.
Perhaps respectful debate in economics is possible only in academia.
EMR usage in America, the home of Apple and Google, stands at only 69%.
Within minutes, a seven year old can teach herself to play a complex game on an iPad.
The US government is trying to help.
The payoff will be worth it.
But the focus on agriculture diverted attention from a far broader agenda that could have been pursued in ways that would have benefited both North and the South.
Evidently, the Bush administration would rather help Middle East oil producers, whose interests so often seem at variance with those of the US, than Brazil.
As a result, much of the developing world is relieved that at least this risk has been avoided.
PARIS – Elections stolen in Iran, disputed in Afghanistan, and caricatured in Gabon: recent ballots in these and many other countries do not so much mark the global advance of democracy as demonstrate the absence of the rule of law.
Today’s despots view near-unanimous Soviet-style electoral “victories” as vulgar and old fashioned.
It is impossible to say to Afghanistan, for example, “You have deeply disappointed us, so, from now on, you must clean up your own mess.”
It is the West’s acceptance of corruption – either open or tacit – that makes it an accomplice to too many nefarious regimes, and makes its espousal of democratic principles appear either hypocritical or contradictory.
Sectarian conflict seems to be increasing on a daily basis, with militias massacring hundreds of Sunnis and Shiites solely on the basis of their religious identities.
Similarly, the survey found declining support for an Islamic state.
Curiously, in Tehran, Iran, the choice is markedly in favor of Iranian, rather than Muslim, identity.
So it appears that Iraqis are showing greater attachment to their national identity and are supportive of a non-sectarian approach to government.
Why, then, has India’s GDP growth slowed so much, from nearly 10% year on year in 2010-11 to 5% today? Was annual growth of almost 8% in the decade from 2002 to 2012 an aberration?
A similar story played out elsewhere.
To offset the collapse in demand from industrial countries, they had stimulated domestic demand.
By bringing together the key ministers, the committee has coordinated and accelerated decision-making, and has already approved tens of billions of dollars in spending in its first few meetings.
The project includes nine large industrial zones, high-speed freight lines, three ports, six airports, a six-lane expressway, and a 4,000-megawatt power plant.
Africa’s silent tsunami of malaria, however, is actually largely avoidable and controllable.
Poor countries cannot afford these investments on their own, so rich countries must help.
Malaria is an important example where specific investments can solve the problems of disease, hunger, and extreme poverty.
Moreover, with the “democratization” of aid now underway, we can look forward to increased private efforts alongside official development assistance.
Of course, governments need to run deficits in depressions in order to stimulate demand and stem rising unemployment.
A few have done so because they are making careers as party-line Republicans, so their priority is to tell Republican politicians what they want to hear (Josh Bolton and Mitch Daniels come to mind here).
But what is the right fiscal policy for a future Democratic administration to follow when there is no guarantee that any Republican successors will ever be “normal” again? That’s a hard question, and I don’t know the answer.
While the transformation may not always be seamless, there is no longer room to doubt that an Asian century is on the horizon, and that the world’s chemistry will change fundamentally.
Honest discussion of unpopular ideas is a key feature of an open society.
With 3% of the world’s population, the US can no longer dominate the rest of the world, because Asians, with 60% of the world’s population, are no longer underperforming.
In order to be prepared for the transformation, Americans must abandon ingrained ideas and old assumptions, and liberate unthinkable thoughts.
Indeed, today the market for derivatives is oligopolistic, with a few banks running huge profit margins.
To fix this problem, we need to move the bulk of derivative trading onto organized exchanges, where daily collateral requirements would guarantee systemic stability, and price transparency would force competition, reduce margins, and increase the market’s depth.
The United States currently spends $147 billion on obesity-related health care annually.
That is how human bodies are designed to metabolize food.
The liver mitochondria could not keep up with the energy onslaught, and had no choice but to employ a little-used escape valve called “de novo lipogenesis” (new fat-making) to turn excess energy substrate into liver fat.
Prior to 1900, Americans consumed less than 30 grams of sugar per day, or about 6% of total calories.
Of the 600,000 food items available in the US, 80% are laced with added sugar.
Extreme poverty is almost synonymous with extreme isolation, especially rural isolation.
If an individual does not have a cell phone, they almost surely know someone who does.
On the fully commercial side, the mobile revolution is creating a logistics revolution in farm-to-retail marketing.
In my book The End of Poverty , I wrote that extreme poverty can be ended by the year 2025.
The terror attacks demonstrated not only how particular people helped each other, but also how the whole city, with all the ingredients of its human mixture, displayed a common spirit of resilience.
Ethnic and cultural conflicts today, often in the form of terrorism, are not the eruption of a supposedly extinct volcano.
It is a far cry even from such doubtful claims as the self-determination of peoples defined as ethnic communities.
The Diplomacy of the Blind
Historical and geographic proximity, together with energy dependency and fear of massive immigration, paralyzed European diplomats.
By emphasizing the relations between states and governments over contacts with the opposition or civil societies (when they exist in an identifiable form), traditional diplomacy has created for itself a handicap that is difficult to overcome.
By being late in perceiving change that they do not want to see coming, Western diplomats run the risk of losing on both levels: the regime and the people.
But negotiation must also demonstrate that everything that could be done has in fact been done before further steps – especially the highly risky and fraught decision to take military action – are considered.
The Israelis also see with greater clarity than many in the world the nature of the likely successor regime in Syria (hint: it will probably not be comprised exclusively of Facebook and Twitter users).
Many countries will be unlikely to support a military solution until they have seen genuine efforts at other means of persuasion (and coercion) fail.
At first glance, much of Europe’s current debate is about political and economic integration – about how far its nation states should go in pooling resources and sovereign powers in the European Union.
About one-third of male workers in Europe quit their jobs by their early fifties.

Soon afterwards, many friends and I formed the International Committee for Democracy in Cuba.
Those of us who live in Europe’s new post-communist democracies experienced similar political deals when we lived behind the former Iron Curtain.
Many European politicians who have sought to see the situation on the ground have been barred in recent years.
We must never forget the seemingly anonymous victims of Castro’s “acts of rejection.”
“We must meet the forces of hate with soul force.”
In Gandhi’s own time, non-violence could have done nothing to prevent the slaughter of Jews in Hitler’s path.
Gandhi believed in “weaning an opponent from error by patience, sympathy, and self-suffering.”
Yet too few who have tried his methods worldwide have had his personal integrity or moral stature.
But his triumph did not “change the world forever.”
With those constraints gone, nationalism in both its Bismarckian state-making and ethnic state-breaking guises has gotten a second wind.
Moreover, it was achieved without a shot being fired.
Scottish nationalists do look longingly at Ireland, but for its recent phenomenal economic growth.
Equally, it is now far harder for Scots to blame a distant government in London for their problems, although the SNP will now try to make blaming Westminster for all ills even more of an art form.
The just-concluded deal establishes a bridge between the old climate regime and a new, as-yet-undefined one.
But the talks failed to deliver a comprehensive, legally binding agreement, causing investors to lose confidence in a low-carbon economy and delaying progress by several years.
The only hope is an international movement for immediate action, such as that which, in advance of the Copenhagen conference, compelled the world’s largest carbon emitters – including the United States and China – to set emissions targets.
The path to an international agreement strong enough to keep global warming under two degrees will be fraught with obstacles.
Successful multilateral trade negotiations have significantly shaped the world in which we live and have dramatically enhanced the lives of millions of people.
The non-discrimination principle ensured that global trade did not become a “spaghetti bowl” of preferential bilateral trade agreements.
Indeed, the current rush to bilateral trade agreements has been accompanied by a rise in protectionism.
It is not too late to reverse the apparently inexorable tide of bilateralism.
Indeed, the danger is already real: when I was in Geneva a year ago and staying at the upscale Mandarin Oriental, I asked the concierge how far away the WTO was. He looked at me and asked: “Is the World Trade Organization a travel agency?”
Never have cause and effect been so dramatically reversed in arguments over trade policy.
The Dollar and the Dragon
In this case, interdependence has created a “balance of financial terror” analogous to the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union never used their potential to destroy each other in a nuclear exchange.
While China has taken minor measures to slow the increase in its dollar-denominated holdings, it has been unwilling to risk a fully convertible currency for domestic political reasons.
This is not acceptable. This cannot last.”
CAMBRIDGE – The rapid rise in the price of oil and the sharp depreciation of the dollar are two of the most noteworthy developments of the past year.
The thinking behind the question of whether oil would cost less today if it were priced in euros seems to be that, since the dollar has fallen relative to the euro, this would have contained the rise in the price of oil.
That is only true to the extent that we think about the price of oil in dollars, since the dollar has fallen relative to other major currencies.
CAMBRIDGE – Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, recently suggested that replacing the dollar with the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights as the dominant reserve currency would bring greater stability to the global financial system.
But, while the euro’s international role – especially its use in financial markets – has increased since its inception, it is hard to envisage it overtaking the dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the foreseeable future.
Back in 1980, the IMF came close to adopting a so-called SDR Substitution Account.
What about possible losses suffered by the Substitution Account? This can be dealt with by setting aside part of the IMF’s large gold stock.
Supported by a dollar-denominated line of credit, the EPU’s 15 Western European member states established exact dollar exchange-rate parities as a prelude to anchoring their domestic price levels and removing all currency restrictions on intra-European trade.
Moreover, the US protests other countries’ exchange-rate policies.
The claim that exchange-rate appreciation will reduce a country’s trade surplus is false, because, in globally integrated economies, domestic investment falls when the exchange rate appreciates.
The cooperation of China, now the world’s largest exporter and US creditor, is essential for easing and encouraging the transition to this nirvana.
What makes their struggle loom so large for a normally quiescent Egyptian public is partly that nearly all 9,000 judges are standing fast in solidarity.
Now only 350,000 serve in the military, while the internal security police recently hit the one-million mark.
These symbolic as well as lethal warnings to a family that has grown Pharaonic in scale, style, and power have gone unheeded.
Justice is a central value for Egyptians, and its absence is at the core of all protests.
It is not long ago that job creation was negative and the unemployment rate stood at 10%.
And, remember, this number excludes all the discouraged Americans who are no longer looking for a job.
The economy is still struggling to provide a sufficient number of jobs for those who were previously employed in leverage-driven activities that are no longer sustainable (let alone desirable).
A better mix of fiscal and monetary policies and sustained measures to enhance productivity and competitiveness remain necessary conditions for addressing America’s labor-market challenges.
In 1969, the Chinese and Soviet armies exchanged fire across their disputed border.
As a general principle of foreign policy, China believes that national borders are sacrosanct.
Other than oil, gas, and other commodities, China has rather limited interests in Russia.
As for Russia’s Far East, the Chinese believe it will eventually fall to China anyway, so there is no need to hasten the process.
Clarke and von Braun encountered a wall of skepticism when their proposals first appeared.
The movie depicted a large space station, a winged space shuttle, a lunar base, and astronauts on a trip to the outer solar system.
Nor has the US space shuttle accomplished its goals.
Kubrick suggested that people – accompanied by a computer – would pilot spacecraft to explore planets like Jupiter and Saturn.
The Dutch Retreat
The Germans, in particular, have no stomach for military aggression, hence their reluctance in Afghanistan to take on anything but simple police tasks.
Then, too, pacifism had nothing to do with what happened.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO suddenly found itself without a clear goal (and the Germans no longer needed to be kept down).
The only solution to this problem is for Europeans to reduce their dependence on the US and take greater responsibility for their own defense.
This resulted in crop failures and famine, and some historians argue that it helped to precipitate the French Revolution.
Although it is too early to judge, opinion polls suggest that the British people do at least like the look and the purpose of the current one.
The Conservatives have agreed to hold a referendum on whether Britain should change its first-past-the-post electoral system to an alternative-vote arrangement.
The Liberals, meanwhile, have a golden opportunity to show that they are capable of government, rather than simply flakey representatives of the “None of the Above” party.
A “New Institutional Economics” (NIE) gained ground by filling in the gaps left by mainstream models, which ignored the central importance of institutions in managing the change and uncertainty that affect resource allocation and social choice.
Fukuyama argues that patrimonialism – defined as the natural human propensity to favor family and friends – is the bane of the rule of law and accountable government.
North argues that competition is a key force driving adaptive efficiency among institutions.
The meeting is a welcome development. But Abe comes into office with a reputation as a stronger nationalist than his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, whose insistence on visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine (where Class A war criminals from World War II are buried) helped sour relations with China.
Containment was unfeasible, because, unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, China’s neighbors did not see it as a clear and present danger.
The key to military power in today’s information age depends on the ability to integrate complex systems of space-based surveillance, high speed computers, and “smart” weapons.
The most contentious issue, however, has been prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and, until Abe’s visit, China had been reluctant to engage in any summit meetings with Japan so long as such visits continue.
The US should quietly try to nudge these steps forward.
Its promise to act was enough to calm markets.
It might seem odd for foreigners to weigh in on a question of German law. But the stakes are too high to remain on the sidelines.
In particular, they did not see the Fed as a lender of last resort.
The OMT program is a step in this direction.
The ECB should act with greater alacrity not because there are increased prospects for future growth, but for the opposite reason: the fear that European growth will slow, thus limiting the possibility for future rate hikes.
This implies an interval of two months between interest-rate moves instead of the three-month interval that has become standard ECB practice in the current interest-rate cycle. The next rate hike in the normalization process is expected in October, two months after the expected August move.
But the recent good economic numbers coming out of France should make an October rate hike easier for French politicians to accept.
The problem is that a very long list of exceptions reduces the recoverable assets to such an extent that in many cases it will still be impossible to make do without public money.
Instead, by weakening safety standards, bailing out foreign investors, and financing current-account deficits, the ECB has undercut and replaced the private European interbank market.
In each case, a major objective was to reduce the burden on the ECB, which had advanced the money by printing it and would have run into serious difficulties without help.
Sarkozy stands ready to pounce on any mistakes the Bank may make in this more difficult policy environment.
The euro is at record levels, oil prices are surging and interest rates are expected to go higher.
But if it goes too fast, the political cost could be substantial and irreversible. Politicians will push for more control and probably get it, Maastricht treaty or no Maastricht treaty.
There is no doubt that Sarkozy’s attacks on the ECB are having a counter-productive effect in this regard.
The ECB’s surprise liquidity operation put the continent’s crisis on hold.
And German public-sector workers obtained an agreement at the end of March that boosts wages by 6.3% in the coming two years.
Where spending cuts should, in principle, help to dampen inflation, European governments, like that of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, are backtracking on their budgetary commitments.
The ECB will object, not without reason, that monetary policy is a blunt instrument with which to rebalance the European economy.
But now the ECB no longer wants to do it, and is urging eurozone members to step in.
The amount of the ECB’s “replacement lending” is shown by the so-called Target2 account, which measures the deficit or surplus of a country’s financial transactions with other countries.
Unconventional measures were necessary to prevent their economies from collapsing.
Setting a cap on Target accounts is a fundamentally more appropriate policy to keep current-account deficits in check than the wage policies contemplated by the new Pact for the Euro.
But the announcement of this policy change at the February meeting also did not go smoothly.
Calm economic waters had given the ECB and Trichet a honeymoon until last fall.
The ECB should be preparing Europeans for what many of its own officials admit in private: Europe has not “de-coupled” from the US.
Yet these tools are relentlessly misrepresented to the public.
And GM crops currently in development will deliver even more direct and easily identifiable consumer benefits.
As a result, by 2007, global corn and soybean prices were nearly 6% and 10% lower, respectively, than they would have been had farmers not embraced these crops.
STANFORD – November’s mid-term elections were a sharp rebuke to the vast expansion of government spending, deficits, and debt in the United States.
Moreover, the changed Congressional landscape will be better for trade-related legislation.
A showdown also looms over tax policy.
Meanwhile, most political analysts do not expect Obama to make as large a move to the political center as President Bill Clinton did when the Republicans took control of Congress after the 1994 mid-term elections.
NEW YORK – Political turmoil in the Middle East has powerful economic and financial implications, particularly as it increases the risk of stagflation, a lethal combination of slowing growth and sharply rising inflation.
But there is a serious chance that the uprisings will spread, destabilizing Bahrain, Algeria, Oman, Jordan, Yemen, and eventually even Saudi Arabia.
If oil prices rise much further – towards the peaks of 2008 – the advanced economies will slow sharply; many might even slip back into recession.
The goal should be to stabilize these countries’ economies as they undertake their delicate political transitions.
Now, imagine that, of that total, the companies pay out $250 in dividends (which you reinvest to buy more stock) and retain $450 in earnings to reinvest in their businesses.
But there appear to be two main explanations.
The first reason betrays a lack of trust that governments can and will do the job that they learned how to do in the Great Depression: keep the flow of spending stable so that big depressions with long-lasting, double-digit unemployment do not recur.
For the past quarter-century, a major agenda item for the international development organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has been to bolster developing nations’ financial markets.
Worse still for some theories of what makes financial markets flourish are the examples of the US, Great Britain, and Japan.
In a stable political environment, informal mechanisms – such as reputations for reliability, trade associations, and stock exchanges – can develop and facilitate financial dealings. Investors and businesses don’t fear that a new regime can take power and call off all, or too many, bets, leading to losses on their investments.
By contrast, democratic regimes with widespread property ownership typically best protect property rights over the long term, because enough people in the polity want to protect property.
A quicker and more concerted response might have limited the fall-out from the crisis, and thus its cost.
The European Central Bank has played a crucial role in preventing a worst-case scenario, but the obvious lacuna in Europe’s economic and monetary union (EMU) remains: EMU established only a monetary union and largely omitted the economic union that has proven so closely linked to the euro’s strengths and weaknesses.
This intergovernmental approach lay behind the Lisbon Agenda’s failure to deliver the results needed to make Europe more competitive and dynamic by 2010, and the same shortcomings will bedevil its successor, the new “Europe 2020” strategy.
I have been arguing for a Community Act that would bring together all elements of economic governance under a single framework, with the European Commission at its center.
Against this backdrop, the time has come to reconsider the basic sources of happiness in our economic life.
Here are some of the initial conclusions.
It is weakening social trust and mental stability, with the prevalence of clinical depression apparently on the rise. The mass media have become outlets for corporate “messaging,” much of it overtly anti-scientific, and Americans suffer from an increasing range of consumer addictions.
CAMBRIDGE – As the world watches the United States grapple with its fiscal future, the contours of the battle reflect larger social and philosophical divisions that are likely to play out in various guises around the world in the coming decades.
The government, of course, is the consummate service-intensive sector.
So, even as economic conservatives demand spending cuts, there are strong forces pushing in the other direction.
But one should not presume that a shift to greater private-sector provision of services is a panacea.
The Economics of Peace in Afghanistan
Unless the participants are empowered and take ownership, programs will not be sustainable, resources will go to waste, and peace will not endure.
In doing so, remember that the “vagueness versus specificity” dilemma also applies to economic issues.
This often means accepting that optimal and best-practice economic policies are not attainable – or, indeed, even desirable.
Final sales to households, businesses, and foreign buyers rose at only a 1.1% annual rate, even slower than earlier in the year.
Even those who are working are seeing their incomes shrink.
Industrial production has been unchanged for the past two months, and utilization of industrial capacity has declined.
But the state of the economy is usually the most important determinant of who wins national elections in the United States.
Why hasn’t the huge spike in oil prices cut the world to its knees, as it has on so many other occasions? Again, the answer is low interest rates.
As a consequence, they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view, rightly or wrongly, as safe vehicles.
True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950’s and early 1960’s, when Europe, the US, and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth.
Certain individuals, however, are more susceptible to the negative effects of its use.
Of course, the existence of a positive correlation between cannabis use and psychosis does not allow us to draw a direct causal link between the two.
A comparison of the two most common types of cannabis in the United Kingdom, hash and sinsemilla (“skunk”), found that using skunk implied a significantly greater risk of psychosis, while hash did not.
However, a recent study that followed people from birth to age 38 found that those who started using cannabis early, every day, and for several years had a permanent 8-point drop in IQ scores.
With its 85 million people and strategically vital location, Egypt is the most important country on the Mediterranean’s southern shore.
That precedent is, without doubt, dangerous for a fledgling democracy.
The project is being pursued in the face of strong Egyptian objections – military intervention has been threatened – yet it continues apace.
Turkish foreign policy had sought to create a regional order, with the participation of other Sunni Islamic regimes, in accordance with the country’s interests.
Those who filled Tahrir Square 16 months ago were silenced, and the expected transfer of power from the military to a civilian, democratic government was thrown into doubt.
Others do not believe that the Muslim Brotherhood will go so far, but nonetheless doubt that the Brothers will defend a secular, truly democratic regime in the ongoing negotiations with SCAF on a transition to civilian rule.
For now, the Brothers have announced that they will name a Christian and a woman as Vice Presidents.
Unfortunately, while angry protesters have sometimes forced unwelcome rulers out of power, they have been unable to replace tyrants with governments that respect the public’s wishes.
The army’s lower ranks are now filled with young men, drawn from all segments of Egyptian society, whose backgrounds are no different from those of the people they may be called upon to suppress.
Mubarak’s promise that he would not run for re-election this coming September, which might have mollified his critics two weeks earlier, was no longer enough.
Should violence increase, ordinary soldiers would likely once again feel duty-bound to intervene to restore order and prevent further bloodshed.
Namun demikian, dampak keseluruhannya sering dinilai tidak cukup, khususnya di negara-negara yang rentan atau sedang mengalami konflik – dan MDG telah gagal memasukkan keberlanjutan di dalam targetnya.
Keputusan-keputusan yang diambil pada tahun ini, pada pertemuan puncak SDG dan konferensi iklim di Paris pada bulan Desember, akan memiliki dampak yang besar bagi masa depan planet kita.
Globalisasi telah menyebabkan lemahnya kontrak sosial di dalam negara-bangsa dan bahkan antar benua.
Untuk menerapkan SDG dan mengurangi perubahan iklim, perubahan besar diperlukan untuk beranjak dari model ekonomi kita yang bergantung pada bahan bakar fosil.
These new forms of money sound like power windows on cars, or remote control for TV sets.
The reason is straightforward.
One could easily establish and operate a business selling food by the serving or providing small household items to anyone who happened to pass by.
This fee structure makes it difficult to run a business selling items for less than ten dollars, and impossible to run a business selling items for less than one dollar: transaction costs eat up the profits.
What iTunes sells is one form of intellectual content.
India’s last two governments each served a full term and presided over significant economic growth, even though they comprised 23 and 20 parties, respectively.
In that case, a “hung parliament” could see a “third front” coming to power as a minority government, supported tactically by one of the big parties.
The BJP, which accuses Congress of “appeasing” India’s minorities, hews to a staunchly Hindu-chauvinist line, and has received support from some of the most bigoted and intolerant sections of Indian society.
Indian democracy has often been likened to the stately progress of the elephant – ponderous in its gait and reluctant to change course, but not easily swayed from its new path when it does.
Indigenous children have a significantly lower chance of educational success. Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Paraguay lag behind even other Latin American countries.
First, there is credible evidence that children who are better nourished in their first years of life stay in school longer and learn more each year that they remain there.
In Colombia, scholarships were provided to 125,000 students from poor, urban communities in the early 1990’s.
The most expensive programs aren’t necessarily the most successful.
Thus, “’68” symbolized the end of revolutionary myths – to the benefit of liberation movements extending from the 1970’s until now.
In France, conservatism was so entrenched on both the left and the right that both missed the movement’s meaning and could only fall back on stereotyped revolutionary interpretations.
Of course, some people have never overcome the end of the ecstasy of those five weeks of craziness and joy, while others still wait for “’68” to culminate in God only knows what kind of “D-Day.”
That world has been replaced by a multilateral world, which includes AIDS, unemployment, energy and climate crises, and so on.
At the moment, the Financial Stability Board, whose members include the G-20 countries, mainly pursues initiatives in this field.
Emerging economies, following the advanced countries, also attached less importance to Fund surveillance, especially as their accumulation of external assets made them less dependent on IMF financing and advice.
An example of this is the way the IMF’s Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members’ Policies, aimed at identifying fundamental exchange-rate misalignments, was modified to allow greater discretion in surveillance, especially over exchange rates.
The real danger is that adjustment would take place even later, with imbalances left to accumulate for a longer period of time.
But, while things are not developing as American neo-conservatives had intended, they are nevertheless developing.
Today, the old Middle East can still be found in Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, and Fatah-controlled Palestine.
The dominant conflict is no longer the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, but the threat of a confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia for sub-regional supremacy, and between Iran and the US for regional hegemony.
More generally, the currency of conventional military power in the Middle East would largely lose its value, inevitably resulting in a regional nuclear arms race.
So, what will they do – and, perhaps more important, what will economic forces do to them?
Unless the renminbi falls in value, this translates into an average nominal increase of at least 10-11% in dollar terms.
More focus on innovation and creativity will be accompanied by strong real wage growth, provision of greater rights for urban migrants, and expansion of health care and pensions.
One is growing evidence of a housing recovery; the other is the prospect of steadily declining energy-import costs as domestic production, particularly of natural gas, continues to rise.
Emerging-market economies have not only cushioned the global impact of the recent crisis, but have also helped industrialized countries reverse the recessionary trend of 2008-2009.
During the crisis, annual growth slowed, but only to 6.7%, reflecting the economy’s inherent resilience.
While the public sector will continue to play an important role, given the massive investment required, substantial private investment – including foreign investment – would be needed to address India’s huge “infrastructure deficit” and the financing gap that accompanies it.
The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Rather than a “clash of civilizations,” we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
It has become an obsession.
The Empire of Human Rights
Indeed, none of the Asian members disagreed when the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.
You are obliged to take care of your family, your friends, or even your fellow countrymen.
It has, nonetheless, become a commonly held opinion that democracy, like universal human rights, is a typically Western idea, and that Asian autocracy, as practiced in China, for example, is not only more suited to Asians, but also more efficient.
But, despite a flurry of early initiatives, the world remains as far from that goal as ever.
The G-20 promised stronger global institutions to prevent this from recurring.
But the greater voice and voting power that they were promised – commensurate with their status as four of the IMF’s top ten shareholders – has not been delivered.
But the Bank is also hampered by worsening resource constraints, as the biggest post-crisis capital infusions went to regional development banks.
The End of an Era in Finance
The IMF’s policy note makes clear that controls on cross-border financial flows can be not only desirable, but also effective.
There is some empirical research on the consequences of capital controls in countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Malaysia, but very little systematic research on the appropriate menu of options.
Set at a very low level – 0.05% is a commonly mentioned rate – such a tax would raise hundreds of billions of dollars for global public goods while discouraging short-term speculative activities in financial markets.
BARCELONA ­– Are banks doomed as a result of the current financial crisis? The securitization of mortgages originally was seen as a triumph, because it shifted risk to financial markets, while taking deposits and making and monitoring loans – the purview of traditional banks – was regarded as narrow and old-fashioned.
Others may follow soon.
Indeed, even if things turned ugly and banks’ equity suffered, executives knew that their own generous bonuses and pension packages most likely would not.
But when you can play with others’ money and expect a very high reward for success and no punishment for failure, the incentives for irresponsible risk-taking become enormous.
This diminishes the value of these countries’ foreign-exchange reserves, endangers their fiscal and exchange-rate policies, and undermines their financial security.
Despite such low returns, China has continued to invest its reserves in the US, largely owing to the inability of its own under-developed financial market to generate a sufficient supply of safe assets.
The End of China’s Surplus
After all, the policies that China will implement in the next few years target the country’s enormous saving rate – the cause of its large current-account surplus.
These policies are motivated by domestic considerations, as the Chinese government seeks to raise living standards more rapidly than the moderating growth rate of GDP.
This would cause a shift from exports to production for the domestic market, thereby shrinking the trade surplus, in addition to curbing inflation.
Macroeconomists celebrated the “Great Moderation” of the global business cycle, with recessions seeming to become milder and less frequent.
It is ironic indeed that US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, a former head of Goldman Sachs, a firm that exemplifies financial triumphalism, is spearheading the effort to save government-sponsored behemoths that have so conspicuously outlived their usefulness.
For a while, it consistently made outsized profits, supposedly due to its Nobel-prize backed financial expertise.
Financial innovation ought to be allowed to flourish, but not without better checks and balances.
Maastricht was thus intended to prevent a situation like the current one in Greece.
In theory, strict in-depth monitoring could distinguish genuinely prudent countercyclical responses from profligacy. But in practice it is hard to enforce.
Moreover, in the United States, there are rules and conventions (similar to Maastricht) that disallow or discourage states from running long-term deficits.
The EU’s leaders recently stated their intention to revisit the Maastricht structure, which in principle is a good idea.
That would enable effective enforcement of fiscal discipline at the national level and provide the euro with the fiscal discipline it needs to survive.
But, despite street protests, the collective reaction in Japan has not been to repudiate nuclear energy.
Germany’s nuclear plants will be replaced by more thermal plants, implying a large increase in German carbon emissions – so much for Green concern with global warming! And so much for intellectual honesty, because a Germany without nuclear power of its own will be compelled to buy it from France, which has no intention of closing its nuclear plants.
The great irony of the current situation is that real innovation and entrepreneurial activity, without government support, is taking place in the field of energy generation, such as in the creation of miniaturized nuclear reactors.
The End of History Comes to Tunisia
But, while a widespread consensus held that communism was nothing but a dead end, China’s economic success, and the authoritarian backlash in Russia following Boris Yeltsin’s departure from the Kremlin a decade ago, prompted a more pessimistic analysis.
Challenging the “myth of the autocratic revival,” the American political scientists Daniel Deudney and John Ikenberry have examined China and Russia, finding “little evidence for the emergence of a stable equilibrium between capitalism and autocracy such that this combination could be dignified as a new model of modernity.” While neither country qualifies as a liberal democracy, both “are much more liberal and democratic than they have ever been, and many of the crucial foundations for sustainable liberal democracy are emerging” – one main hurdle being the centrifugal forces that democracy might unleash.
Moreover, Tunisia’s revolution was indigenous, not imported as part of some forcible regime change.
But history does not end, and it is forever full of surprises.
In Europe, the Vatican lobbied for acknowledgement of God in the preamble to the proposed European Constitutional Treaty.
The response by enlightened communities is therefore important.
South Africa’s internal problems, most notably the upsurge in the AIDS epidemic, have been well documented since the ANC came to power more than ten years ago, but the country’s stance as a player within the international community has been less obvious.
Such powers seek an effective and constructive regional role, and possibly, in some instances, a global one.
In the face of Western and, in particular, American skepticism about South Africa’s failure, and that of the Africa Union, to engineer an acceptable outcome to the Zimbabwean crisis, money may not be forthcoming.
3. A government that kept its nose out of people’s economic business.
That foundation had a hard enough time functioning when human societies had 60 members – eight orders of magnitude less than our current global society’s six billion.
We also believe that government should play a powerful role in managing the market to avoid large depressions, redistributing income to produce higher social welfare, and preventing pointless industrial structuring produced by the fads and fashions that sweep the minds of financiers.
The write-off of multilateral debt for the world’s poorest countries – thanks to Britain’s leadership – is nonetheless especially welcome.
Of course, not all foreign-aid money is well spent.
A simple project like this can make an enormous difference to the life of a community.
Equally important, historically much foreign aid was provided not to promote development, but to purchase friendship, especially during the Cold War.
Total capital assets of central banks worldwide amount to $18 trillion, or 19% of global GDP – twice the level of ten years ago. This gives them plenty of ammunition to guide market interest rates lower as they combat the weakest recovery since the Great Depression.
The result will be chain reactions similar to those seen in Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, with a vicious circle of sovereign and bank debt leading to credit-rating downgrades and a sharp increase in bond yields. Japan’s own debt crisis will then erupt with full force.
Moreover, China’s aging population, and its strategy of boosting domestic consumption, will negatively affect global savings.
During the global financial crisis, even the safety of bank deposits and government bonds was in doubt for some investors.
Thus, firms have little pricing power, owing to excess capacity, while workers’ bargaining power is low, owing to high unemployment.
The time to buy gold is when the real returns on cash and bonds are negative and falling.
But, given the absence of any conspiracy, falling inflation, and the inability to use gold as a currency, such arguments cannot be sustained.
Ten years ago, comparing the reform processes in China and Russia was an intellectual fashion.
Indeed, Russia is more a fragile oil-producing state than a modernizing economic giant.
The diverse paths followed by Russia and China may be explained in part by how the two peoples perceive themselves.
The gap between the respective qualities of China’s economic and scientific elites, on the one hand, and its ruling political elites, on the other, is simply too monumental – and still growing – for stability to be taken for granted.
But, however fundamental the current differences might be, it is the underlying suspicion that Obama is poised to shift America away from its unique relationship with the Jewish state that most worries Israelis.
Devoid of sentimental attachment to Israel’s cause and deeply disturbed by its policies in the occupied territories, Obama represents the specter of a White House where neither love nor interests are shared with the Jewish state.
It is because Netanyahu is driven by an almost Messianic determination to prevent Iran from acquiring the means to destroy Israel, that he might be amenable to a fundamental change in his position on Palestine, provided Obama makes visible headway in his drive to stop Iran’s nuclear program.
From a military perspective, Israel eventually won all of these wars – or at least didn’t lose them.
Everything else is evil wishful thinking for which more innocents will continue losing their lives.
Whatever becomes of Hamas in military terms following the recent fighting in Gaza, politically it has finally taken over the PLO’s role as the legitimate representative of the Palestinians.
The alternative to a two-state solution is continuation of the conflict and the de facto reality of a one-state solution in which Palestinians between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean will, sooner rather than later, constitute a majority.
After a victory by the left-wing Syriza party, Greece’s new government announces that it wants to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.
His government fails to get the necessary support from voters and resigns, throwing the country into full-blown political chaos.
China’s government decides that it cannot risk further strife and announces a package of measures to boost economic growth and prevent layoffs, including direct financial support for exporters and intervention in the currency markets to weaken the renminbi.
Those that do relatively well share three characteristics: low levels of public debt, limited dependence on exports or capital flows, and robust democratic institutions.
Many years later, Merkel, who has withdrawn from politics and become a recluse, is asked whether she thinks that she should have done anything differently during the euro crisis.&nbsp; Unfortunately, her answer comes too late to change the course of history.
But China's labor productivity is now growing at roughly 6% per year.
Things have value when they are both desirable and scarce.
At the same time, the United States will oppose any Iranian nuclear program – even a civilian program – because this will contribute to the stability of the regime in Tehran.
Nuclear power offers the possibility of cheap, plentiful electricity, which will contribute to social and political stability.
However, domestic pressure, a sense of nationalism, and the need to improve its bargaining position with Western countries might force the Iranian government to respond to harsh UN sanctions or an air attack on its nuclear facilities.
MILAN – I have been surprised by the recent coverage in the American press of gasoline prices and politics.
On the supply side, there is a similar difference between short-term and longer-run effects.
A substantial failure of education about non-renewable natural resources lies in the background of current public sentiment.
Now these policies have to be reversed, which implies similar political challenges and costs.
If criticism of democratic governance on the grounds of its “inevitable short time horizon” were correct, it would be hard to explain how India, a populous, complex, and still-poor democracy, could sustain long-term investments and policies required to support rapid growth and development.
At some point, voters will react against a system that amplifies differences and suppresses shared goals, and policy formation will revert to its more effective pragmatic mode.
Yet the undoubted origin of the conflict is the region’s extreme poverty, which was made disastrously worse in the 1980’s by a drought that has essentially lasted until today.
The economic takeoff of these two giants started 40 years ago with the introduction of higher agricultural output and an end to famines.
Thus, environmental pressures are now hitting the bottom line – affecting incomes and livelihoods around the world.
At the global level, the world’s governments should finally understand that the treaties that they have all signed in recent years on climate, environment, and biodiversity are at least as important to global security as all of the war zones and crisis hotspots that grab the headlines, budgets, and attention.
In fact, the exploitation of non-renewable resources frees the speed of economic growth from that of ecological renewal, aggravating the deterioration of the biosphere, including irreversible climate changes.
The only way to overcome the finiteness of our world is to maintain as much space as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research aimed at increasing renewable energies, reducing the energy intensity of our standards of living, and slowing the pace of environmental erosion.
The Commission’s approach is misguided.
But their ability to grow is being impaired because they lack the resources to confront the massive business lobbies of the EU’s most developed and richest countries.
Additional emissions would occur when the goods are transported back to the EU.
The Error of the War on Terror
The war-on-terror concept stands in the way of recognizing this fact because it separates “us” from “them” and denies that our actions may shape their behavior.
This contributed to Hamas’s electoral victory.
Similarly, the US has become less safe since President Bush declared war on terror.
The people of Palestine yearn for peace and relief from suffering.
Russians are particularly outraged by Putin’s arrogant treatment of the presidency as an office that can be “loaned” to allies – like the current incumbent, Dmitri Medvedev – and reclaimed whenever he wishes.
Nor does he have any anxiety about the damage that his misrule portends for Russia’s future.
No one should be deceived by any concessions that the Kremlin makes.
The Eternal Life of America’s Megabanks
Essentially, this is a form of bankruptcy, but with more administrative discretion (and presumably more protection for depositors) than would be possible in a court-supervised process.
This is exactly what happened when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, and what happened when AIG was taken over by the US government (actually in a resolution-type structure, with losses implied for creditors) two days later.
And of course the credit markets know this, so they lend more cheaply to JP Morgan Chase and other megabanks than to smaller banks that really can fail.
Putin can’t help himself, just as he couldn’t help himself in 2004.
The only freedom Russians have left is to devise bitter jokes that tap the country’s rich historical stores of political pathology. If they could export them, they would be as rich as Germans.
Today, Russia’s rulers have never looked more arbitrary and illegitimate. After 12 years in power, and grasping for 12 more, Putin can no longer sustain the pretense of adhering to democracy and promoting modernization.
The Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989 much more rapidly than most West Germans would have dreamed (or dreaded).
It is no longer a traumatic experience, just a bureaucratic hassle.
As time goes by, Israelis and Palestinians increasingly want to divorce themselves from each other.
The British minister responsible for the test justified the idea by claiming that “the simple act of taking one’s turn is one of the things that holds our country together. It is very important that newcomers take their place in queues whether it is for a bus or a cup of tea.”
It is clearly helpful for immigrants to get hints about how to navigate daily life practically – such as norms about standing in line.
They are akin to language requirements – except that the language here is a civic, not a national one, which in the best case allows new citizens to voice their concerns with perfect political grammar.
The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called “white” – actually pale pink – veal, newborn calves are separated from their mothers, deliberately made anemic, denied roughage, and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around.
Conditions are, if anything, even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage, she would be unable to stretch her wings.
The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible, so that she can be made pregnant again, but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter.
BRUSSELS – Two decades ago, Ethiopia was a Cold War battlefield.
Further south, Kenya remains scarred by the aftermath of post-election violence, and its constitutional review process could lead to yet more bloodshed.
Furthermore, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has created what amounts to a one-party state during his 24 years in power, yet he is feted in the West as one of Africa’s visionary leaders.
Ethiopia’s diplomacy will be vital to minimizing the potential for such violence to spread, but Ethiopia can fulfill this role only if it receives strong strategic backing from the West.
The withdrawal of Britain’s Paddy Ashdown as a candidate for the post of UN envoy in Afghanistan means that the international community still has some way to go before it speaks with one voice in that country.
Apart from 1,500 Dutch soldiers in the neighboring Uruzgan province and a Polish and Romanian presence in Ghazni, Paktika, and Zabul, no other EU nations are willing to operate in the insurgency-ridden southern and eastern parts of the country, giving the Taliban free reign.
They fear that more troops may only lead to more civilian casualties, antagonizing Afghans.
And it is to be hoped that whoever is chosen may be able to foster the grand bargain between the US and EU that is so badly needed.
But two steep hurdles still need to be overcome: the intergovernmental conference and ratification through the national parliaments or by means of a referendum in all member states.
Twenty years seems to be what it takes Europe to change, and that is anything but reassuring.
The recalcitrant states achieved a Pyrrhic victory because it will quickly become clear to them that, even if the EU is getting a new institutional framework, the avantgarde countries will decide among themselves what the concrete arrangements will look like.
Fourth, Poland has to ask itself what kind of role it wants to play within the EU.
The time for celebrations will come only after the new treaty is ratified.
Roughly a third of Darfur’s population has been forced from their homes and are now in displaced persons camps inside Sudan, where they remain subject to the Janjaweed terror, or in equally vulnerable refugee settlements in Chad. International humanitarian efforts to help those in Sudan are hampered by Sudanese government harassment and pointless bureaucratic hassles.
At that time, it appeared that a similar breakthrough in western Sudan would follow.
In accordance with the “responsibility to protect” doctrine, adopted unanimously by heads of state and government at the UN World Summit in September 2005, if a state fails to meet this primary obligation, responsibility shifts to the international community, which may exercise various measures, including, if absolutely necessary, military force.
Such targeted sanctions would affect the power and privileges of the key players in this crisis.
Nor do they say much about the obvious dividends that such spending could provide, from the United Kingdom in the west to the EU’s newest candidate country, Croatia, in the east.
And yet the penny has not dropped in London that focusing European investment funds accordingly would create opportunities to build stronger businesses and increase competitiveness in the technologies of the future – and to share these gains within and beyond the EU.
Will Ukraine continue its turn towards the West, as Yushchenko and his Orange Revolution ally Yuliya Tymoshenko want, or return to Russia’s strategic embrace, as Yanukovych and his allies want?
Of course, EU membership gives these countries a greater sense of security.
All of these countries are now acting with great hesitation in the debate about Kosovo, clearly influenced by Russian warnings about “setting a precedent.”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel likes to emphasize, rightly, that one should not speak of a “euro crisis,” but of a “debt crisis.”
But why should a debt problem in economies that are usually called “peripheral” be so important for financial markets? Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, which is now teetering on the brink of insolvency, account for less than 6% of the eurozone economy.
The key areas of weakness in Europe’s financial markets, including undercapitalized banks in core countries, were not addressed, and the system was not able to withstand the second wave of the crisis, triggered by the peripheral countries’ loss of credibility in financial markets.
That, rather than elaborate mechanisms for economic-policy coordination or grand designs for competitiveness, should be at the top of the European Council’s agenda.
Economic integration, it was hoped, would lead to greater understanding, underpinned by the myriad interactions that inevitably flow from commerce.
Indeed, Europe’s success is due in part to its promotion of a set of values that, while quintessentially European, are at the same time global.
Fine distinctions are made, for example, between the rights of citizens and non-citizens.
COPENHAGEN – So far, Europe’s leaders seem to be mostly preoccupied with finding national answers to the global economic crisis.
But then the financial system crumbled growth rates fell like a ton of bricks. The new democracies were shaken as public protests erupted in some of their capitals, and some governments have fallen.
Thus, the sheer magnitude of the task of reviving these economies is not overwhelming. But the political consequences of failure to deliver a message of genuine European solidarity will be.
Solidarity among members is not just something we talk about when the future looks bright and rosy.
Energy, transport infrastructure – roads, railways, and waterways – and crime prevention have all benefited.
To be sure, the EU’s lengthy internal crisis over the proposed constitution was a major distraction, and damaged the Union’s reputation in the Balkans.
Israel’s European Peace?
The nature and posture of the new military-led regime remains to be seen.
Yet the Palestinian Authority demanded their release, Israel’s government obliged, and the US supported the transaction.
Given the EU’s robust relationship with Israel – underpinned by its role as Israel’s largest trade partner, accounting for roughly 26% of total Israeli exports and 34% of its imports – it can develop powerful incentives that could provide the impetus that the peace process needs to succeed.
This is particularly visible in the banking sector.
A government default would thus wipe out the entire Greek banking system.
The definition of what banks should hold for liquidity purposes should have been broadened beyond public debt to include a wide range of private-sector assets based on market size.
Europe’s Smart Asian Pivot
Moreover, the EU has a somewhat paradoxical asset at its disposal: it is not a Pacific power and does not carry the burden of great-power status in Asia.
When the territorial dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands flared anew last year, Japanese auto exports to China plummeted 80% in just three months.
China is facing increasing pressure (particularly from the US) to assume a global political role that corresponds to its economic weight.
Though country-to-country engagement with Asia’s rising powers may be tempting, and while China often prefers bilateral dealings, renationalization of EU members’ foreign policies would be counterproductive.
A half-century of working together, plus a decade and a half of adapting to new threats and demands, is paying off.
So the Taliban are obtaining ample funds from the heroin trade – easily Afghanistan’s largest single source of foreign earnings.
Turf battles with NATO intrude, as well as competition between the EU’s executive Commission and the member-based Council.
But NATO is also acting because some European countries want to show Washington that they can pull their security weight even though they refuse to go near the war in Iraq.
So long as it performed these functions, Austria was viewed as a “European necessity” – a balancer of nationalities and of nations for which there was no conceivable substitute.
Like Austria-Hungary, the EU’s raison d’etre consists in its ability to transcend the indigenous balance of power among its members, and the service this renders to the international system.
But, as Habsburg history shows, such arrangements create entrenched privileges among the “haves” and grudges among the “have-nots.” In a union of many parts, there are no shortcuts: the EU must provide the same level of integration at the periphery as at the imperial core.
The EU vs. Democracy
For example, Bolivia TV devoted 62.7% of its news bulletins to the government party’s candidates, whereas the seven opposition parties combined mustered only a 37.2% share.  This, according to Weber, amounted to an “abuse of institutional propaganda.”
Nor have they shrunk from constitutional tinkering in order to lock in their power. Indeed, they have changed the constitution three times since 1987 to ensure that every vote for the Nationalist Party and the Labor Party is given a higher weighting than votes received by any of the country’s other political parties when it comes to translating votes into parliamentary seats.
For starters, there are more bailouts to come, with Portugal at the top of the list.
It is very difficult for a central government to sit on the sidelines when the economy’s key players are on the brink of collapse.
That is nonsense.
By nationalizing private debts, Europe is following the path of the 1980’s debt crisis in Latin America.
It is worth pausing to commemorate this remarkable event, and the effect the euro’s existence has had on the current global crisis. 
And pricing of goods and labor throughout the currency area, which previously had different exchange rates, becomes much more transparent.
This partially cushions the downturn.
Low inflation, no currency risk, decreased transaction costs, and greater transparency have made the euro a success.
Indeed, avoiding continuous competitive devaluations is more a blessing than a curse.
But that is completely at odds with the historical record: the era of the gold standard is replete with boom-bust episodes fueled by over-borrowing by governments, firms, individuals, or all of the above.
European banks could bulk up in large part because it was assumed that their respective governments backed them.
If exchange rates cannot depreciate, wages and prices need to fall when a country has an unsustainable current-account deficit.
But this is not about Greece any longer.
There is a lot of shouting in the jury room. Expect a verdict soon.
Many battles were fought in the last three years – over Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Italy, to name the main ones.
Moreover, Merkel visited Athens and silenced the voices in her coalition government who were openly calling for Greece’s exit from the euro.
Banking union is a positive development, but there is no agreement on additional reforms, such as the creation of a common fiscal capacity or a common treasury.
So, in practical terms, the difference between reforms that could be implemented and those that are being or will be implemented is less significant than it seems.
Europe’s democratic deficit is less a gap between European institutions and European citizens than between national politics and European problems.
At the same time, because the EU is both a source of wealth creation, through market integration, and of redistributive effects among states, through competition in that market, its decisions’ increasingly majoritarian character requires some democratic notion of distributive fairness. To the extent that European issues can’t still be fully governed by European politics, national politics need to be made more European.
Any new VAT resource should be linked to cross-border transactions, establishing a clear link with the internal market.
It is obvious that politicians and bankers made grave errors that contributed to the current crisis.
The dream of European unity evidently induced some to remain silent in an effort to preserve the euro project’s visionary goodwill.
The Euro’s Imagined Community
So, it is not alarmist to worry aloud about preserving the sense of community that Europe has enjoyed for the past half-century.
The new narrative was reinforced with physical symbols, akin to a currency or a flag, in the form of belts of beads made of wampum, the Iroquois’ money.
Every currency union chooses symbols of common cultural values for its coins and notes, and these symbols become part of the sense of shared identity.
The point is that if Europe can keep these symbols alive, even a eurozone breakup would not have the dire political consequences for Europe that so many predict.
Yet little was done.
Lower interest rates, for example, would free up money so that even countries with tight budget constraints could spend more on growth-enhancing investments.
The single-market principle was supposed to promote the efficient allocation of capital and labor.
If sound policies are implemented and better institutions established –&nbsp;which does not mean only more austerity and better supervision of banks, budgets, and deficits –&nbsp;and growth is restored, these countries will be able to meet their debt obligations, and there will be no need to call upon the guarantees.
No one seems to have the power to impose a sensible resolution of its peripheral countries’ debt crisis.
It will stop spreading only when Germany constructs a firm and credible firewall, presumably around Spanish and Italian central-government debt. This is exactly the kind of hardheaded solution that one would see in a truly integrated currency area.
The peripheral countries might just experience enough growth to sustain their ambitious austerity commitments.
Unfortunately, an ultra-soft IMF is the last thing Europe needs right now.
But it is hard to see how the single currency can survive much longer without a decisive move towards a far stronger fiscal union.
But – and here’s the point – with its debts written off, the banking system is now recapitalized and able to support economic growth.
The arithmetic is simply horrible.
The alternative for Greece is to manage its default in an orderly manner.
The Germans and French would need to inject new capital into their banks (perhaps finally becoming open to tighter regulation to prevent this from happening again), and the whole world would become more wary about lending to profligate sovereigns.
Under the umbrella of common deposit insurance, US savings banks made a “gamble for resurrection” – borrowing excessively from their depositors and lending the money out to risky enterprises, knowing that potential profits could be paid out as dividends to shareholders while potential losses would be socialized.
Debt-equity swaps rescue the banks without rescuing their shareholders.
Spanish banks have 7% equity capital on average on their balance sheets.
Back in the early 1990's, American officials like me who were making long-term forecasts for the Clinton administration cautioned that it would be rash to forecast an average long-run growth rate of more than 2.5% per year - and that actual growth might turn out to be even slower.
The value of the cars is calculated in American GDP, but European public-transport systems are counted not at their value to passengers but as a cost to government.
Moreover, European labor productivity figures are inflated by the fact that potential workers who would be less productive are much less likely to hold any jobs at all.
A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress.
European economic elites perceive China and India very differently.
BERLIN – Just weeks ago, the worst of the financial crisis in Europe seemed to be over. Stability seemed to be returning.
For the distressed southern European states, the German-backed mixture of austerity and structural reforms is proving fatal, because the decisive third and fourth components – debt relief and growth – are missing.
That is precisely the order of the day in Europe and the eurozone.
Europe’s national politicians routinely criticize the EU for its lack of democratic legitimacy, yet they bear part of the responsibility for it.
The eurozone, it is claimed, should have its own budget to provide similarly automatic insurance to its members.
The federal government intervenes only in the case of major nationwide recessions and provides some supplementary benefits for the long-term unemployed. But this support is given to all states and thus does not provide those most affected with much more support than the others receive.
This leads to a simple conclusion: The euro’s long-term stability depends far more on completing plans for a European banking union than it does on creating some new budget for the eurozone.
Even Germany’s temporary success is riddled with caveats.
It is why Spain and Ireland are in serious trouble, and why even Italy – which is on relatively sounder fiscal footing, but has had flat per capita income for a decade and little structural reform – cannot be complacent.
So a eurozone that needs fiscal austerity, structural reforms, and appropriate macroeconomic and financial policies is weakened politically at both the EU and national levels.
Likewise, debt buybacks would be a massive waste of official resources, as the residual value of the debt increases as it is bought, benefiting creditors far more than the sovereign debtor.
The ECB and creditor banks can live for two or three weeks with a temporary downgrade of Greece’s debt.
To revive growth, the ECB needs to stop raising interest rates and reverse course. The eurozone should also pursue a policy – partially via looser monetary policy – that weakens the value of the euro significantly and restores the periphery’s competitiveness.
Now the eurozone – with a centralized monetary policy, run by the European Central Bank, alongside 27 national fiscal policies – has come to look like a mockery of economic common sense.
A monetary union that does not benefit all of its participants will not survive for long. After the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis erupted, defaults were avoided by establishing the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism (since replaced by the European Stability Mechanism), and by crafting a more pragmatic and reinforced role for the ECB (acting with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund).
The Europe 2020 strategy, approved two years ago in part to improve economic governance, is a good starting point, offering the basis for the “growth compact” that some EU governments have sought.
Such a gulf within a monetary union cannot be sustained for very long.
The problem, however, is that a large part of this improvement reflects collapsing domestic demand, which has plummeted by around one-quarter in Greece and Ireland since 2007, and by one-eighth in Spain and Portugal.
Spain’s performance in foreign markets is especially impressive.
The problem, however, is that prices have generally proved much more rigid, declining only in Ireland.
But societies may lose patience in the meantime.
Skeptics have plenty of ammunition for their critique of the euro.
Whenever the dollar was weak, capital surged into alternative currencies, notably the Japanese yen and the German Mark.
Slovenia, which entered the eurozone in 2007, and Slovakia, which joined at the beginning of 2009 – just as the cresting financial crisis slammed shut the door to further euro enlargement – have enjoyed much greater financial stability than their untied neighbors.
European governments are not in a position to instruct the ECB to purchase government bonds.
The eurozone crisis may be entering its third stage.
Indeed, given Germany’s surprisingly impressive employment performance, another Wirtschaftswunder appeared to be in the making.
This trade multiplier is causing European economies to drag each other down, and the rest of the world is feeling the effects.
And, a mere two months later, both countries’ central banks report that even these reduced expectations are too optimistic.
NEW YORK – Since World War II’s end, the global economy’s trade and financial openness has increased, thanks to institutions like the International Monetary Fund and successive rounds of liberalization, starting with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947.
Although the shifting structure of the global economy is best described as a journey taken only once, growth in developing countries does exhibit repeating patterns.
Early high-growth economies – Japan, South Korea, Taiwan – initially exported labor-intensive products, then graduated to more capital-intensive goods like motor vehicles, and then to human-capital-intensive activities like design and technology development.
Indeed, the post-crisis shortfall in domestic demand is causing stubbornly high unemployment, even as the economy recovers some of its growth momentum.
It would be nice if there were an easy and reasonably certain way to accomplish that.
Building on that tradition, member states formed a union based on equality and not dominated by any state or nationality.
This stance led to a dramatic acceleration in European integration, culminating in the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the introduction of the euro in 1999.
When a fiscal crisis hit Greece, the financial world suddenly discovered that eurozone members had put themselves in the position of developing countries.
Economic conditions are continuing to deteriorate, causing immense human suffering.
Europe’s leaders are so preoccupied with the crisis of the day that they have no time to ponder the long-term consequences of their actions.
According to the International Society for Human Rights, 80% of all acts of religious persecution worldwide in 2012 were directed at Christians.
In early April, a funeral at St. Mark’s Cathedral (the seat of the Coptic Church in Cairo) for four Christians killed in sectarian riots days earlier descended into chaos, with thousands of mourners attacked as they tried to leave after the service.
Furthermore, fallout from relentless regional conflict is destabilizing Lebanon, a country that offers Christians a constitutional guarantee of political representation.
It is the “moderates” who must now adapt their policies.
But Assad managed to emerge from Syria’s forced withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 to become the broker without whom a Lebanese government could not be created and a president could not be elected.
They are crucial players in Lebanon, they have a role to play in pacifying Iraq, they can influence a change of attitude of powerful and extremely destabilizing non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah, and their leverage on Hamas is vital for the stability of the Palestinian front.
Ratko Mladic, in combat fatigues, stocky, walking as though through a muddy field; and Radovan Karadzic, taller, wearing a suit, with his wild, but carefully coiffed, shock of white hair.
We had anticipated this moment and agreed in advance that, while we would never ask to meet with Karadzic and Mladic, if Milosevic offered such a meeting, we would accept – but only once, and only under strict guidelines that would require Milosevic to be responsible for their behavior.
When he heard our demand that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately, he exploded.
But while the Dayton agreement gave NATO the authority to capture Karadzic and Mladic, an arrest didn’t occur for nearly 13 years.
Even though almost 13 years is an inexcusably long time, the war crimes indictment kept Karadzic on the run and prevented him from resurfacing.
Attacking a communist country has always seemed to offer American politicians a convenient way to appeal to the average voter.
Moreover, China's geopolitical importance to the US has grown immensely since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. of September 11, 2001.
New York – The World’s central bankers are a close-knit club, given to fads and fashions.
By contrast, US inflation stands at 3%. Does that mean that these developing countries should raise their interest rates far more than the US?
So, what should be done? First, politicians, or central bankers, should not be blamed for imported inflation, just as we should not give them credit for low inflation when the global environment is benign.
But most developing countries do not have the institutional structures, or the resources, to do likewise.
Maybe the collapse stems from lousy internal controls in financial firms that, swaddled by implicit government guarantees, lavish their employees with enormous rewards for risky behavior.
And if the decline in nominal wages signals that there is an excess supply of labor, matters only get worse.
It is easy to see why.
He made the right choice before the Iraq war - America's intervention was never justified and has yielded a terrible failure - and so found himself in sync with an emerging European, even global, opposition to the Bush administration.
Maintaining France's weight within the European Union should have led Chirac to re-confirm Lamy when José Manuel Barroso took over as President of the Commission.
These biases matter because they do not jibe with the enlarged Europe of today.
Of course, this decline must not be overestimated.
I wish France could adopt a more humble attitude, show more respect for its partners and the EU's institutions, and view Europe as more than an extension of its own philosophy.
The war in Lebanon, so frustrating for Israel, accelerated that subtle change. Now Europe and its various contingents are playing a leading role in picking up the pieces there.
All these developments subtly indicate a deep trend that can be formalized in one sentence: America’s unipolar moment, which began in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Empire, is over.
The world in which we live may be moving toward the multi-polarity wished for by French President Jacques Chirac, but not necessarily in a successful and stable way.
Europe has a unique chance to demonstrate that it can make a difference in America’s post-unipolar moment.
The real reason to worry is that India has lost international competitiveness and has been buying time by borrowing from fickle lenders.
Infrastructure did not keep pace with the economy’s needs.
Amid weakening competitiveness, the rupee was propped up by increasingly unstable foreign sources of funds.
And the Indian government played a large part in fueling rupee appreciation by easing companies’ ability to borrow abroad.
To reclaim its promise, India must foster a new generation of productivity growth.
Moreover, they knew that, in contrast to the inter-war period, close international coordination would be needed.
The fact that many Western economies got out of recession last year should not fool us into thinking that the crisis was only a brief interlude, and that the post-crisis world can return to the pre-crisis status quo.
By doling out vast sums of money to rescue the financial system, without asking for genuine guarantees in return, they showed a lack of foresight.
After all, export-led growth policies can succeed only if other countries are willing to run deficits.
As long as the system is corrupted from above, and as long as the only way common people can deal with the government is through bribery, says the report, inefficiency will reign and people will cheat each other.
He was afraid, he explained, that if he appointed new people they would start over in their depredations, putting a much heavier burden on Egypt.
The report maintains that these funds are often used to participate in illegal financial transactions, arms’ dealing, and money laundering.
The need for reform, it argues, is not based merely on a desire for better government or abstract rights, but is necessary to save a country that is being strangled.
But, while this seems more responsive than “no comment,” it says little about the course of current and future US government action.
Even with the dollar’s decline and the resulting 25% rise in US exports over the past two years, the US still had an annualized trade deficit at the end of fourth quarter of 2007 of about $700 billion (5% of GDP).
But when foreign investors don’t want to continue to hold dollar securities, their attempts to sell them will push down their value until the combination of reduced exposure and reduced fear of further dollar decline makes them willing to hold the outstanding stock of dollar securities.
Yet a new survey shows that Americans believe that the share of renewables in 2035 will be 30.2%.
The reality is that humanity has spent recent centuries getting away from renewables.
And there is one environmental benefit that is often overlooked: in 1910, more than 30% of farmland in the United States was used to produce fodder for horses and mules.
Yes, Denmark gets a record 34% of its electricity from wind. But electricity accounts for only 18% of its final energy use.
In the US, renewables accounted for 9.3% of energy production in 1949.
But if renewables were cheaper, they wouldn’t need subsidies, and we wouldn’t need climate policies.
Instead of believing in the Tooth Fairy, we should start investing in green R&D.
Consider the International Monetary Fund’s regular projections of world growth.
Faith in renewed growth is an ill-advised policy strategy.
Resumption of robust world economic growth is the basis for delaying the implementation of the Basel III bank rules.
AMSTERDAM – Competitiveness has become one of the economic buzzwords of our time.
Evergreen’s management cited the much higher government support available in China as its reason for the move.
A recent study by the Central Planning Bureau in the Netherlands shows that workers with a permanent contract receive more employer-funded training than workers with a temporary contract.
This has come at the expense of sectors that are more dependent on equity financing.
The freeze on $25 million of the leadership’s assets held at Banco Delta Asia in Macau has certainly irritated the North Koreans.
The Chinese can’t force Kim to disarm fully, but they can persuade him to negotiate with a now more flexible US.
It would also designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and impose further limits on exports to the country’s civil aviation industry.
Sanctions give lawmakers and diplomats plenty to talk about.
But at least it doesn’t tax poor countries, as rich-country imperialists did until well into the twentieth century.
As all but the most belligerent critics of US President George W Bush will acknowledge, America has taken an important lead in trying to make things marginally better.
In short, the fundamental problem with the debt-relief mantra is that it looks backward rather than forward.
It costs too much; it is inconvenient; and its environmental benefits are negligible (and, in some cases, non-existent).
No one should be surprised.
Moreover, the electricity required to charge an electric car is overwhelmingly produced with fossil fuels. Yes, it then emits about half the CO2 of a conventional car for every kilometer driven (using European electricity).
Purchasing a similar amount in the European Emissions Trading System would cost about €5.
Electric cars might be a great advance for that purpose in a couple of decades.
Private capital flows have exploded since, dwarfing trade in goods and services.
In fact, many emerging markets experienced declines in investment rates. Nor, on balance, has liberalization of capital flows stabilized consumption.
Behind this shortcoming lay various institutional and market distortions associated with industrial and other modern-sector activities in low-income environments.
But it is not impossible – as long as policymakers understand the critical role played by the exchange rate and the need to subordinate capital flows to the requirements of competitiveness.
Yes, over the last decade, there has been growing use of global governance standards, largely developed in the United States, to assess how countries and companies around the world protect minority investors. But these efforts have overlooked fundamental differences between controlled companies, which have a controlling shareholder, and widely held firms that lack such a controller.
Investors and public officials in countries where controlled companies dominate should stop using global governance standards based on the designers’ experience with widely held firms in the US.
They should focus on the special problems of controlled companies and on the rules that would work best for protecting smaller investors in such companies.
Deploying more wind turbines and solar panels creates a need for more builders, technicians, tradespeople, and specialist employees.
But the biggest problem in these analyses is that they often fail to recognize the higher costs or job losses that these policies will cause.
In addition to job creation, some researchers have blithely claimed that all sorts of other economic benefits will accrue from investment in alternative energy, including increased productivity, higher disposable incomes, and lower operating costs for businesses.
These programs were fine, the argument goes, for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation, but they have become obsolete in today’s high-tech, networked, post-industrial economy.
One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own long-run fragility than they were in the post-World War II decades.
Workers and other asset holders place a very high value on safety, security, and predictability, so a defined-benefit pension plan is extremely valuable.
The reality is far more complex, of course.
Others around the world similarly oppose regulatory institutions, but for very different reasons.
Day-to-day politics cannot dominate the regulation that markets need.
SOFIA – One of the most troubling outcomes of the ongoing financial crisis has been a collapse of trust in democratic institutions and politicians.
On the contrary, as soon as government information is designed to be immediately open to everybody, its value as information declines and its value as an instrument of manipulation increases.
Moreover, information never comes without interpretation.
But, in a regime like Vladimir Putin’s, where the government decides who may be a candidate, the webcams would be farcical were they not also so intimidating.
Rather than restoring trust in democratic institutions, the transparency movement could accelerate the transformation of democratic politics into the management of mistrust.
For the last 12 years, the Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by 2015 has been the driving force for hunger reduction.
Indeed, the FAO was created in 1945 to bring about a world in which there would be “freedom from want,” which, in the words of its founders, “means the conquest of hunger and the attainment of the ordinary needs of a decent, self-respecting life.”
The Fatal Myth of a Drug-Free World
But there is reason for hope.
A Death in Galway
Halappanavar died from septicemia, which her family is certain would not have developed if the termination had been carried out.
As I noted almost 20 years ago, the Western Christian/Catholic view of abortion is not the only religious interpretation of the issue.
Such a global dialogue initiated in “the East” would not be unique.
Ethnocentrism is bound to distort a people’s relations with the rest of the world, and Israel’s doctrine of power was drawn from the depths of Jewish experience, particularly the eternal, unforgiving hostility of a Gentile world.
Israel’s lightning victory &#160;recalls Hegel’s dictum about “the impotence of the winners.”
In fact, Israel materialized because historical and political conditions favored it, and because Zionist diplomacy successfully navigated the international-relations challenges that it encountered.
Indeed, international acquiescence to the situation created by Israel’s victory in 1967 proved to be extremely short-lived.
In such circumstances, seemingly small events can trigger an unforeseen and disastrous chain reaction. 
America is clearly concerned.
But, given the danger of incidents that could grow out of political competition in Taiwan or growing impatience in the Peoples’ Liberation Army on the mainland, the US would be wise to encourage more active contacts and negotiations by the two sides.
If the overall climate is one of distrust, what looks like a hedge to one side can look like a threat to the other.
While some are supporting additional stimulus, others are calling for UK-style austerity.
I am heartened by calls for this in the UK, and that the talk is now turning to the purchase of risky assets, such as corporate bonds or bundles of loans to the private sector, as opposed to long-term government securities.
The 2008 recession was triggered by the collapse of a real-estate bubble.
Quantitative easing works by increasing the value of wealth.
Men report handling of their testicles and penises, TSA officials are instructed to open and peer down waistbands, and YouTube is now rife with videos of frightened children being – to describe it accurately – sexually molested, though this is the last thing most TSA officials wish to do.
And children will be placed most at risk of profound negative effects.
Shortly after former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff made the rounds of TV shows arguing in favor of such measures to thwart “bad guys,” one of his consulting firm’s clients, Rapiscan, won the $350 million contract to provide the full-body x-ray machines.
Maintaining these profits requires a population conditioned by this theater of fear to submit to anything – even the sexual quasi-abuse of themselves and their children.
Fear of terrorism is only one segment of what might best be described as a multi-level structure of dread.
In the aftermath of World War II, a group of idealistic Frenchmen bent on reconciliation with their former enemy declared that France would have “the Germany she deserved.”
The Fed vs. the Financiers
Greenspan listened patiently and quietly to Bernanke’s logic.
The problem is worse in most other countries.
But then he sheepishly adds that if his wife is not happy, he cannot be happy.
Bernanke had also supported the low-interest-rate policy implemented after the dot-com collapse, which, in the view of many economists, was maintained for too long, fueling the boom and contributing to the bust.
Politicians acknowledge, in their more rational moments (yes, they have them), that they can’t be trusted with the interest-rate weapon, especially as an election approaches.
The problem is how to establish two different types of accountability for two different functions.
President Obama should not draw the conclusion that arguments about the Fed’s accountability have gone away with Bernanke’s confirmation.
Even the periphery of the eurozone is benefiting from the wall of liquidity unleashed by the Fed, the Bank of Japan, and other major central banks.
The weak real economy and job market, together with high debt ratios, suggest the need to exit monetary stimulus slowly.
The exit from the Fed’s QE and zero-interest-rate policies will be treacherous: Exiting too fast will crash the real economy, while exiting too slowly will first create a huge bubble and then crash the financial system.
And, having played a central role in creating the current mess, it is now trying to regain face.&nbsp;
So, while bringing down short-term T-bill rates to near zero has failed, the hope is that bringing down longer-term interest rates will spur the economy.
It may help, though, in two ways.
So QE would produce some – probably weak – balance-sheet effects.
Today, many social conservatives still blame Friedan and feminism for inducing women to abandon the home for the workplace, thus destabilizing families and placing their children at risk.
The dramatic decrease in laws and customs perpetuating female subordination over the past 40 years has been closely connected to women’s expanded participation in paid employment.
In countries such as Japan, Italy, and Singapore, where the terms of marriage remain favorable to men, and women have a hard time combining work and family, working women postpone marriage and motherhood much longer than in the US, leading to declines in birth rates that threaten these societies’ future.
Far from being a threat to family life, the further progress of women’s rights may be our best hope for well-functioning families.
For example, recent data show that even a moderate deficiency of Vitamin A results in higher mortality.
Fighting malnutrition is the first step toward reaching this objective.
Despite a clear win for the center-right, the Christian Democrats (CDU) did not escape unscathed.
Merkel barely avoided political oblivion in the last general election, after the CDU had embraced market radicalism and then campaigned on it in 2005.
That said, governing will hardly be a cinch for Merkel.
The SPD, together with the Greens, will have to take the fight to the political center, which precludes competing with the Left for fringe voters.
The reason is simple: increasingly, people across Pakistan support the army’s action.
Leaders of the religious parties rushed to denounce Mohammad’s views.
In Pakistan, the democratic transition, after years of military rule, is still not complete.
Talibanization gains ground when people lose faith in the capacity of the modern state to improve their lives.
But, according to a recent and very convincing essay published in the magazine Foreign Affairs , a dual demographic and economic trend is taking place that will result in spectacular shifts by the middle of this century.
In a hasty and excessively provocative manner, some in the American media are starting to speak of Obama as “a second Jimmy Carter” and predict that he will serve only one term.
Europe must realize that it cannot be seen as a model for anyone if no one any longer takes it seriously as a global actor.
Non-financial companies could not get working capital, much less funding for long-term investments.
Sky-high oil and food prices added to the pain, and thus to the downturn.
Suppose that the government gives a tax cut in order to increase consumers’ take-home pay.
Moreover, concerns about the enormous US budget deficit, now running at $1.8 trillion (12% of GNP) per year, are bound to increase, not only creating enormous uncertainties in politics and financial markets, but also dimming consumer confidence as households focus their attention on potential future budget cuts and tax increases.
Doing so would add to the global recovery, improve long-term environmental sustainability, and accelerate economic development.
The facts have shown the opposite to be true.
The recent decision of Standard and Poor’s to lower Argentina’s rating is fully justified and reflects many analysts’ fear that Argentina will again default on its public debt.
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva did indeed decide to avoid the rampant populism of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, and successfully tackled inflation. But it takes more than that to become a great economic power.
Almost nobody, however, understands that today's chaos was made in Washington - deliberately, cynically, and steadfastly.
Attacks on Aristide began as soon as the Bush administration assumed office.
Hopes were high that he would deliver progress against the extraordinary poverty.
He was, without doubt, the popularly elected leader of the country - a claim that George W. Bush cannot make about himself.
It is sad to hear rampaging students on BBC and CNN saying that Aristide "lied" because he didn't improve the country's social conditions.
Health care for the poor (Medicaid) is a shared responsibility.
The US Constitution knitted together the thirteen original colonies, and its Tenth Amendment reserves to the states all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government.
There are important differences among jurisdictions.
California is an example of long-run fiscal folly meeting short-run national and global economic crisis, resulting in chaos.
Now facing another $20 billion deficit despite temporary tax hikes and spending cuts, California’s fiscal woes foreshadow those of many sub-national – or, indeed, national –governments globally. While all must first deal with the current emergency, sensible local fiscal, tax, and political reforms are vital to restore a balance of centralized and decentralized government.
Syria’s implosion, and the chaos and extremism that are likely to breed there, will threaten the entire Middle East: the stability of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia hangs in the balance.
But, if US politicians spend the next two years the way they have spent the last two – patching together temporary policy fixes while avoiding the hard issues that voters and markets expect them to face – America’s voice will grow fainter, and weaker, in international institutions and affairs.
NATO allies could make a similar statement.
Moreover, UN analysts estimate that most of the additional troops will not arrive in Darfur until early next year.
Their preferred model calls for the UN to provide the funding and most other support for the mission, while allowing the AU to maintain its leadership role.
The UN Human Rights Committee has found that widespread and systematic human rights abuses extend throughout Sudan, not just Darfur. Foreign Policy magazine considers Sudan the country most at risk of state failure.
We have seen this principle in action since the early fall of 2007, as growing excess demand for safe, liquid, high-quality financial assets has carried with it growing excess supply for the goods and services that are the products of ongoing human labor.
When there is excess demand for safe, liquid, high-quality financial assets, the rule for which economic policy to pursue – if, that is, you want to avoid a deeper depression – has been well-established since 1825.
How much should they do? As long as there is a clear global excess supply of goods and services – as long as unemployment remains highly elevated and inflation rates are falling – they are not doing enough.
This is no ordinary academic debate. The controversy has spilled out of the psychology laboratories and psychiatric clinics, capturing headlines, motivating legislative changes, and affecting outcomes in civil lawsuits and criminal trials.
Ordinary forgetfulness that emerges after a trauma must not be confused with amnesia for the trauma.
In contrast, the phenomenon of dissociative amnesia supposedly entails victims’ inability to remember their traumatic experiences, not an inability to remember their entire lives or who they are.
Failing to understand what had happened to them, they simply did not think about it for many years.
Pakistan was created by the partition of British India in 1947, but its territory was divided into two enclaves separated by hundreds of miles.
This was not palatable to the Punjabi-dominated military brass or to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the leader of West Pakistan’s largest political party.
Time magazine’s August 2, 1971, issue quoted a United States official saying, “This is the most incredible, calculated thing since the days of the Nazis in Poland.”
He would even send the US Seventh Fleet to cow her.
It is as if the Nuremberg trials never happened after WWII.
What is even more insulting to African women is that the AU bypassed them to pick men whose commitment to democracy and human rights may be worse than that of Laurent Gbagbo, the man clinging to the Ivorian presidency despite losing the election.
I know that many would argue that the pool of well-known African women is limited to Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the former Nigerian minister of finance and current World Bank vice president, Graça Machel, the former First Lady of Mozambique and South Africa, and a few others.
A woman wouldn't have said to Gbagbo, “Step down or face war.”
We need, therefore, to revisit today’s global challenges from a Third-World perspective.
If we are to close the global gap in personal security and economic well-being, the community of nations will need to cultivate a new ethos of mutual responsibility.
Above all, those who lead us today must create a genuinely new global order in which all peoples take part – with dignity and an assurance of fairness.
The world is on a slippery slope toward nationalism and exclusion.
Most economists stress the superiority of the free-trade model and point to the power of lobbies and interest groups to explain its unpopularity in practice.
One reason that free trade defeated protectionism in Britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people’s emotions and identities, not just their rational interest in more wealth and cheap food.
Political institutions needed to catch up.
History shows that doing so is both possible and necessary.
As a result, Palestinian politics has degenerated into a naked struggle for the spoils of power.
Tragically, all this is not only about human victims, but also about the Palestinians’ political horizon.
Only a dramatic move by external powers can still save Gaza from becoming a second Mogadishu and both Palestinians and Israelis from a total war that would only breed more rage and desperation.
A contour map of economic activity in the world would show mountains of prosperity and many ravines of deprivation.
But Keynes’s Englishman was wealthy and thus exceptional.
But flattening is reversible.
While the American and Chinese economies are highly interdependent today, so, too, were Germany and Britain before 1914.
As the world’s largest economy, the US has taken the lead in promoting policies that reduce barriers. But the events described above could reverse such policies.
While the euro has not caused France’s economic problems, its politicians’ commitment to the single currency represents an insurmountable barrier to solving them.
The current election campaign is accordingly centered on France’s fiscal position.
So the budget deficit will persist, and more retrenchment will be required.
But that was possible not because of Mitterrand’s superior wiles, but rather because France had a stronger position vis à vis Germany than it does today.

Indeed, for France’s political leaders, business amounts to a zero-sum competition to capture a higher share of total value added for owners and managers, at the expense of labor.
Now, citizens are facing higher taxes and cuts to public services.
Furthermore, companies will not receive the cash until 2014-2015, owing to the complexity of France’s tax administration.
Yet, according to all public-opinion polls, close to 70% of the French support the demonstrators who are taking to the streets to block the very modest reforms introduced by President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government.
The protesters know that what they are demanding in the streets today – the maintenance of what they have – is totally unrealistic.
Indeed, Sarkozy’s personal unpopularity plays a significant role in the continuing strength of the anti-reform opposition.
In all fairness, it seems easier to explain than to understand their behavior.
To be sure, France has been severely hit by the global financial crisis and economic downturn.
France urgently needs structural reforms – and thus a strong government.
This deep pessimism militates against any public debate or reform, and exaggerates the importance of the current political crisis.
Balancing cuts in public spending in order not to endanger growth and employment requires a stable and smart government – and time.
So don’t bury France just yet.
In some cases, grid expansion makes sense after removing these distortions.
The monthly leasing cost of the 20-watt panel in question, when stretched over 10 years, can be as little as $1.60.
Governments can choose household-level technologies or village-level micro-grids; involve aid donors or use other modes of financing; offer subsidies to encourage private entrepreneurs or energy-service concessions to existing utilities; lease the equipment by providing consumer credit or sell it up front.
The first is safety; the second is radiation.
Indeed, nuclear energy is a safer proposition now than ever before, but, for many people, the mere spectacle of an event like Fukushima – regardless of the outcome – is sufficient to draw the opposite conclusion. If a 747 crashed into a nuclear facility, we would be unlikely to hear calls for all airplanes to be outlawed, but the clamor for every reactor on the planet to be shut down immediately would probably be deafening.
Currently, there is too much “I know” and “This is what I firmly believe,” frequently from influential people, in cases where there is no incontestable right or wrong. Fukushima is one of them.
But Europe’s track record does not inspire confidence that the next round of tests will be much more rigorous than the last.
First, the new bonds could be structured so that haircuts incurred by the banks count as tax losses, reducing the hit to their profits.
The equivalent for Greece would be to index payments to its rate of GDP growth, thereby automatically adjusting Greece’s debt burden to its payment capacity.
Nor does it matter that Chávez’s handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, has already assumed the presidency. All of the signs point to the decline of Chávismo and to the end of Venezuela’s role as Latin America’s populist core.
Moreover, it will not be easy for Cuba to find a new leader to champion its absolutist ideology across Latin America.
Given this, Maduro cannot leave any issues unacknowledged or blame them on his predecessor. At the same time, it will be difficult to address Venezuela’s problems effectively without Chávez’s electoral support, rhetorical talent, and charisma.
The report is the result of a longstanding China-World Bank partnership.
Finally, farmers’ rights need to be protected, the efficiency of land use must be increased, and policies for acquisition of rural land for urban use should be overhauled.
Last but not least, China should become a proactive stakeholder in the global economy.
They seem condemned by their heavy debt burdens to years of stagnation or slow growth, widening inequality, and possible social strife.
The decade preceding the global financial crisis was in many ways the best ever for the developing world.
Even unambiguously successful cases have been subject to conflicting interpretations.
Growth that relies on capital inflows or commodity booms tends to be short-lived.
The Future of Europe

And now the recent financial crisis has exposed the limits of fiscal integration in the eurozone and raised questions about the role and future of the euro.

All who admire the European experiment must hope that they succeed.
Was his claim that revenues had grown for the last five years true merely because of acquisitions that his company had made?
In other words, Russians looked only for the agenda, the motivation behind the assertion. The actual truth was irrelevant.
Why is this politician saying nice things about that politician? What company does the product reviewer work for?
WARWICK – The just-concluded French presidential election seemed to suggest that the old left-right divisions are as potent as they have ever been – and certainly in their birthplace.
The precautionary principle is the better known of the two, and increasingly figures in environmental and health legislation.
A precautionary firm would look like a miniature version of today’s regulatory state, whereas a proactionary state would operate like a venture capitalist writ large.
In the future, I suggest, the traditionalists and the communitarians will form the precautionary pole of the political spectrum, while the libertarians and technocrats will form the proactionary pole.
Consider the development of online search in the broadest terms.
The challenge of course, is that each kind of product has a different structure and a different set of attributes.
Powerset, a tool for creating and defining such relationships in any sphere of interest, is broader but less deep.
Then, last month, Google acquired Metaweb and its user-generated database Freebase.
CAMBRIDGE – Global government is unlikely in the twenty-first century, but various degrees of global governance already exist.
Today, as a universal institution, the UN plays a crucial role in legitimization, crisis diplomacy, peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions, but its very size has proven to be a disadvantage for many other functions.
But the dollar’s global pre-eminence was the crucial feature of monetary cooperation until the 1970’s.
That is why, on issues like climate change, the UN will continue to play a role, but more intensive negotiations are likely to occur in smaller groups such as the Major Economies Forum, where fewer than a dozen countries account for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions.
CAMBRIDGE – American economic policy aims for a dollar that is strong at home and competitive abroad.
In recent years, countries around the world have accumulated very large volumes of foreign exchange, topped by China with more than $2 trillion, but including hundreds of billions of dollars held by Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, India, and the oil-producing countries.
The major risk to the sustained role of the dollar is the large and growing US national debt.
The best protection of the dollar’s future role – and of the health of the US economy – will be policies that reduce the growth of the national debt.
Even if Japan implemented them, they would still not equal the capacity of the US or eliminate the asymmetry.
To be sure, measured by official exchange rates, China is the world’s fourth largest economy, and it is growing at 10% annually. But China’s income per capita is only 4% that of the US.
By reinforcing their alliance, the US and Japan can hedge against uncertainty while at the same time offering China integration into global institutions as a “responsible stakeholder.”
The Rise of the Robots
Recently, automation in manufacturing has expanded even to areas where labor has been relatively cheap.
Translation, data analysis, legal research – a whole range of high-skilled jobs may wither away.
What is noticeable, though, is that structural unemployment – the unemployment that remains even after economies have recovered – has been on an upward trend over the last 25 years.
With our post-machine standard of living, we can afford to shed some of the Puritan guilt that has, for centuries, kept our noses to the grindstone.
The G-20’s Empty Promises
That will be particularly challenging for Bernanke.
Such large fiscal deficits would mean that the government must borrow funds that would otherwise be available for private businesses to finance investment in productivity-enhancing plant and equipment.
I hope that the other G-20 leaders do a better job of reining in their budgets.
Not only was it located in one, but, in many ways, it was also dominated by them.
Even sub-Saharan Africa, the traditional laggard, is expected to grow at 5% in 2010.
Their answer was straightforward: the crisis began with US over-borrowing, so it is America’s responsibility, not theirs, to clean up the mess.
The G-20 rightly decided to focus on those areas of the global development agenda where the major economies have a comparative advantage: financing of infrastructure such as roads and power; business development; and support for agricultural upgrading in the poorer countries.
By channeling the savings of China, Germany, Japan, and other surplus countries into infrastructure investments in the poor countries, the world’s economies truly would be working in harmony.
Soon after this, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced “years of pain ahead,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel outlined a $100bn retrenchment plan, and French Prime Minister François Fillon a similar $80bn plan. .
More importantly, increasingly nervous bond markets will at some point start questioning the sustainability of US public finances.
Four consequences are likely.
The Millennium Development Goals are the world’s agreed goals to cut poverty, hunger, and disease.
The point was clear.
It shows the nature of discussions at the highest reaches of the G-8.
Moreover, unlike in 2005, the G-8 needs to present a plan of action.
Fortunately, what needs to be done is not complicated.
In the past, top North Korean leaders tended to calculate carefully the costs and benefits when they acted to put pressure on the outside world.
They seem to believe that possession of nuclear weapons provides them with far wider room for strategic and tactical boldness.
But, compared to the more fundamental factors discussed above, I believe that this is probably a secondary motive for the attack on the Cheonan.
So far, the international community has focused mainly on the immediate concern of denuclearizing North Korea.
Since then, their membership has multiplied.
Part of the problem lies in how Central American governments confront the phenomena.
Instead of articulating policies to return fundamental rights to the region’s young people, Central American governments are preparing to wage war against gangs in the name of national security.
But the outlook for a new, sensible policy is not promising.
This is much of what passes for industry in Gaza.
Hamas won the 2006 elections in the whole of occupied Palestine and formed a national unity government with Fatah.
Most of that has been stamped out.
But the Gaza blockade means that Israel boycotts Palestinian academic life.
The Gazpromization of European Energy Security
Indeed, the Putin administration established a track record of bending rules and bullying foreign investors, with the support of prosecutors, tax authorities, regulatory agencies, and courts.
In exchange for gas deals with rival suppliers, such as Algeria, Russia has offered vast concessions on arms and preferential debt terms.
The lights must not go out across Europe.
Moreover, fundamental threats to the food and water supply – especially food in the tropics and water in the subtropics – are coming if we continue business as usual.
One, carbon dioxide reduction (CDR), involves removing from the atmosphere the main gas that is causing global warming.
What if Russia and Canada wanted Earth to be warmer, and sinking islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific want it to be cooler?
The Geopolitical Consequences of the Financial Crisis

In a financial system that has become so demented, only institutions with more or less infinite resources can stem the tide.  Such institutions can conceivably be self-help organizations, such as pools of powerful banks.  The US Treasury indeed tried to put together such a pool on Sunday, September 14th. 

Of course, the Western powers must be applauded for their efforts, with the support of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to prevent a slaughter of Libya’s civilian population.
The rise of authoritarian capitalism – best symbolized by China, but also embraced by countries as disparate as Malaysia, Singapore, Kazakhstan, and Qatar – has created a new model that competes with (and challenges) liberal democracy.
In response to calls by some overseas Chinese for people to gather on Sundays at specific sites in Shanghai and Beijing to help launch a molihua (jasmine) revolution, China has revealed a new strategy: preemptively flood the protest-designated squares with police to leave no room for protesters.
But Barack Obama’s administration apparently has concluded that Arab monarchs are likely to survive, whereas Arab presidents are more likely to fall, and that it is acceptable for the United States to continue to coddle tyrannical kings.
And, in fact, real war has actually broken out over football.
France and Germany will soon have a common army – they already have a common currency – yet the survival of national teams channels, within a strictly limited framework, lingering rivalry between the two countries.
Perhaps one day it will take place.
But I want France to avenge its defeat at the last World Cup in Seville, not its defeat at Verdun.

Using monthly Sampamp;P Composite data, the 38% increase from March to September was the second-largest six-month increase since 1871, surpassed only by a 71% increase from February to August 1933, during the Great Depression. This rebound is all the more remarkable given that it followed the second-largest six-month decrease ever, as stock prices fell 38% from September 2008 to March 2009.
Anger at these profits and bonuses only tends to increase the contagion of the story.
The clamor by disaffected politicians and human rights activists for such a conference had reached a crescendo.
But the most powerful push for the conference came from politicians in the largely Christian south, apprehensive that power would return to the Muslim north in 2007 after Obasanjo, himself a southern Christian, completed his second term.
There will be 400 delegates, but the bulk of them nominated by the president and his party, and the government-controlled National Assembly will vet their proposals.
The death of General Augusto Pinochet, Chile’s former military dictator, provides perhaps an appropriate end for a year that saw the Latin American left return to glory, a revival that Hugo Chavez’s overwhelming reelection in Venezuela is but the strongest sign.
His only ideology nowadays is Daniel Ortega.
The Latin American left does not share George W. Bush’s view of the world.
If the new left does not manage to answer these questions satisfactorily, it will be seen as having failed.
The Ghosts of Summits Past
Monetary experts argued that an agreement on currency stabilization would be highly desirable, but that it required a prior agreement on the dismantling of trade barriers – all the high tariffs and quotas that had been introduced in the course of the depression.
Germany’s president had just appointed Adolf Hitler’s radical and aggressive government.
Everyone pretended to be shocked at the failure of internationalism. But, at the same time, they were delighted to have found someone who could be blamed for the failure of the conference.
Failure at today’s London conference is also likely to be used as a rhetorical weapon against the large Western governments, and to provide a rationale for implementing new forms of state capitalism.
The secular establishment argues that the AKP’s moderation thus far reflects the checks and balances implied by secularist control of the presidency.
Now opponents of Turkey’s EU accession bid have seized upon recent events to argue that the country does not meet the democratic standards necessary for full membership.
But Turkey has the potential to show the shallowness of such a scenario by demonstrating the compatibility of liberal democracy and Islam.
The decision came only three months after the company abandoned investment in two new units in North Carolina.
But, since the March 2011 triple-meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant, the pace of the decline has accelerated significantly.
Whether the other projects, all of which have been initiated in the past five years, are on schedule remains to be seen.
As a result, the price per installed solar kilowatt has dropped by three-quarters over the last seven years.
After all, no economy can raise living standards forever through innovations that make production of existing goods more efficient.
Virtually all the toys and shoes sold in the US are made in the Far East. China alone accounts for 86% of the US bicycle market.
Moreover, exports to low-wage countries cannot compensate for job losses.
Standard supply-side arguments fare no better.
But if this capacity is impaired, neither the low road of protection nor the high road of free trade can do much good.
In addition to explicit protectionist measures, governments now plan actions that will affect others across the globe.
First, the frequency of meetings should be increased, especially in times of crisis, and the level of a few of these meetings enhanced.
Industrial countries should be happy that developing countries would take greater responsibility for global economic outcomes, rather than simply sulking about their lack of voice and representation.
In the banking world as a whole, expected write-offs now considerably exceed the €400 billion mark projected just last spring.
This has dispelled hopes that Asia economic activity could develop separately from that of the US, thereby offsetting European exporters’ losses in America.
In the second quarter, the German economy shrank at an annualized, seasonally and calendar adjusted rate of 2%.

So it is no surprise that central banks have become increasingly desperate in the face of the most severe crisis since the advent of financial globalization.
To mitigate the effects of a US recession and global economic slump, the Fed and other central banks should be cutting rates much more aggressively, rather than relying on modest liquidity injections that are bound to fail. The Fed’s 25-basis-point cut in December was puny relative to what is needed; similar cuts by the Bank of England and Bank of Canada do not even begin to address the increase in nominal and real borrowing rates that the sharp rise in Libor rates has induced.
So the risk of something equivalent to a bank run for non-bank financial institutions, owing to their short-term liabilities and longer-term and illiquid assets, is rising – as recent runs on some banks (Northern Rock), money market funds, state investment funds, distressed hedge funds suggests.
But fiscal austerity will envelop most advanced economies this year, rather than just the eurozone periphery and the United Kingdom.
Second, while the ECB’s actions have reduced tail risks in the eurozone – a Greek exit and/or loss of market access for Italy and Spain – the monetary union’s fundamental problems have not been resolved.
Their “state capitalism” – a large role for state-owned companies; an even larger role for state-owned banks; resource nationalism; import-substitution industrialization; and financial protectionism and controls on foreign direct investment – is the heart of the problem.
As 2013 begins, the downside risks to the global economy are gathering force.
The US budget deficit has been on a downward trend for now, helped by both higher revenues and lower pressure on spending (for example, payments to the unemployed have fallen as joblessness has declined).
Pushed further away from best-case scenarios, they are unable to ignore the global liquidity impact of the Fed’s policies, yet they lack the right policy tools to address it.
The other road is a lot less attractive. With insufficient endogenous healing and no economic escape velocity, the effectiveness of central banks’ policies wanes and political dysfunction increases, leading to financial losses, volatility spikes, and huge risk-management challenges.
Homes are the most local of investments, rooted to a particular place like a tree, and thus thriving or withering in response to local economic conditions.
People in Tokyo will assume some of this risk by purchasing New York home price futures if the price is right.
After the CME’s announcement, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said that it plans to create futures and options contracts on major US regions, to be based on the median home price published by the National Association of Realtors.
In fact, such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur when we actually see the futures market prices.
They were also revolutions of ideas – the globalization of protest as a strategy.
As Spain’s indignados sat in the squares, they felt for the first time connected to the people in their communities – a feeling that became a large part of why they stayed.
The immediate political results of this new connectivity are tenuous.
Yet his proposals are meeting strong opposition from fiscally conservative Democrats as well as from Republicans, owing to their potential impact on future fiscal deficits.
But, rather than producing a specific proposal, he left it to Congress to design the legislation.
Increasing the number of insured by 35 million and broadening protection for some who are now insured implies increased demand for health care, which could raise the cost of care paid for by the government as well as by private health-care buyers.
Surprisingly, the bond market still seems almost oblivious to this risk.
More specifically, the rising unemployment rate, along with the large number of employees on involuntary part-time work, has increased the number of people who cannot afford their monthly mortgage payments.
The rate of decline of US house prices fell in the past three months for which we have data (ending in May), and the figures for May show essentially no decline at all.
Foreclosed property is generally sold at auction, guaranteeing that there will be a buyer – but driving down prices.
Unless house prices have stopped declining, it is important for the Obama administration to turn to the problem of high loan-to-value ratios.
Amidst a crumbling economy, the country remains belligerent, using its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, to launch at least one successful drone flight above Israel and reportedly initiating recent cyber attacks.
Whereas extraction of America’s extensive reserves of natural gas was previously thought to be unfeasible, technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) have ushered in a shale-gas revolution.
Though nationalist sentiment directed against external foes tends to divert attention temporarily from internal turmoil, the country’s serious domestic problems need to be addressed.
The Kremlin continues to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, maintaining a strict aversion to military intervention and seeking to defend its strategic interests, including its naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus.
MELBOURNE – One spring evening in 1997, when I was a mental-health researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra, I was discussing with my wife, Betty Kitchener, a registered nurse who taught first-aid courses for the Red Cross in her spare time, the inadequacy of conventional first-aid training.
By 2005, it was operating across Australia and in Scotland and Hong Kong, and has since spread to more than 20 other countries.
This need is particularly pressing for those – such as parents, teachers, youth workers, and sports coaches – who are in regular contact with young people.
In developed and developing countries alike, the scope of the problem is too large to be left exclusively to mental-health professionals.
The US remains the global leader in R&amp;D investment, spending an estimated $400 billion in 2009 – a total boosted by President Barack Obama’s stimulus package, and higher than China, Japan, and Germany combined.
Throughout the world, the business sector remains both the predominant performer and the predominant funder of R&amp;D investment.
Many countries are also changing their immigration laws to make it easier to attract highly skilled workers, especially scientists and engineers, who are increasingly mobile.
The common currency is the canary in the mine of the global exchange-rate system.
When things did not work out globally, a regional solution might be possible.
What resulted was a partly flawed answer to the problem.
It will demand global coordination of monetary policies, and some form of global economic governance.
And, just as the inhuman terror attacks of September 11, 2001 severely damaged Islam’s credibility in many people’s eyes, the invasion of Iraq, which was based on lies, has damaged both Christianity and the Western community of values.
This Golden Rule, however, also appears in the Indian tradition.
Four concrete ethical rules were laid down in the Buddhist canon by Patanjali, the founder of Yoga, in the Chinese tradition and, of course, in the three prophetic religions: “Do not kill,” “do not steal,” “do not bear false witness,” and “do not abuse sexuality.”
If he is all-powerful, he could have created a world without so much of it – and he would have done so if he were all good.
The seventeenth-century French philosopher René Descartes solved it by the drastic expedient of denying that animals can suffer.
Next, D’Souza argued that since God gave us life, we are not in a position to complain if our life is not perfect.
If, however, we insist on believing in divine creation, we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good.
As concerns about deflation replaced fear of inflation, gold prices started to fall with the correction in commodity prices.
Second, a massive wave of liquidity, via easy monetary policy, is chasing assets, including commodities, which may eventually stoke inflation further.
Eventually, central banks will need to exit quantitative easing and zero-interest rates, putting downward pressure on risky assets, including commodities.
CAMBRIDGE &#45;&#45; Lately, I have been trying to explain to my eleven-year-old son Gabriel the astronomical differences between people’s income.
Yes, I say. But if Bill Gates were to own the entire NBA, how would he decide which team to root for?
As for the other nine months, given that the US accounts for only 25% of world income, it is a fair guess that there are some very wealthy individuals elsewhere who might be able to kick in.
Policy solutions are not easy.
Gabriel says he is going to think about it.
Goldstone included in his report a detailed discussion of Hamas’s seizure of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and its refusal even to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to see him.
Only three have resulted in indictments.
The evidence available to him and to us about those investigations is clearly too paltry to warrant such a shift.
Signs of hope and progress abound.
Israel will not be able to ignore completely the rulings of either court.
I am also an investor in and advisor to AnchorFree, the company that offers Hotspot Shield, a publicly accessible virtual private network (VPN) that allows users to keep their browsing private, whether they are concerned about thieves stealing their banking details or about governments monitoring where they surf.
China employs approximately 30,000 people as censors.
Baidu, the indigenous Chinese rival to Google, benefits in many ways both from government support and from home-team nationalism among users.
Nor is China likely to say, “We weren’t hacking you…and we promise never to do it again.”
So someone in the Chinese government is probably having regrets.
Carnegie argued that those who thrive in business and acquire huge personal fortunes are better at judging how the world really works, and thus are better qualified to judge where resources should be directed.
Useful traits in business, like aggressiveness or political savvy, might be poorly suited to philanthropy. Likewise, running a foundation may well require studying social problems or the arts and sciences – activities that may not accord with former capitalists’ inclinations and talents.
However, 1% of GDP is still not a very big number, and the Gates Foundation, with about $60 billion after Buffett’s bequest, now accounts for a substantial share of the total.
We see two components to such a strategy.
But the magnitude of the challenges confronting Europe implies an urgent need for far more decisive reforms.
But the world expects the G-20 to deliver.
Since every dollar, euro, yen, rupee, or yuan borrowed today requires the same present value in future interest payments – and therefore future taxes – there are important long-term costs to balance against whatever benefits the deficits create today; there is no fiscal free lunch.
The current US stimulus has been much slower to enter the economy than promised.
Deficits are riskier if the level of the national debt, the accumulation of all previous deficits, is high or rapidly rising relative to GDP.
NEW HAVEN – In September 1998, during the depths of the Asian financial crisis, Alan Greenspan, the United States Federal Reserve’s chairman at the time, had a simple message: the US is not an oasis of prosperity in an otherwise struggling world.
Not surprisingly, Asia led the way, accounting for 33% of the total US export surge over the past three years.
That suggests that most of America’s European export gain was concentrated in the region’s so-called peripheral economies.
All of this underscores one of the more obvious, yet overlooked, implications of an increasingly interdependent world: we are all in it together.
America’s growth mirage is an important case in point.
But who are all those people wildly cheering for the billionaire’s dream, on of all days the anniversary of Martin Luther King’s speech? They are almost uniformly white, largely middle-aged and above, and for the most part far from wealthy.
Populism everywhere is driven by fear and resentment: fear of being powerless, without status or privilege, and resentment of those – educated liberal elites, foreigners who supposedly take our jobs, and Muslims, Jews, blacks, or illegal immigrants – who seem to enjoy undeserved benefits.
This is the myth of the US, the God-blessed land of the free.
Franklin D. Roosevelt knew how to inspire the patriotism of working men.
At one time the benevolent affections embrace merely the family, soon the circle expanding includes first a class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings of man with the animal world...
There is no sound moral reason why possession of basic rights should be limited to members of a particular species.
They display a sense of justice, resenting others who do not reciprocate a favor.
Thus, there is no European medical research currently being conducted on great apes, and one barrier to granting them some basic rights has collapsed.
NEW YORK – For the American economy – and for many other developed economies – the elephant in the room is the amount of money paid to bankers over the last five years.
In order to rescue the banking system, the Federal Reserve, for example, put interest rates at artificially low levels; as was disclosed recently, it also has provided secret loans of $1.2 trillion to banks.
But the puzzle represents an even bigger elephant.
We don’t believe that regulation is a panacea for this state of affairs.
They are right – up to a point: immediately after a normal recession, economies do, indeed, often grow much faster than usual over the ensuing twelve months.
The optimists say not to worry. Credit will soon come to everyone else as easily as it has to the banks.
But here’s the rub: financial regulation is enormously complicated, all the more so given that there must be some degree of international consistency.
But if regulation is too soft, the next monster global financial crisis could come within a decade.
PRINCETON – Whenever today’s economic crisis is discussed, analogies to the Great Depression are never far away.
First, no one has ever been able to explain satisfactorily the October 1929 market collapse in terms of a rational cause, with market participants reacting to a specific news event.
Intrinsic vulnerability made for heightened exposure to political shocks, and disputes about a Central European customs union and about war reparations was enough to topple a house of cards.
That dependence is analogous to the way in which money from emerging economies, mostly in Asia, flowed into the US in the 2000’s, when an apparent economic miracle was based on China’s willingness to lend.
According to computations by the economist Paul van den Noord, the net result of the 1937 budget was a fiscal contraction amounting to three percentage points of GDP – certainly not a trivial amount.
A particularly telling example is the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century, when a string of exhausted states defaulted on their obligations.
Indeed, central bankers and ministers were obsessed at the time by the memory of the 1930’s, and they consciously did the opposite of what their predecessors did 80 years ago.
But an undisciplined appeal to history risks becoming a confusing way to express opinions.
One of America’s last competitive cultural exports, it seems, is the post-adolescent male escape fantasy.
Nor does Japanese pop culture manufacture escape fantasies aimed at Japanese men.
To the rest of the world, those same qualities are part of his charm only so long as he stays safely up on the screen.
An editorial assistant at the New York Times, Zhao Jing, writing under the pen name Michael Anti, broke the news on his widely read Chinese-language blog.
Human rights activists in the United States are calling for legislation that would prevent American companies from engaging in business practices that help repressive regimes stifle democratic movements.
Naturally, the Chinese companies that provide most of the tools used to create and host this content have censorship built into their software, management structure, and business models.
NEW DELHI – Two “great games” currently roil South Asia.
Instead of an expansionist Russian empire confronting Imperial Britain, it is now a China hungry for land, water, and raw materials that is flexing its muscles, encroaching on Himalayan redoubts and directly challenging India.
The road, after all, is a vital link in China’s quest for direct access to the Arabian Sea.
The Great Global Bargain Hunt
Their share of “international responsibility” was revealed at the recent summit: contributions to the IMF of $43 billion by China, $10 billion by Brazil, Russia, and India, and $2 billion by South Africa.
Already, the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) has obtained a 35-year lease to operate the second pier at the port of Piraeus, one of the busiest in the world, for €3.5 billion, and has purchased a truck-loading facility and packaging center in the Piraeus suburbs.
As governments and citizens around the world become aware of the influence that China can buy with its deep pockets, is an anti-Chinese backlash inevitable? Or have some countries been so scarred by the financial crisis that they don’t care where their next meal ticket comes from?
Indeed, such major carmakers as Toyota, Honda, Daimler, General Motors, and Hyundai/Kia are deep into plans for commercial production of cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells.
As for hydrogen fuel costs, there are currently no fixed numbers, but the US target is $2-3 per kilogram by around 2018 (a kilogram of hydrogen has about the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline).
Countless laboratories are working on better, cheaper hydrogen production and storage methods, and on ways to bring down costs and boost fuel cell durability.
Angell's argument was simple: in all prolonged modern industrial wars, everybody loses.
He was, of course, right in his judgment that the only way to prevent any modern industrial war from becoming a destructive tragedy for all was to quickly conclude a ceasefire.
From the pro-consulate of Julius Caesar until 1945, there was most likely at least one army crossing or about to cross or thinking of crossing the Rhine in arms.
If so, there is a chance that the globalized economic age to which we look forward will be a more peaceful age than the twentieth century was.
This vindicated criticism by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, among others, who had already begun to argue that the Phillips curve represented merely a short-term relationship.
That prospect has already sparked renewed financial-market volatility.
Sustaining a high budget deficit over many years will lead to an unmanageable debt buildup, unless that debt is inflated away or restructured.
But if, as seems likely, such devaluations are left too late, debt restructuring might still be needed.
The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world.
With the world becoming a global stage, the media’s role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential.
He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.
The years since then have seen the fastest global average income growth rate of any generation, as well as remarkably few outbreaks of mass unemployment-causing deflation or wealth-destroying inflation.
Europe's fixed exchange rate mechanism collapsed in 1992.
One year, they might seek to control inflation, but the previous year they sought to reduce unemployment, and next year they might try to lower the government’s debt refinancing costs, and the year after that they might worry about keeping the exchange rate at whatever value their political masters prefer.
Nor do I see any evidence at all in favor of the third explanation.
The euro was created partly in order to bolster internal market efficiency and prevent currency volatility.
Companies and investors exposed to risk in Europe must assume much more volatility in interest rates within the euro zone and increasingly uneven growth and inflation prospects.
No one believes that Germany is at risk of default, but investors overlook this sort of policy shift at their own risk.
The volume of Greece’s foreign debt has been reduced by more than €100 billion ($130 billion).
To reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 70%, Greece would have to maintain an average primary surplus of 4% for the next 30 years, a level that it has temporarily achieved in only four of the last 25 years.&nbsp;
But, while private-sector losses have been minimized, at what price? Had Greece defaulted on its debt in 2010, imposing the same “haircut” on private creditors as it has imposed now, it would have reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio to a more manageable 80%.
The Green Guevara’s
Whichever man wins will face Bolivia’s seemingly intractable pair of ills: social-exclusion and poverty.
Bolivia’s track record is remarkable: the world’s first debt-for-nature swap; the world’s largest protected dry tropical forest; experimental Indian park management; a rapidly growing protected-areas system; a National Environmental Fund; a world leader in international efforts to protect the endangered vicuna; progressive forestry legislation; a national biodiversity conservation agency; and a total ban on trade in domestic species.
The Green Inquisition

In June, Hansen proclaimed that people who spread “disinformation” about global warming – CEOs, politicians, in fact anyone who doesn’t follow Hansen’s narrow definition of the “truth” – should literally be tried for crimes against humanity.
But the globe’s real problem is not a series of inconvenient facts. It is that we have blocked out sensible solutions through an alarmist panic, leading to bad policies.
Because of climate panic, our attempts to mitigate climate change have provoked an unmitigated disaster.
But, while the compromise is more than could have been hoped for at the outset, several important countries did not partake of it.
The sacrifices of the participating countries would alleviate the CO2 problem only if their restraint meant that some of the fossil resources they do not consume remain underground.
They will therefore speed up rather than reduce production, in order to avoid selling their oil when anxiety about CO2 peaks and the artificial measures of the signing countries to reduce their consumption have dampened the oil price most.
The bad news is that this is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future, and that the owners of natural resources will therefore make every attempt to extract their resources and thus pump the fossil carbon into the atmosphere before the UN finds a way out of this impasse.
But billions of dollars in tax subsidies would create plenty of new jobs in almost any sector: the point is that many less capital-intensive sectors would create many more jobs for a given investment of taxpayers’ money.
If they were, we wouldn’t need to subsidize them.
Finally, it is often claimed that high CO2 taxes and subsidies for green technology will actually do good, and again Denmark is often taken as an example. After all, it is argued, Denmark has kept its CO2 emissions flat while enjoying 70% economic growth since 1981.
NAIROBI – In just two years, the idea of a “Green Economy,” with its links to sustainable development and poverty eradication, has gone from being an interesting idea to being among the top two issues at the upcoming UN Conference on Sustainable Development, or Rio+20.
None of this has come about by chance.
Multibillion-dollar investments also flowed into new wind farms, geothermal plants, and a host of other renewable-energy technologies.
The Greening of Bush
America’s environmental movement was soon exported to Europe and elsewhere: on one hand, the pragmatic Friends of the Earth and the media-oriented organization Greenpeace , and, on the other hand, eco-fundamentalist groups like Earth First! and the Environmental Justice Movement (EJM) or lobbying groups like the World Wildlife Fund.
“Green” eco-activists, while feeling awkward about support from this quarter, nonetheless find them useful allies.
Those who disdain environmental concerns have been ousted at the polls in large numbers, companies invest huge amounts in environmental technologies, states are suing car producers for their climate-adverse policies, and the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol have long been surpassed by some states – a lesson for German and European cities and municipalities.
But the lion’s share of this industrial haze – like the growing pollution of its coastal waters – is a direct result of the rapid industrialization of the Pearl River Delta across the border in China’s Guangdong Province.
Increasingly loud complaints about deteriorating air quality have goaded Hong Kong and Guangdong into embarking on a joint program in which a series of monitoring stations now provides emissions data.
This idea is clearly feasible.
Hong Kong’s leaders to do not want to end up on that infamous list.
The city of São Paulo, which represents around one-third of Brazil’s economy, is embarking on a Green Economy strategy that ranges from transport to greener buildings.
The inherent logic offers, perhaps for the first time, a sustainable growth paradigm that is suited to developing and developed countries alike.
Already, New York City produces more CO2 emissions than all of Norway.
Traffic congestion, in particular, is not only environmentally detrimental; it also imposes substantial time and resource costs on drivers.
In all of these cities, CO2 emissions declined sharply and congestion was significantly reduced, with Singapore experiencing an immediate 45% drop in traffic.
Pick any indicator: trade relative to global GDP, capital flows relative to the global capital stock, and so forth – all are rising.
Emerging economies were immediately affected by credit tightening (including trade finance) and rapid declines in exports, leading to similar shocks there.
Asset prices shifted, and capital rushed out of emerging markets, causing credit conditions to tighten and exchange rates to fall.
Given an expanded mandate and a much larger balance sheet, the International Monetary Fund, with advance notification, could in principle reliably act to stabilize volatile international capital flows, buying time for more orderly domestic responses.
Time and experience will help – that is, so long as high volatility does not destabilize many economies in the interim.
I am relatively certain that the US will successfully manage its reorientation and realignment, but the relative weight and reach of its power will nonetheless decline in the new world of the twenty-first century, as others grow in strength and catch up.
Moreover, while there is no new regional hegemon to follow America, there are numerous contenders for the role.
And what implications does Japan’s nationalist turn – and its risky economic policy – hold for the region? Can India and China stem the deterioration in bilateral relations?
WASHINGTON, DC – In the discussion of whether America’s largest financial institutions have become too big, a sea change in opinion is underway.
I think maybe banks have gotten too complex to manage as opposed to just too big to manage.”
Big banks get a big taxpayer subsidy – in the form of downside protection for their creditors.
“I think that the real purpose and the real need that we have in this country for banks is to make loans particularly to small business and to individuals.
Those who oppose their proposed reforms are most likely insiders – people who have received payments from big banks over the past year or two.
While I share these concerns, others frequently rely on two key arguments to dismiss the fear of a run on the dollar: the dollar is a reserve currency, and it carries fewer risks than other currencies.
Even if these countries want to continue to hold a minimum core of their portfolios in a form that can be used in the traditional foreign-exchange role, most of their portfolios will respond to their perception of different currencies’ risks.
If foreign holders of dollar bonds become concerned that the unsustainability of America’s situation will lead to higher interest rates and a weaker dollar, they will want to sell dollar bonds.
A large majority of Arab youths, around 70%, say that they are most influenced by parents, family, and religion, whereas only about a third report that elite groups – writers, business leaders, community leaders, and media outlets – have any influence on their outlook on life.
The trend is often accelerated by the loss of jobs, which often leads people to abandon their professional and functional identities in favor of identities based on ethnicity, kinship, or religion.
At the heart of the crisis is a strong element of indifference.
But what is urgently needed is a strong complementary focus on job creation to preserve and foster Durkheim’s organic solidarity.
But only the Baltics have secured the sort of independence dreamed of in 1991.
The dream of empire is, indeed, the gulag that imprisons the Russian mind.
In the fifteenth century, Moscow was declared a “Third Rome,” the savior of spiritual Christianity.
What matters is selling the reserves and being rich now, not finding more for later.
The evidence in this case, as in so many others, consists of Microsoft Word documents found on a computer that belonged to Saylan’s foundation.
Yet none of the trials has yet been derailed.
A senior police commissioner who had been close to the movement and wrote an exposé about its activities was accused of collaborating with the far-left groups that he had spent much of his career pursuing; he, too, ended up in jail.
Yet Erdoğan, known for his brash style, responded with remarkable equanimity.
What has yet to be recognized is the separate, and quite disturbing, role that the Gülen movement has played in bringing Turkey to its current impasse.
It is one thing to modify the behavior of a state beyond its borders, but quite another to alter what takes place within another country’s territory.
Nor could sanctions trigger a change in government in Baghdad.
History suggests that the US ought to think twice before continuing its effort to remake Afghan society or its government.
CAMBRIDGE – China and Russia have just provided the world with sharp contrasts in the use of power.
Soft power is rarely sufficient, but it is often crucial to combine soft and hard power to have an effective “smart power” strategy.
In early August, Russia set a trap in South Ossetia, and Georgia foolishly walked into it.
Opinion polls show an improvement in its international reputation.
This spring’s presidential election in Haiti sadly re-enforced the country’s blighted reputation.
But America regarded Haiti as a threat rather than as a colleague in freedom, refusing to extend diplomatic recognition until after the outbreak of the Civil War, which finally brought an end to slavery in the US.
Urban violence spiraled.
Similarly, health conditions are horrendous, but could be improved dramatically just with immunization, de-worming, safe water, antibiotics, and anti-malaria bed nets.
Hamas won 76 of 132 seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, and can count on support from four independent deputies.
If Fatah refuses to join a coalition, Hamas may opt for a government of independents and technocrats.
For the first time, a political clock is ticking for Hamas.
Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now.
And Palestinians accepted Hamas’s view that negotiations based on the Oslo Accords could not achieve Palestinian rights and political ambitions.
It was clear before the January 2006 elections that Hamas was heading toward a victory.
Consequently, Hamas will not moderate its stance, and its victory sets back the chances of Israel-Palestinian peace for decades.
Fatah’s rule is still strong in the West Bank, but even the Gaza catastrophe is unlikely to lead it to change its ways.
Gaza is ruled by a completely hostile regime.
GAZA CITY – The resumption of direct peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis has broken 20 months of stalemate, and marked the entry of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu into this round of diplomacy.
This, in turn, puts the spotlight on ongoing security cooperation between Israel, the PA, and the United States, again undermining the PA’s claims to represent the Palestinian people.
For now, Hamas and the Palestinians of Gaza are excluded from the peace talks, which means that the negotiations will most likely not lead to an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
He is wagering his scant remaining authority on the talks’ success, and Palestinians will be counting down his days in office should he fail.
And, with that change, the fate of the Front may be changing, too.
The left has, of course, denounced this move as risking fascism.
And she has brought a fresh anti-capitalist tone to the Front’s rhetoric – always a crowd pleaser in France.
Anti-capitalist revolution was tried in half of Europe in the last century, with dire results.
It certainly did not serve homeowners who are losing their homes, workers who have lost their jobs, retirees who have seen their retirement funds vanish, or taxpayers who paid hundreds of billions to bail out the banks.
The bailout exposed deep hypocrisy all around.
Those countries, like Australia, that implemented large, well designed stimulus programs early emerged from the crisis faster.
For example, while the benefits of many of the financial-engineering innovations of recent years are hard to prove, let alone quantify, the costs associated with them – both economic and social – are apparent and enormous.
Taiwan’s former first family turned out to be a den of common thieves.
This official effort to portray native “Taiwanese” as a separate ethnic group, with scant relation to Chinese culture, was extended to language, as Chen favored using the Fujian dialect in lieu of the Mandarin spoken by 1.3 billion Chinese and taught all over the world.
But in Chen’s Taiwan, domestic squabbles took precedence over economic development.
After all, it was once widely asserted that an African-American without a political machine could not become president.
As Henry Kissinger once noted, “what is presented by foreign critics as America’s quest for domination is very frequently a response to domestic pressure groups.”
If asked whether they like their democratic system of government, 90% say yes.
The Internal Revenue Service sees no increase in tax cheating.
Whether the American political system can reform itself and cope with such problems remains to be seen.
Malaria can be brought under decisive control through bed nets, indoor spraying of insecticides, and making medicines freely available to poor people in malaria-prone villages.
Currently, an alarming number of newborns die because of infection, mothers’ failure to breastfeed during the first days, or other preventable causes.
Recent success stories have been made possible through a combination of increased spending from poor countries’ budgets, supplemented by aid from rich-country donors.
BERLIN – This April was the hottest April on record, globally, for at least 130 years, according to the worldwide temperature records maintained by NASA and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
That is surprisingly simple: there is only one source of heat coming in, and that is radiation from the sun (which is largely visible light, or what physicists call short-wave radiation). And there is only one form of heat leaving the planet, and that is radiative heat (which is invisible, or what physicists call long-wave radiation).
But shrinking snow and ice cover is itself a result of warming, so reduced reflection of solar rays is not the primary cause of warming. Rather, it is a feedback that amplifies warming.
We can calculate how much this has changed the Earth’s heat balance.
It will most likely continue to do so until we stop it by cutting CO2 emissions.
Goldman Sachs, the venerable Wall Street firm at the epicenter of financial globalization, paid more than $16 billion dollars in compensation to its 25,000 employees in 2006, and spun out another $9 billion for its shareholders – a total that is greater than the annual income of most African countries.
I should have stifled myself: Eddie, figuring he had a live one, sent the missing attachment with a note saying “We are so glad someone of your stature might be interested and, by the way, if you have any friends or colleagues who might be interested, could you please forward this email to them also?”
So pressure outside the US and Britain to put the hedge fund industry on a tighter regulatory leash is hardly surprising.
Russia’s first democratically elected leader, he was also the first Russian leader to give up power voluntarily, and constitutionally, to a successor.
Moreover, no nuclear weapons were unleashed, deliberately or accidentally, and no full-scale war of the kind that ravaged post-communist Yugoslavia broke out between Russia and any of its neighbors, although several of them were locked in internal or regional conflict in which Russia’s hand was visible.
Campaigners for democracy admired Yeltsin’s struggle against the conservatives in the politburo – especially after he was forced out of the party’s inner circle in November 1987.
At some level, he sensed that Russia’s potential could be unleashed only if the government either faced down, or bought off, the special interests – military, industrial, and agricultural – that stood in the way.
Every forecaster recognizes that the actual growth rate may be higher or lower than the number that he states.
Recent US data have clearly raised the probability that the economy will run out of steam and decline during the next 12 months.
But what will happen in the third quarter and beyond now that that program has ended?
Finally, high finance allows for portfolio diversification, so that individual investors can seek high expected returns without being forced to assume large, idiosyncratic risks of bankruptcy and poverty.
Our invested wealth can only be made to appear liquid to any one of us, and only if there is no general shift in our collective desire for liquidity.
Moreover, for Keynes, “[t]he game of professional investment is intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll...”
Fashion has been transformed by the recent emergence of retail chains that hire good designers to make throwaway clothing and accessories that are right on trend.
Boycotts of sweated college t-shirts in the United States led to fairer manufacturing practices, and boycotts of coffee and produce, led mostly by women consumers, resulted in fair-trade purchases by major supermarkets.
Their leaders make the point that, at current pay levels, workers cannot feed themselves or their families.
But it already costs too much to the women who can’t afford to feed and house themselves and their children.
But, even in narrow cost-benefit terms, it makes sense to spend more on treating depression.
In China, according to a recent article by Teh-wei Hu and colleagues in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology , depression costs 51 billion renminbi, or more than $6 billion, per year at 2002 prices.
So, while we can and should do much better at treating it, perhaps the more significant question is whether we can learn to prevent it.
Not everyone wanted to be modern, of course, and not everyone could put in place the institutions and policies necessary to make democracy and capitalism work, but no alternative system would yield better results.
But this is different from saying that there is a universal desire to live in a liberal society – that is, a political order characterized by a sphere of individual rights and the rule of law.
Democratic transitions need to be driven by societies that want democracy, and since the latter requires institutions, it is usually a fairly long and drawn out process.
Yet, for once, Bush actually hit upon a historical analogy that was true.
Instead of helping Japanese of the old school restore an authoritarian system, General Douglas MacArthur’s administration helped Japanese liberals restore and improve their prewar democratic institutions.
The same was true in the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand, and, indeed, in the Middle East, where democracy is yet to take root.
The Hollow Heart of Medical Science
Though today’s biomedical science claims to search for repairs of nature’s defects, too many of its practitioners behave as if their real purpose were only to gain the mythical immortality of precedence, at whatever cost to themselves or others.
Professors do not deserve the title unless they are willing to take the time and make the effort to openly affirm something beyond their data.
The crises that the two institutions now face in the wake of Ireland’s vote against the Lisbon Treaty and the deterioration of security in Afghanistan are of course very different.
And, without confronting much more seriously the “sanctuary” role unwillingly played by Pakistan, there is no solution ahead for NATO in Afghanistan.
One thing is certain; a “shrinking West,” as long as it retains some influence, must create the best institutions it can during the time it still has.
But, while much more needs to be done to meet the immediate needs of this famine’s victims, we should also be thinking now about long-term solutions to preclude food crises on this scale from happening in the first place.
The first focused on 225,000 of Ethiopia’s most at-risk farmers, and got them what they needed immediately: food.
New drought-tolerant maize varieties, for example, are already benefiting more than two million smallholder farmers in Africa.
Indeed, while Asia is rising, the rich industrial countries of the old G-7 have been drifting into a liquidity trap.
But the effect of a new round of QE on interest rates could be small and limited to an announcement effect, as the Fed’s own research indicates.
“It’s no use throwing dollars out of a helicopter,” as Brazilian Minister of Finance Guido Mantega put it.
The impact of the Fed’s policy and hot money has been dramatic.
And, in a world where the G-7 no longer drives global growth, printing money is playing with fire.
Similarly, the journal Science reports that new studies show that ocean levels may rise much more rapidly and precipitously than anticipated.
Unlike George W. Bush’s administration, which remains cavalier in its disregard for the warning signs of climate danger both at home and globally, Hu Jintao’s leadership has begun to evince a hopeful assertiveness, at least in domestic environmental policy.
If climate change were on the agenda for Hu’s upcoming trip, the meeting, whether or not it is designated a “state visit,” could be one of historic consequence.
We need a deal by the end of 2009 in order to institute more ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.
Harvests may halve and rivers on which irrigation and hydropower depend may become a mere trickle.
BERKELEY – At the end of 2008, as the financial crisis hit with full force, the countries of the world divided into two groups: those whose leaders decided to muddle through, and China.
Now it appears to have abandoned that claim in favor of the message that failure to cut will produce disaster.
When interest rates are low and you can borrow on favorable terms, the market is telling you to pull government spending forward into the present and push taxes back into the future.
But businesses establish lines of credit for future contingencies all the time, and they don’t think there is anything humiliating about resorting to them when those contingencies come to pass.
Perhaps more interesting is the ongoing modernization of the language in which those debates are conducted: Latin.
Technology-fueled development is causing historical eras to become cumulative, rather than linear.
At the MIT Media Lab, double-amputee Hugh Herr has pioneered “biomechatronics,” which combines biology, mechanical engineering, and electronics to invent efficient, lifelike prosthetics.
Improved technological capacity would not only help citizens to compete for jobs; it would help countries thrive in the new global environment of increasing hybridization.
But these eras have been characterized by conquest and exploitation, not peace.
On the contrary, a resurgence of right-wing economics, driven, as always, by ideology and special interests, once again threatens the global economy – or at least the economies of Europe and America, where these ideas continue to flourish.
Meanwhile, the US financial sector has been lobbying hard to free itself of regulations, so that it can return to its previous, disastrously carefree, ways.
But austerity undermines growth, worsening the government’s fiscal position, or at least yielding less improvement than austerity’s advocates promise.
If the IMF had to live up to private-sector standards, it would create a new instrument that would meet members’ potential demand for short-term liquidity.
“Giving confidence” to this sort of customer requires the capacity to provide quick, automatic, meaningful, and front-loaded financial support; otherwise, accumulating reserves and pooling them in regional agreements will still look like a more reliable option.
The Fund has no instrument to provide short-term liquidity to emerging markets facing capital volatility.
Some argue that furnishing members with rapid and front-loaded liquidity insurance would encourage irresponsible policies or reckless borrowing.
This latest round of monetary tightening in China reflects the authorities’ growing concern over liquidity. In 2009, M2 money supply (a key indicator used to forecast inflation) increased by 27% year on year, and credit expanded by 34%.
China’s large state sector (which accounts for more than 30% of GDP) is usually careless about losses, owing to the soft budget constraints under which they operate.
Some people would prefer China to move to a totally free market without regulation and management, but the recent crises have reminded everyone that free-market fundamentalism has its drawbacks, too.
Using bank credits to speculate in equity and housing markets is still mostly forbidden.
Latin Amercia’s middle class grew by around 50%, to 152 million, from 2003 to 2009, accounting for around 30% of the continent’s population – a proportion that undoubtedly has grown since.
Almost every social-security system in the region is losing money.
This might seem an obvious shortcoming that governments would readily sort out.
The 2008 Obama campaign used the slogan “Change we can believe in.”
And, while the book’s specific policy proposals bear little resemblance to Roosevelt’s subsequent actions, the title had an intrinsic appeal that he must have recognized.
Formulating a good metaphor for Obama’s second term is itself a task for intuitive creative thought that entails rethinking what he will propose in his second term.
The Dodd-Frank financial reforms created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so that privately issued financial products would serve the public better, and created incentives for derivatives to be traded on public markets.
PRINCETON – How the mighty International Monetary Fund has fallen. More than a decade ago, the French magazine Paris Match carried a picture of the Fund’s then Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, with the title: “The Most Powerful Frenchman in the World.”
Indeed, the Fund almost disappeared into complete oblivion during their tenure.
Sarkozy and his strategists, no doubt, thought that sending DSK to the Fund, which before the global financial crisis looked unimportant and marginal, was a brilliant coup.
The IMF’s history is also a guide to the kind of figure who works most productively in Washington.
The next one should be Eastern rather than Western, an economist rather than a politician, and a visionary rather than a tactician.
We have just lived through one of these episodes.
At the same time, while getting the crisis-response mechanisms right is important, it is not the whole story.
The G-20 is now the priority-setting and decision-making body for this kind of challenge, the crisis having made it clear that the G-7 could no longer perform this function.
The international exchange-rate system is at least partially broken.
But without it, the G-20 will mostly likely be reduced to a talking shop, characterized by good intentions, but with no effective way of realizing them.
But the current financial market turmoil has shown that there are regulatory and supervisory gaps and poorly understood international linkages that call for a global response.
Financial sector analysis should become fully integrated into the IMF’s surveillance activities.
The IMF Beyond The Crisis
It would be a big mistake to let that happen.
The IMF can help monitor whether countries follow up on agreed undertakings in the FSB, and alert leaders to gaps in the regulatory framework and vulnerabilities in the financial system that need to be addressed.
(The yuan should be included as soon as China makes its currency convertible.)
Once upon a time, the Fund had scores of programs across the Continent (as Rong Qian, Carmen Reinhart, and I illustrate in new research on “graduation” from sovereign debt crises.)
What a difference a crisis makes.
Countries usually call in the IMF only when they have been jilted by international capital markets, and are faced with desperate tightening measures no matter where they turn.
But, for the most part, the sovereign default process is slow-motion Kabuki theater.
The question for the IMF in Europe is not whether it has a plan viable for getting in. It has landed in force.
When asked about the role of capital controls, Strauss-Kahn said he was not wedded to any rigid ideology on the subject.
But more important was the symbolism of Brazil’s move, for it suggests that emerging markets may be getting over their doomed infatuation with foreign finance.
If, on the other hand, market participants do bear significant costs – either because of the taxes they pay or because of the expenses they incur to evade them – the controls will be effective in restraining inflows.
The first stop was the European Union in the late 1980’s, where two French Socialists – Jacques Delors and Pascal Lamy (the president of the European Commission and his assistant, respectively) – led the way.
The new mission is crucially important, both for the health of the global economy and the IMF’s own legitimacy.
If one looks at multilateral trade imbalances, the US stands head and shoulders above all others.
Subsidizing their own farmers would divert money from education, health, and urgently needed development projects.
It is difficult to see how a change in China’s exchange rate would have a significant effect on either savings or investments in the US – and thus how it would redress global imbalances.
With its ability to mobilize large financial resources and buttress policy credibility, the IMF can help mitigate the large economic and social costs often associated with crises.
Some observers have dubbed the new facility “EZ loan,” though few countries meeting the qualifying criteria would consider their policy achievements – and their commitment to maintaining that record – anything but “easy.”
At the same time, these reforms are only a part of a much larger plan for IMF renewal.
In particular, the IMF now recognizes that capital-account liberalization requires countries to reach a certain threshold with respect to financial and governance institutions, and that many emerging-market and developing countries have not.
Unlike in the past, however, emerging and developing countries avoided the worst, precisely because they had learned to accumulate foreign reserves and regulate cross-border capital flows, and to ease such measures to prevent or mitigate sudden stops.
But the new view also highlights an important obstacle: many advanced countries’ trade and investment treaties prohibit the regulation of cross-border finance.
Indeed, the work needed to build a more robust, stable, and safe global financial system has only just begun.
More specifically, what are the governance priorities for policymakers in 2010? This past autumn, IMF members endorsed the G-20’s proposals, and asked the Fund to address four key reform areas – the so called “Istanbul Decisions” – in 2010: the IMF’s mandate, the Fund’s financing role, governance, and multilateral surveillance.
Greater legitimacy, in turn, will make the IMF more effective in promoting economic growth and stability in all of our member states.
Policymakers have a big agenda ahead, but they have already made an impressive start.
Iceland showed that responding to the crisis by imposing capital controls could help small countries manage its impact.
Even if they are not fully effective, they are typically far better than nothing.
For progressives, these abysmal facts are part of the standard litany of frustration and justified outrage.
Now it has acknowledged the reality that financial globalization can be disruptive – inducing financial crises and economically adverse currency movements.
The problem was with domestic policies, not with financial globalization, so the solution lay not in controls on cross-border financial flows, but in domestic reforms.
The first point can be best seen using an analogy with gun controls.
Along the efficiency frontier of financial regulation, one needs to consider the tradeoff between financial innovation and financial stability.
The recent Green Paper released by the European Commission on international migration is no exception.
Finland tightened its immigration regulations in 2004, following closely the restrictive stance taken by Denmark in 2002.
But national governments remain reluctant to delegate authority: in November 2004, the European Council accepted qualified majority voting on measures concerning illegal migration, but left restrictions on legal migration subject to unanimity rules, as if legal and illegal migration were not merely two sides of the same coin.
Even if the Paper’s suggestion were plausible, which it is not, it begs a larger question: should we prevent migrants from taking entrepreneurial risks?
As a result, countries affected by the Arab Spring now face political spheres that are shaped by crowd dynamics, rather than by genuine political or ideological movements.
This discord is threatening to derail these countries’ burgeoning democratic processes, owing to growing competition between what Le Bon called the “sovereignty of the crowds” and the sovereignty of political elites.
Once in office, Obama launched the White House app, designed to give citizens a new way to connect with their leaders in Washington, including updates on the latest events, insight into administration initiatives, and access to high-resolution photos and live streams of White House events.
Then I learned to cast caution to the wind and venture an answer to this most impossible of questions.
A UNESCO project demonstrated that “each additional year of a mother’s schooling reduces the probability of the infant mortality rate by 5% to 10%”
What is it?
Data published in The Lancet last year show that the top ten most burdensome global diseases are more common in men than women, and often by a large margin.
To be sure, girls and women are less powerful, less privileged, and have fewer opportunities than men worldwide.
NEW DELHI – Competition for strategic natural resources – including water, mineral ores, and fossil fuels – has always played a significant role in shaping the terms of the international economic and political order.
Likewise, food scarcity is a growing problem for Asian countries, with crop yields and overall food production growing more slowly than demand.
The other corridor – work on which has been delayed, owing to an insurrection in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province – will stretch from the Chinese-operated port at Gwadar, near Pakistan’s border with Iran, through the Karakoram mountains to the landlocked, energy-producing Xinjiang province.
Strained political relations among most of Asia’s sub-regions make a region-wide security structure or more effective resource cooperation difficult to achieve.
At the same time, the focus on financial reform in developed economies, while warranted, has contributed to complacency in developing economies.
The financial crisis reduced private financiers’ risk appetite, making long-term exposures unappealing.
Another promising development is the growth of local-currency bond markets.
But the Indian decision also means less money for the big multinational pharmaceutical companies.
Advanced industrialized countries in earlier stages of their development benefited from faster economic growth and greater social welfare by explicitly adopting weaker IP protection than is demanded of developing countries today.
As a result, there are now numerous overlapping protections for pharmaceutical companies that are very difficult for most developing countries to contest, and that often pit their global obligations against their domestic obligations to protect their citizens’ lives and health.
Globally, there is growing recognition of the need for a more balanced IP regime.
Meanwhile, unprecedented urbanization has disrupted traditional family structures, further undermining the role that women can play in economies and societies.
The importance of overcoming these barriers to development was emphasized at a recent symposium (of which I was the chair) at Green Templeton College, Oxford.
Neonaticide (killing infants that are less than one day old), infanticide (killing infants that are more than one day old), and the practice of disposing of female children in favor of male offspring are not only barbaric; they have led to imbalanced gender ratios in many emerging markets.
CAMBRIDGE – The United States Federal Reserve’s recent announcement that it will extend its “Operation Twist” by buying an additional $267 billion of long-term Treasury bonds over the next six months - to reach a total of $667 billion this year - had virtually no impact on either interest rates or equity prices.
A shift in foreign investors’ portfolio preferences away from long-term bonds could easily trigger such a run-up in rates.
Business investment is also weak, even though large corporations have very high cash balances.
The projected increase in the long-term fiscal deficit must be reversed by stemming the growth in transfers to middle-class retirees.
He challenged the prosecution vigorously, defending himself with a feistiness that surprised nearly all who read the transcripts released by the court in real time on the trial’s first day.
A logical question to ask, then, is why the Party allowed an unprecedented degree of openness at the trial.
It is worth recalling that purging him was a deeply divisive affair at the CCP’s highest levels.
His botched – but riveting – trial may be over, but the Bo Xilai show will go on.
So how do we escape from this hole? The familiar debate is between austerity and stimulus.
Simply put, what kind of post-recovery economy do we want? This is where economics becomes political economy.
The premise of the green economic agenda is that we have reached the ecological limits of our current growth model, and that we will need to find ways of living that reduce demands on non-renewable sources of energy.
As Dani Rodrik has well put it: “If economics were only about profit maximization, it would be just another name for business administration.
Hotels and airlines were a special case: their business is dependent on shared use of capital assets.
Overall, I see a broad shift from understanding assets as something you have, to looking for a stream of utility.
With Xtify, service vendors can appeal to customers who are conveniently placed in both space and time – so they can come in now for, say, a discount latte.
You don’t particularly want to lend them out every day, but if someone is willing to pay, say, $200 to rent them for a dinner party, the trouble might be worth it. So you can set a high price to offset the inconvenience and make money on the side.
French President Jacques Chirac’s visit to India this month to complete the sale of 6 attack submarines to India will confirm once more India’s emergence as an economic and diplomatic powerhouse.
Also in December, India became the latest nation to join the EU in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) team, which aims to produce electricity using nuclear fusion, as happens in the sun.
India already is being treated with growing respect in global economic councils.
The second point of convergence between Indian and Western interests is one that will probably get no public mention during Chirac’s visit: India can perhaps serve as a counterweight to China.
NEW DELHI – The ratification by the United States Congress of the historic India-US Nuclear Agreement marks a remarkable new development in world affairs.
But the agreement’s main significance should be seen in terms of the burgeoning Indo-American relationship.
India’s place in America’s consciousness is fundamentally different from what it was just half a generation ago.
The Indian Miracle Lives
Moreover, remittances from overseas Indians remain robust, rising from $46.4 billion in 2008-2009 to $57.8 billion in 2010-2011, with the bulk coming from the blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf.
Half of India’s growth has come from private consumption, and less than 10% from external demand; by contrast, 65% of China’s real GDP growth comes from exports, and only 25% from private consumption.
An impressive 63% of Indians now have phones, up from just 9% a decade ago; 100 million new phone connections were established last year, including 40 million in rural areas; and India now has 943.5 million telephone connections.
The United Nations’ sixtieth anniversary summit in September reflected its strengths and importance in the many areas in which the international community must work together.
Some have suggested that the Iraq war proved the UN’s irrelevance.
When weapons of mass destruction were not found, the US and its small (and dwindling) “coalition of the willing” conjured up a new rationale – the struggle for democracy.
But the UN needs to be strengthened, by, for example, funding a permanent peacekeeping force.
In the United States, for example, the income share of the top 1% of the population has more than doubled since the late 1970’s, from about 8% of annual GDP to more than 20% recently, a level not reached since the 1920’s.
There was also an explosion of credit-card debt.
This story has a counterintuitive dimension.
Moreover, interest rates cannot become negative in nominal terms, and rising public debt may increasingly disable fiscal policy.
So observers should not just be asking how far similar events will spread across the region; they should be asking themselves what kind of changes might be coming at home in the face of similar, if not quite so extreme, economic pressures.
The Internet and the financial sector continue to spawn new multi-millionaires and even billionaires at a staggering pace.
We live in an era in which globalization expands the market for ultra-talented individuals but competes away the income of ordinary employees.
Yes, the problems facing Egypt and Tunisia today are far more profound than in many other countries.
A few years ago, in Beijing, he ran one of China's most popular TV shows, each week testing the limits of the authorities' indulgence.
Twenty-five years ago, China had a more egalitarian society than Sweden; today there is vast inequality between city and countryside, between the western provinces and those bordering the Pacific ocean, and within cities, which attract a constant flow of former peasants looking for jobs.
But Indian voters have turned against this model.
More important decisions require an even larger consensus, involving up to 3,000 people.
Regime Change in China?
The exclusive and closed nature of autocracy bars many talented individuals from rising to senior government positions, owing to a pattern of succession that rewards political loyalty over capabilities.
As each preceding generation of rulers cashes in its illicit gains from holding power, the successors are motivated by both the desire to loot even more and the fear that there may not be much left by the time they get their turn at the trough.
But the record of democratic transitions since 1974 suggests that regime change in China is unlikely to be calamitous.
ATHENS – European integration implies successive transfers of national sovereignty to the Union.
There is no easy solution to these problems.
In fact, de-politicization is seen to be advisable because it allows for the easy achievement of balances.
The Lisbon Treaty envisages the EU as a highly outward-looking entity on the international stage.
The EMU is evidence of that.
More recently, local commissions, non-governmental organizations, an increasingly assertive media, and sanctioned public demonstrations have become established channels for mediating social conflict.
Such protests against public agencies, employers, and developers are now commonplace (though not always authorized).
Both policies reflect the skewed distribution of China’s population, with more than 90% squeezed into the eastern half of the country, creating extreme congestion and the potential for political instability.
During the past five years, the consumer price index has increased at an annual rate of just 1.5%.

Since reserves in excess of the required amount did not earn any interest from the Fed before 2008, commercial banks had an incentive to lend to households and businesses until the resulting growth of deposits used up all of those excess reserves.
The size of the broad money stock (known as M2) grew at an average rate of just 6.2% a year from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012.
That outcome is more likely if high rates of long-term unemployment and underemployment persist even as the inflation rate rises.
Associations – committees of Catholic business owners, labor leaders, and officials – must set quotas, prices, and wages within vertically connected swaths of the economy called corporations.

Indeed, Corporatism spread to country after country.
Indeed, the prominence of Corporatism in Catholic education is remarkable.
Corporatist subsidiarity lets the top of the hierarchy determine its own powers, while banishing competition and lauding private property generates inequality and inefficiency simultaneously.
How odd of Mao’s heirs, however accidentally, to resurrect this forsaken Catholic ideology.
The free flow of information constrains official power and gives individuals the power to act for themselves.
This virus would continuously nudge government agencies to become more effective and accessible, rather than merely more efficient.
Openness and transparency do not mean simply making everything available online, but making information easy to get to, compare, and analyze.
Two big changes are necessary.
The recent dispatch of inspectors to verify the shutdown of North Korea’s weapons reactor and the continuing efforts to ferret out Iran’s nuclear intentions are only the most visible signs of its monitoring function.
Today, this responsibility extends to more than 180 countries.
And in 2004, the IAEA blew the whistle on South Korea’s non-safeguarded plutonium and enrichment experiments.
The unwillingness of more than half the NPT membership to apply the Additional Protocol, which gives the IAEA new flexibility to uncover clandestine nuclear activity, undermines global security.
NEW YORK – Viruses, phishing, spyware, spam, denial-of-service attacks, botnets… You have probably heard these words, and perhaps even suffered from what they signify, with or without knowing it.
They are technically savvy organizations with the ability (more or less) to protect users and detect abusers; they have a direct (though impersonal) relationship with their users; and they compete for users’ business, so that, unlike governments, they will suffer if they perform badly. 
Google does this in its search results, working with StopBadware.org (I am an advisory board member), and both Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer offer similar protections.  In all cases, adventurous users or professionals can overcome the paternalism, but only by paying what amounts to liability insurance, for the risks they impose on the system.
So how do we make this happen? ISPs need to pass these costs on to their customers.
In 1904, US President Theodore Roosevelt argued that, “there are occasional crimes committed on so vast a scale and of such peculiar horror” that we should intervene by force of arms.
Until last year, many observers regarded R2P as at best a pious hope or a noble failure.
Such factors are symptomatic of larger problems with humanitarian interventions.
Military interventions in Sierra Leone, Liberia, East Timor, and Bosnia did not solve all problems, but they did improve the lives of the people there.
At the center of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the “responsibility to protect.”
As a result of this neglect, a noxious social and political residue pervades today’s Kosovo.
This brings me to another key point: a workable exit strategy is just as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention as the entry strategy.

First, Europe is as much a frontline region in the war on terror as it was during the Cold War.  As last year’s aborted attack on ten airliners heading to the US from London revealed, the likelihood of a terrorist attack on American citizens emanating from a European country remains high.  America may not need the French military, but it certainly needs the French intelligence services. 
The same is true of nations.
Skeptics reply that it would be wrong to link the Iraq War to the “Arab Spring,” because events in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011 had their own origins, while President George W. Bush’s actions and rhetoric discredited, rather than advanced, the cause of democracy in the region.
Bush and his officials used three main arguments to justify invading Iraq.
Most countries agreed that Saddam had defied United Nations Security Council resolutions for a dozen years.
Good coaches analyze their game and their opponent’s game, so that they can capitalize on errors and benefit from “good luck.”
To be sure, Iraqis of different ethnic or religious backgrounds are divided over many issues, but they also embrace a common national identity, as well as a desire for democracy.
Similarly, 78% of Kurds rejected polygamy, compared to just 49% of both Shi’ites and Sunnis.
Leaders of these groups often defended terrorism by insisting that violence was the only means of bringing hope to demoralized people.
The Irish Think Again About the Lisbon Treaty
So the inter-linkage between the ratification crises in Ireland and the Czech Republic is now explicit and threatens to spill over into the wider EU arena in 2009.
Political declarations on the issues outlined would be registered as international treaties at the United Nations to provide binding legal force.
The extraordinary implosion of global financial markets may also work to the advantage of the Yes side in a second referendum, because Ireland’s economic future cannot be contemplated seriously outside of EU structures.
The first Turkish ruler to reign over the Ecumenical Patriarchate was Mehmed II, the Ottoman Sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453.
The Armenians, who suffered the worst tragedy in 1915, never forgot nor forgave.
But you can either trap yourself inside history or take lessons from it and move on.
They realize that religious freedom must be championed for all. And they have a good frame of reference in the pluralism of the Ottomans.
The rage across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark (months ago) of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed, together with the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of Iran’s politics, has made “political Islam” a fundamental question of international diplomacy.
It is no accident that there are Islamists in the legislatures of all the countries undergoing some form of political reform, including Lebanon, where Hezbollah is part of a freely elected government, as well as Jordan and Morocco.
It is now necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to attain their national goals.
Political Islam is a risk, but we can minimize it only by devising intelligent, case-sensitive strategies that promote democracy, not by denouncing the results of democratic choice.
It must avoid the pernicious ethnic nationalism of recent years that led to one ethnic group being banned from running in the presidential election.
These handicaps to the country’s development grew worse over time.
The political upheavals of 1999-2000 resulted in a new “democratic” constitution that became an invitation to civil war.
The division of the country into more ethnically homogeneous federal components might also promote stability.
Policymaking is often dominated by simple “lessons learned” from economic history.
If two countries achieve the same growth in average WAP income, one should conclude that both have been equally efficient in using their potential, even if their overall GDP growth rates differ.
The US has done slightly worse than suggested by this rough measure; Japan has done a bit better; and most other rich countries come pretty close.
First, the idea of a Japanese-style “lost decade” is misleading – even when applied to Japan.
All these books are variations of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the Russian forgery first published in 1903, which Japanese came across after defeating the Czar’s army in 1905.
In fact, few Chinese, Japanese, Malaysians, or Filipinos have ever seen a Jew, unless they have spent time abroad.
One of the great ironies of colonial history is the way in which colonized people adopted some of the very prejudices that justified colonial rule.
But, instead of wishing to attack them, the Japanese, being a practical people, decided that they would be better off cultivating those clever, powerful Jews as friends.
If you include partially employed workers and discouraged workers who left the US labor force, for example, the unemployment rate is already 16.5%.
By the end of this year about 8.4 million US individuals with mortgages will be unemployed and unable to service their mortgages.
If, like Japan in the late 1990’s and the US in 1937, they take the threat of large deficits seriously and raise taxes and cut spending too much too soon, their economies could fall back into recession.
On the other hand, however, the Court’s decision is one of those judicial pronouncements that attempts to give something to everybody and leave everything as it was.
To decide whether Mladic acted on Serbia’s account when he was planning and ordering the Srebrenica massacre, the Court demanded proof that Serbian officials sent him specific “instructions” to commit this act of genocide.
After all, one can also be guilty of complicity in a crime by not stopping it while having both the duty and the power to do so, and when, through one’s inaction, one decisively contributes to the creation of conditions that enable the crime to take place.
But these potential gains will be realized only if US President Barack Obama gives India the attention it deserves, and if both countries broaden the strategic stake by involving their private sectors in issues that governments alone cannot resolve.
In terms of counterterrorism, the tragic events in Mumbai present an opportunity to ratchet up intelligence sharing, joint response training, and personnel exchanges to defeat the defining threat of our times.
India and the US are natural partners in meeting this challenge, with innovative scientists and venture capitalists who can take technology breakthroughs from the lab to the market, and NGOs with vast grassroots conservation and public advocacy experience.
Perhaps the best way to look at the situation is to recall that three locomotives have driven the world economy over the past 15 years.
The world economy, as John Maynard Keynes put it 75 years ago, is developing magneto trouble.
But low interest rates are entirely compatible with stagnation or depression if risk premia remain large – as the world learned in the 1930’s, and as Japan relearned in the 1990’s.
As a result, investors are worried that China could slip into the excess-leverage growth model that has served many developed economies so poorly.
It is certainly less clear than the previous story, which cannot be retold.
If policymakers choose a model based on a large state-dominated sector protected from internal and external competition, innovation objectives are unlikely to be met, adversely affecting future growth.
Beyond that, more inclusive growth depends on the completion of the urbanization process that underpins the creation of a modern economy; addressing corruption and unequal access to market opportunities; and aggressively mitigating well-known and serious environmental problems.
A quarter of Cambodia's population of eight million was executed, starved to death, or succumbed to disease during the Khmer Rouge's rule from 1975-79.
The first obstacle is cost.
There is thus concern that some in Cambodia's government - which includes officials who once served under the Khmer Rouge - will seek to hijack the trials for political ends.
Before long, an effort to document and publish the truth will be necessary.
Of course, as the murders show, Colombia remains a bizarre place, one facing strange and intractable challenges.
The so-called parapolítica scandals have rocked Uribe’s government, forcing the resignation of some cabinet ministers, and embarrassing others, including the president himself.
But, just as former US Vice-President Al Gore recently refused to share a dais with Uribe in Miami, many members of Congress refuse to approve a trade agreement or an aid package that may link them to a government tainted by egregious human rights abuses, complicity with drug lords, or both.
NEW HAVEN – I admit that it is an unusual way to see the world, but, when reading the newspaper, I am constantly struck by the extent of human kindness.
The explanation for our expanded morality comes from intelligence, imagination, and culture.
An individual who didn’t distinguish between his or her own child and an unknown child in a faraway land – who felt the same love and the same obligation toward both – would hardly be human anymore.
Just as giving to someone in need elicits a positive neural response, so does taking from someone who deserves it.
The Kingdom and the Afghan Chaos
Only recently, it seems, has the Saudi regime discovered the great soft power that its custodianship of Mecca and Medina – Islam’s holiest sites – provides.
But Saudi soft power extends beyond custodianship of Mecca and Medina, for Saudi diplomacy is also backed by the largest oil reserves in the world.
The Iranians vehemently oppose the return of Taliban control over Afghanistan’s government.
Berkeley – Since 2003, I have been saying that the global economy is badly unbalanced and vulnerable to a macroeconomic catastrophe that would yield one of the worst episodes of economic distress of modern times.
I wish – as the Fed does – that some way could have been found to make financial-sector equity holders bear an even larger share of the losses that are coming down the road than they have borne so far or are likely to bear.
That would not be good for America or the world.
Having beaten his Socialist rival, Ségolène Royal, Sarkozy decided to compound the Socialists’ crisis by appointing to his government several political figures long associated with the center-left.
While not denying that state sovereignty was the basis of the international system, Kouchner insisted that it could not be a license for governments to kill.
Grave human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, and genocide would no longer be permitted.
Foreign Minister Kouchner calls international conferences, speaks of establishing contact groups, and of the need for deliberate action.
Redistributing some of the profits from high energy prices enabled the regime to improve living standards and make itself popular with ordinary Russians.
But if prices remain stagnant at current levels, Putin’s system is doomed to failure.
And Obama’s triumph heralded the fall in oil prices.
Now, the ruling group is uniform, unanimous, and most likely unfit for any serious revision of policy.
But this is not news anymore in Putin’s Russia.
General Charles de Gaulle once described himself as a “bad weather friend” of the United States, which implied that in “better weather” he could go his own way, leave NATO’s integrated military command, and behave as some kind of bridge between East and West.
This legitimate “mercantile” concern has supposedly been reciprocated by “small steps” by Russia in the direction of a policy of sanctions against Iran.
The idea that you can play a Medvedev card to balance Putin is a dangerous illusion.
The Kremlin Two Step
For all the apparent freshness of Medvedev’s recent pronouncements, including his now famous article “Go Russia!” – which sounded a clarion call for modernization and liberalism – he is borrowing massively from Putin’s vocabulary of 2000.
Putin wants to finish the job, and much works in his favor. He is the tsar.
Conservative modernization is a gamble.
Both members need each other.
And, yes, of course, it was the same Cliff Reid I knew back in the late 1980’s.
On the other hand, we have started recognizing some words – specific genetic variants – that seem to correspond to certain incidents in history.
We don’t know why, but the correlation is clear.
Most of these are harmless; the really harmful ones don’t survive long enough to show up anywhere.
The current movement in many developed countries towards electronic medical records will improve health care directly, but it will also lead to much improved information liquidity to help genetic and other medical research.
The paradox is that, for a man who wielded so much power for so long, it is unclear what domestic legacy, if any, Blair will leave.
Blair still does.
Blair’s vision of wars of values rather than interests has increasingly come to seem like a moral flag of convenience – in a way similar to the use of human rights by the rich world’s governments to justify their continued domination of institutions like the World Bank and the IMF.
Those pressing for military intervention in Darfur would probably say that this is a bad thing.
At first, the Israeli police used force against the protesters, even though such demonstrations are perfectly legal in Israel.
But some are simply appropriated.
This implies that Jews can push farther and farther into East Jerusalem, as well as build settlements on Palestinian territories around the city, which Israel now claims to be part of Jerusalem.
But the protests are worthwhile for another reason: they are good for Israel.
Citizens are coarsened by the casual brutality meted out to a minority, and become inured to it.
Objections from European and Asian allies were brushed away as old-fashioned, unimaginative, cowardly reactions to the dawn of a new age of worldwide democracy, enforced by unassailable US military power.
This is what happened when Bush and Cheney took up the ideas promoted by the neo-cons.
The idealism of Japanese intellectuals in the 1930’s and early 1940’s was partly responsible for Japan’s catastrophic war to “liberate” Asia from Western imperialism.
There is a core of truth in this assertion.
The Chinese have much to answer for, but the fate of Tibet is not just a matter of semi-colonial oppression.
The wrecking of tradition and forced cultural regimentation took place everywhere in China.
Regional identity, cultural diversity, and traditional arts and customs have been buried under concrete, steel, and glass all over China.
Meanwhile, Chinese and other foreign tourists dress up in traditional Tibetan dress to have their souvenir pictures taken in front of the Dalai Lama’s old palace.
Outside Tibet, however, it is a different story.
Given that resource extraction per square kilometer in Africa is about 20% of the OECD average, the total volume of extraction could easily grow fivefold.
Second, a substantial share of the revenues should be invested in assets rather than used to boost consumption.
Such hostility has made the local operations of extractive industries problematic and costly: witness Royal Dutch Shell’s experience in the Niger Delta. Attacks on installations have often escalated to the point that overall supplies are significantly reduced and less secure.
What is now needed is global enforcement of transparency standards.
When Vice President Dick Cheney spoke at the last World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he was asked how the administration could justify what was taking place in Guatanamo Bay, where prisoners are being kept without being charged and without counsel.
The abuses should have been covered months ago.
We know that individuals and institutions make mistakes. Such mistakes are all the more likely in times of stress.
Each of them was motivated by the horrific lessons of the past.
Assad is particularly worried about the creation of a mixed Lebanese-international court to try suspects in the Hariri assassination.
In the coming weeks, Hezbollah will have to calculate at several levels.
The US must also calculate what the Europeans will accept.
One idea – to elect a candidate with whom everyone can live – would likely produce a weak president.
While Syria’s Lebanese allies have called for improved ties between the two countries, the Hariri murder makes this doubtful.
Within Lebanon, the Sunni-Shiite divide reflects broader regional frictions between the Sunni-majority Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, which backs Saad Hariri, the late prime minister’s son, and Iran, which supports Hezbollah.
Whatever one thinks about the war in Iraq, the US presence there has helped Lebanon to ward off Syrian efforts to reverse its withdrawal, as well as Arab efforts to compel the Lebanese to compromise with a regime that loathes Lebanese sovereignty.
The Israel-Hezbollah war of 2006 reminded the Union, once again, that its strategic interests do not always coincide perfectly with those of the United States.
In effect, the resolution envisaged reversing Hezbollah’s gains and ignores the deep changes that have occurred in Lebanese society, most importantly the Shia community’s growing self-confidence.
Giving the Shia a real stake in the nations in which they live is the only way to satisfy the craving for empowerment that they feel after so many years of suppression.
PARIS – The riots that have rampaged across Greece may have many causes, but one that is rarely mentioned is the fracturing of the Greek left into George Papandreou’s traditional socialist party, PASOK, and an increasingly radicalized faction that refuses all accommodation with either the European Union or modern economics.
Is the present crisis a crisis of capitalism or just a phase of it? This controversy keeps left-wing intellectuals, pundits, and politicians busy on television talk shows and in café debates across Europe.
The Socialists blame greedy financiers, but who does not? In terms of remedies, the Socialists do not offer anything more than the Keynesian solutions that are now being proposed by the right.
European Socialists are also finding it hard to distinguish themselves in foreign affairs.
The lesson from Greece, however, is that what European Socialists should fear most is the far left’s taste and talent for disruption.
Loans to Ireland (€85 billion) and Portugal (€78 billion) are also significantly bigger than those usually provided by the IMF.
There is one bright spot: Ireland, which is set to recover from an exceptionally severe financial crisis.
Once it became clear that the burden was unbearable, debt should have been cut expeditiously.
The ECB is in an odd position as well, but for different reasons.
The world can look to Europe as a model that is not only up and running, but that works.
Firms can readily compare their cost of abating an extra ton of emissions with the cost of the allowance required if that ton is released into the atmosphere.
The fact is that the European economy has been affected more by sub-prime mortgages in the United States than by a carbon price in Europe.
The third broad lesson from the ETS is that multinational emissions-trading regimes can be constructed.
The real problem is one of political will, not of institutional mechanics.
Both sides in these disputes usually omit to mention the key idiosyncratic characteristics and specific starting conditions that can make direct comparisons meaningless.
Latvia’s government increased taxes during the bust to keep revenues roughly constant as a share of GDP, but a sizeable fiscal deficit emerged nonetheless as social-security expenditure, such as unemployment benefits, soared while demand and output collapsed.
That sustained demand provided an important stabilizer for the domestic economy, which the Baltic states did not have.
One must be careful when attempting to draw lessons from the experience of small countries that sometimes have very particular characteristics.
Perestroika took place at a unique moment in Russian history.
Thus, perestroika took place in a void.
Much of what socialism built needed to be undone.
We must recognize that and understand that it emerges not only when the public is apathetic or frightened, but also when there is no apparent stable advanced guard, such as powerful political parties, which choose the leaders and control them.
The country needs a deeper commitment to reform that will come only when its institutions engage the Russian public in the sort of open debate that we have lacked.
It was a desperate time, brief but seared in our memories, when indiscriminate killings on trains, in taxis, and on buses were common, a time of massacres at regular intervals – Sebokeng, Thokoza, Bisho, Boipatong, and the killing fields of KwaZulu Natal, owing to the bloody rivalry between the African National Congress and the ethnic Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party.
Truth, not punishment, was to bring about healing.
The lesson of South Africa’s transition is that no divided country has a future if it insists on going forward without truth and forgiveness.
Remembrance and forgiveness have allowed our remembered nightmares to be consigned to the past.
Their bad assets will be separated and wound down over time.
No bank in difficulties can survive if the ECB does not grant or renew emergency liquidity assistance.
But financial markets reacted calmly to the news that, for the first time, even depositors in a bank in the European Union will lose part of their money (and this was noted with glee in Berlin and elsewhere in northern Europe).
Joy over the election’s outcome, however, should not blind us to its failure to meet a series of ethical benchmarks for democratic choice.
Unfortunately, the most recent debates failed to achieve that goal.
Needless to say, neither candidate thought it worthwhile to put forward a proposal to assist the more than one billion people living in extreme poverty.
The Lessons of the World Cup
But the demand side was heavily regulated, owing to a rule that clubs could field no more than two foreign players in any single game.
In Spain, all but three championships since 1985 have been won by either Real Madrid or Barcelona.
The average winning margin among the top eight World Cup national teams has steadily decreased, from more than two goals in the 1950’s, to about 1.5 goals in the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s, and only 0.88 goals in the 2002 World Cup.
The same rule could be applied to other activities.
And what was the result? Convinced that he is right, and incurious to hear contrary arguments, Bush felt free to undermine the rule of law in America with warrantless domestic surveillance, erosion of due process, and defense of torture, in addition to misleading the public and refusing to heed expert advice or recognize facts on the ground.
Putin’s assessment of US unilateralism (if stripped of its overheated rhetoric) may be correct; the trouble is that he lacks credibility to extol moderation in foreign policy.
Indeed, the American people have preempted the historians, rebuking Bush by electing a Democratic Congress in November 2006.
As Council president, France, which shares America’s views about the need to strengthen sanctions on Iran’s government, can raise the matter, something that China eschewed during its tenure in January as Council leader.
Qadaffi exploited a network of opportunity. French-controlled mines in Niger provided uranium ore. An undisclosed country conveyed a pilot uranium conversion facility.
As a result, the government’s confidence and hold on power were shaken.
The Limits of Bonapartism
For all the authoritarian habits of de Gaulle or François Mitterand, Sarkozy’s personalization of the presidency is unprecedented in the history of the Fifth Republic.
In the meantime, his obsession with dominating the daily news cycle, no matter how flimsy the pretext, continues unabated.
Putting an Australian mining executive behind bars for ten years, squeezing out Google, keeping the European Union at bay for an important dialogue, and letting a mid-level official wag his finger at US President Barack Obama at the Copenhagen Climate summit is not, after all, the best way to convince partners of your constructive intentions.
In Brussels and Washington, one gets the impression that the mission of China’s diplomats nowadays is to meet and charm everyone.
One can have the most visible business summits possible, but if Western companies do not gain greater access to the Chinese market, or if they feel threatened by heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises, relations will continue to sour.
For China, it will be hard to build confidence if Europe and the US doubt their own future.
Indeed, with roughly 130 million middle-class consumers, China’s domestic market holds significant potential.
More than 1,400 foreign-funded R&amp;D institutions are currently operating in China, and data from China’s Ministry of Commerce indicate that 480 of the world’s top 500 companies have established local subsidiaries.
As China’s “demographic dividend” disappears, its low-end labor market is shrinking, driving up its once rock-bottom labor costs and diminishing its rate of return on capital.
The election of the militant and hitherto extra-parliamentary group Hamas in the Palestinian territories reminds us of what democracy cannot achieve.
In particular, they do not create a liberal order.
Who sets the rules of the game? There is an obvious logic to establishing a constitutional convention first and then holding elections under the rules agreed by it.
One must add to this criterion a culture of debate that makes elections a genuine contest of a plurality of answers to the issues at stake.
An absurd expectation, one might think.
On the eve of the financial crisis, other Gulf states had started to look to Dubai for insight into how they might diversify their economies and continue to thrive when the oil wells run dry.
One had to be impressed that such ideas could be expressed openly.
Is this the end of the road for Dubai’s epic growth? I doubt it.
Already, variations in the composition of about 500,000 DNA building blocks (SNPs or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), spread over the total length of the DNA and shown to correlate with particular physical and behavioral characteristics or susceptibility to diseases, are being analyzed routinely.
Nonetheless, the dangers implied by recent technological progress have become increasingly obvious.
Major regional powers like Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar now support an emboldened Hamas, whose paramount objectives are now to consolidate its increased international legitimacy and sideline the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA).

Hamas’s military collapse would not pave the way for the moderate Fatah to return to power in Gaza; it would enthrone Islamic Jihad and Al Qaeda.
The current cease-fire, however, will be as short lived as many others before it – its terms are practically identical to those that ended Operation Cast Lead – if Israel does not follow up with a vigorous peace initiative on the broader Palestinian front.
Christianity, with its belief that God (or the Son of God) sacrificed Himself to expiate humanity’s sins, inverted the traditional economy of sacrifice.
Churchill gave Britons something to look forward to: victory.
Europe’s leaders must imbue their citizens with renewed hope.
Today, Germany has a balanced budget, whereas most other eurozone countries are running deficits that are higher than Germany’s ten years ago.
On one hand, wage restraint was the key element, though the government could not impose it.
Long-term fiscal consolidation requires, in the first instance, expenditure restraint; and labor-market reforms can, over time, bring marginal groups into employment.
The reforms undertaken in some peripheral countries are much deeper than those undertaken by Germany a decade ago.
By offering to lend freely against collateral, they “liquify” assets and prevent banks from being forced to unload loans or securities at fire-sale prices.
Indeed, with its recent decision to pursue QE3, the Fed is focusing once again on the mortgage-backed securities market; but, given that the market is much healthier now, it is unclear how much good this will do.
In theory, as capital floods in, these countries’ exchange rates will appreciate rapidly, making them look unattractive and automatically stemming the flow.
A last defense offered by advocates of continuing on the path of adventurous monetary policy, even when the perceived benefits are small, is that, because politicians refuse to settle their differences and act, monetary policy is “the only game in town.”
But is it true?
This pattern of trade has now been mirrored in the increasing geographical spread of BSE from the UK to other countries in Europe, and more recently to Japan and the United States. This unfortunately has been accompanied by increasing number of variant CJD cases in Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and the USA.
Further uncertainty regarding the future of variant CJD arises from the observation that the average age of the patients in the UK has not increased significantly over the past 10 years. If the epidemic were in decline, it might be anticipated that the average age of the patients would increase in the final stages (as occurred with cattle in the UK that were infected with BSE).
Malnutrition kills an innocent child every five seconds, and is responsible for 11% of the global burden of disease.
Indeed, stunting has come to represent the true face of contemporary global poverty, causing irreparable damage to children’s cognitive development and physical growth.
We must make markets work for them and their families.
Similarly, in India’s Rajasthan state, high-quality complementary foods produced by decentralized women’s self-help groups are improving the nutrition of children aged 6-36 months.
Liquid assets are assets that resemble cash, because they can easily be converted into cash and used to buy other assets.
Central banks worldwide clearly have been behaving quite responsibly with regard to general inflation since 2005.
True, savings rates in emerging markets and oil-rich countries have been increasing since 1970, and especially in the last few years, but this has been offset by declining saving rates in advanced countries.
He says that it merely reflects a feedback mechanism that is always present: any initial upward shock to asset prices strengthens the balance sheets of financial institutions, so in response they borrow more and bid up prices even more.
Yet, because an exchange rate is a relative price, all currencies cannot weaken simultaneously.
It is just over a year since Switzerland surprised many when it announced, and strictly implemented, a threshold beyond which its currency would not be allowed to appreciate against the euro.
Yet, when push comes to shove, country after country is being dragged into abetting a potentially harmful outcome for the global economy as a whole.
Specifically, it is hoped that an artificial surge in asset prices will make people feel richer and more optimistic, thus triggering “wealth effects” and “animal spirits” that stimulate consumption and investment spending, bolster job creation, and, in the process, “validate” the artificial asset pricing.
This period of expanding policy inconsistencies could prove to be temporary and reversible if central banks succeed in jolting economies out of their malaise, and if countries come to recognize that greater cross-border policy coordination is urgently needed.
The headline numbers do not look so bad.
Inflation is increasing beyond what can be explained by rising commodity and food prices, while credit growth and some asset prices are starting to look high relative to historical standards.
Fiscal repair is also essential.
It is fragile, unbalanced, and limited.
At the same time, a recent "white paper" produced by a working group headed by the IMF's former boss, Michel Camdessus, which was charged with proposing the type of structural reforms needed to achieve growth, was received with the usual outcry from trade unions.
But real tax cuts also mean spending cuts and, as elections loom barely a year from now, it is too late.
First, it makes consumers anxious and depresses demand.
KATMANDU – Confounding everyone except themselves, Nepal’s hard-line Maoists have taken a commanding role following the country’s landmark elections.
A second priority will be to decide the fate of Nepal’s centuries-old monarchy.
The main challenge for the Assembly is to forge onward, keeping in mind that the road ahead is full of seemingly insurmountable challenges.
What’s more, they will have also helped to improve their own lives and enhance the economic prospects of their wider community.
What all of this means is that by measuring the effectiveness of vaccines merely in terms of “lives saved,” we could be seriously underestimating the full extent of the benefits that they offer.
As a result, we have prevented 5.5 million deaths, and we aim to immunize a further 245 million children and save five million more lives by 2015.
Development economists wring their hands in despair: Africa defies their best efforts to create a miracle.
Despite the eight-fold increase in aid per head to the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1960 and 2007, real GDP per head decreased by two-thirds in the same period.
Many countries had “failed” states that could not provide even the minimum conditions of security and health. With 15% of the world’s population, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 88% of the world’s conflict-related deaths and 65% of AIDS victims.
Citing the British mission to Sierra Leone, Collier argues for military intervention, when feasible, to secure peace.
Other efforts worthy of attention include formalizing the huge informal economy in states such as Ghana.
Sustainable development therefore requires that, relative to their populations, each generation should bequeath to its successor at least as large a productive base as it inherited.
When an economy eats into its productive base in order to raise current production, eventually GNP will decline, too, unless policies were to so change that wealth begins to accumulate.
As for natural capital, the World Bank has so far limited itself to the atmosphere as a sink for carbon dioxide, oil, and natural gas, and forests as sources of timber.
But there are limits to substitutability: the costs of substitution (including human ingenuity) often increase in previously unknown ways as key resources are degraded.
But Lula’s popularity reflects his political skill as much as the success of his social and economic program.
Consumption is being spurred by record-low unemployment rates, below 7%, and by credit growth, which has doubled, from 22% to 45% of GDP, between 2002 and 2010.
A recent decline in primary surpluses has added to the problem.
FEZ – Just over a year ago, the Arab Spring sparked dramatic change throughout the Arab world.
This new political reality in the Maghreb will bring Europe –&nbsp;particularly France, the region’s old colonial master – face-to-face with Islamist governments determined to promote a new type of relationship.
That remains very much an open question.
Before an economically unified Maghreb can be realized, however, inter-state conflicts such as the Algerian-Moroccan dispute over the “Western” Sahara must be resolved.
For starters, it remains unclear whether the Federal Reserve will begin to “taper” its open-ended quantitative easing (QE) in September or later, how fast it will reduce its purchases of long-term assets, and when and how fast it will start to raise interest rates from their current zero level.
Germany’s general election appears likely to produce a repeat of the current government coalition of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democrats, with opinion polls suggesting that a grand coalition between the CDU and the Social Democrats is less likely.
These economies – the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and others – were overhyped for too long.
The looming known unknowns are plentiful.
Z. A. Bhutto’s legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people’s rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule.
After almost a decade in self-imposed exile, Bhutoo’s return to Pakistan in October gave her a fresh political start.
Whether or not the government was involved, the fact remains that Pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader.
Moreover, although China’s “trade dependency” is now reckoned to be 70% of GDP, that figure is greatly distorted by the fact that Chinese exports require massive imports of materials and parts.
That is exactly what is happening in China now.
If that is true, and China shouldn’t worry about the renminbi’s exchange rate, should it worry about its economy overheating? After all, its previous trade deficits in the era of reform – such as in 1992-1996 and 2003-2004 – all occurred at times of overheating.
That means that investment is extremely high – and that, despite the high share of infrastructure investment, there is an urgent need to manage the potential risks.
Martin Luther King, Jr. benefited from growing up in an African-American church tradition rich in the rhythms of the spoken word.
If one compares those images with pictures of the young insecure Gandhi dressed as a proper British lawyer, one can see how carefully he understood symbolic communication.
Organizational skills – the ability to attract and inspire an effective inner circle of followers – can compensate for rhetorical deficiencies, just as effective public rhetoric can partly compensate for low organizational skills.
During the 2008 presidential election campaign, Obama proved to be a talented communicator.
BRUSSELS – If French President Nicolas Sarkozy had written the prologue to his presidency of the G-20, which has just commenced, he could not have done better.
Japan is keen, but its views on regional monetary cooperation do not match China’s.
Many, especially in Asia and the Persian Gulf, are de facto linked to the dollar, others to the euro.
This rule normally ensures a modicum of coherence and avoids overreactions in exchange rates, but it is insufficient in deflationary times.
These reserves now amount to 15% of global GDP, compared to 6% ten years ago.
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell once compared a monetary regime to a political constitution, because it establishes the rules of the game.
Everybody was tired, but my father wasn’t in a hurry to sleep.
The story occupied the same amount of space as a report on Zhukov’s visit to Yugoslavia, and ran in a less prestigious position.
The committee requested it from the Soviet government.
Korolev was offended but kept silent.
Technically, Glushko, by government order, continued to design engines for Korolev, but the work wasn’t good.
Moreover, the benefits of the growth have been shared.
Moreover, Malaysia’s multiracial, multi-cultural society made it more vulnerable to civil strife, which has occurred in many other resource-rich countries, as one group tried to seize the wealth for itself.
Malaysia wisely took an alternative course, looking instead to the highly successful countries of East Asia.
He is a fluent English speaker who does not have a secret-service background and has been dealing with the West for almost a decade as the Russian energy industry’s leading figure.
Given Gazprom’s record of opacity while Medvedev’s was in charge, the existence of kompromat (compromising material), used as blackmail against him to keep his energy policy in line and others’ vested interests safe, is highly likely.
“Putinism” is predicated on the need for an enemy, and that enemy, at least since 2003, is the West.
NEW YORK – Economists long ago put to rest the error that Adam Smith made when he argued that manufacturing should be given primacy in a country’s economy.
In fact, the dubious notion that we should select economic activities based on their presumed technical innovativeness has been carried even further, in support of the argument that we should favor semiconductor chips over potato chips.
But this argument is specious: one can have a vigorous transportation industry, with trucks, rail, and air cargo moving agricultural produce within and across nations, as countries such as pre-Peronist Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and modern Chile have done very successfully.
Even if you wanted to curtail financial services, you could still focus on the multitude of non-financial services.
Without a vibrant manufacturing base, societies tend to divide between rich and poor – those who have access to steady, well-paying jobs, and those whose jobs are less secure and lives more precarious.
The growing proportion of low-productivity labor has also contributed to rising inequality in American society.
When manufacturing takes off, it can generate millions of jobs for unskilled workers, often women, who previously were employed in traditional agriculture or petty services.
I have found in my research that individual manufacturing industries, such as auto parts or machinery, exhibit what economists call “unconditional convergence” – an automatic tendency to close the gap with productivity levels in advanced countries.
But if this happens more rapidly than workers can acquire advanced skills, the result can be a dangerous imbalance between an economy’s productive structure and its workforce.
There are many places where savings can be made.
The system by which doctors and hospitals are paid is another factor in providing expensive treatment that is of little benefit to the patient.
The artificial heart machine, also known as a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, has been used to keep patients alive until they receive a heart transplant.
Against that background, spending $200,000 to give a patient in an affluent country a relatively short period of extra life becomes more than financially dubious. It is morally wrong.
Monarchies – in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and most of the Gulf dynasties – still appear to their subjects to be more acceptable than secular autocracies.
For, in the Gulf, the issue for the US is not democracy versus autocracy; it is one of an Iran-led Shia axis versus the Sunni pro-Western incumbent regimes.
But historical turning points have never been characterized by easy choices, and human blunders frequently shape outcomes more than human wickedness.
In other words, although a caudillo ’s charisma matters, he or she is a social creation.
Traditional parties and the administrations that preceded the caudillo are dismissed as corrupt and elitist.
A decline in extreme poverty and inequality, and the creation of trustworthy institutions, can be achieved in the country’s beguiled by caudillismo only if the caudillo loses control of the wealth that sustains his rule.
On the contrary, in the early part of the twentieth century, Germany was one of the world's richest countries, with enviably high education levels and scientific prowess.
There is no glory on either side of the Israel-Palestine debacle.
A third respondent said something similar. "There was so much outrage about the prisoner abuse, which I certainly don't approve of, but this was much worse," she said, referring to the Berg murder.
Once we recognize how vulnerable all of the world is to this kind of descent into violence, the importance of international law and international institutions such as the United Nations become all the more obvious.
The Market Confidence Bugaboo
For, if economic logic were clear-cut, governments wouldn’t have to justify what they do on the basis of market confidence.
They depend not just on its tax and spending plans but also on the state of the economy, the external conjuncture, and the political context.
The silver lining in all this is that, unlike economists and politicians, markets have no ideology.
Rather than face up to the challenge, leaders first procrastinated and then buckled under pressure.
Marx was certainly a perceptive analyst of the nineteenth century’s version of globalization.
In the face of the difficulties of big automobile producers and smaller suppliers alike, many are demanding that, as part of the rescue package, the state should compel banks to lend. Everyone thinks of the horse that can be led to water, but cannot be made to drink.
In today’s circumstances, the financial system would have been better off if some version of US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s original plan to purchase toxic assets and take them off banks’ balance sheets had been realized.
But its acolytes should reflect on the uniformly disastrous results of centralized credit provision in the past.
Consider home ownership: while American conservatives say that the government’s attempt to extend home ownership to 70% of the US population was responsible for the financial meltdown, 87% of Mauritians own their own homes – without fueling a housing bubble.
During my visit, my interest was to understand better what had led to what some have called the Mauritius Miracle, and what others might learn from it.
This is not to say that Mauritius is without problems.
The US should now do right by this peaceful and democratic country: recognize Mauritius’ rightful ownership of Diego Garcia, renegotiate the lease, and redeem past sins by paying a fair amount for land that it has illegally occupied for decades.
The way that information circulates does reflect, as Howard argues, a conception of how a society/polity should be organized.
One of the Syrian government’s first moves after it began shooting protesters, for example, was to expel all foreign journalists.
The presumption should be that governments with nothing to hide have nothing to lose by allowing their citizens and internationally recognized media to report on their actions.
Anders Behring Breivik in Norway, Jared Lee Loughner in Arizona, Seung-Hui Cho in Virginia – the list of mass murderers defined according to their mental illnesses goes on.
A survey of the American public found that, while 68% of adults knew at least one person who had been hospitalized with a mental illness and 10% knew five or more people, only 9% had ever been threatened or physically harmed by such a person.
But it is more prevalent in developing countries than in the developed world.
While expanding the scope of mental-health services is a positive step, with the potential to contribute to the physical safety of US citizens, it is crucial that this link not be allowed to feed the perception that people with mental illnesses are dangerous.
Today we are fighting the first war in the era of e-mail, blogs, blackberries, instant messaging, digital cameras, the Internet, mobile phones, talk radio, and 24-hour news.
That false story incited deadly anti-American riots in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Free governments must make communications planning a central component of every aspect of this struggle.
This also will mean embracing new ways of engaging people throughout the world.
Inside the European Union, the ugly term PIGS (Portugal, Italy/Ireland, Greece, Spain) is now a commonplace, denoting countries that have endangered the euro’s stability and are forcing northern Europeans into costly bailouts.
As a result, their inability to reform, combined with rapid population growth and a rising cohort of young people, is placing them under pressure, creating a possibility of explosive change.
European officials in Brussels and the major EU governments should not go for political and economic half-measures.
MEXICO CITY – This month, Mexico’s Felipe Calderón celebrates his second anniversary as president.
He remains personally popular and well regarded, but the public is increasingly dissatisfied and disappointed with his government’s actual performance.
Mexico’s government and military had established a tacit, semi-violent, corrupt, but effective modus vivendi with the drug cartels since the early 1970’s.
Moreover, the capacity of Mexico’s security machinery appears diminished.
The Microfinance Catalyst
This type of disruptive innovation usually comes from entrepreneurs.
Within a few years, as their loan books began to grow rapidly, Compartamos and SKS created for-profit businesses that were owned by their respective NGOs.
For example, the Andhra Pradesh state government passed a restrictive ordinance making it difficult for microfinance institutions to recover their loans from their clients.
Up to now, the region (excluding Israel and Turkey) had more or less missed out on the epochal process of worldwide modernization.
Moreover, the situation was exacerbated by the incompetence of the region’s authoritarian regimes, which have been unable to provide their young people with any prospects beyond repression.
Moreover, compared to Eastern Europe in 1989, the Middle East in 2011 lacks any stabilizing external structures, such as NATO and the European Union, that could influence domestic reforms by holding out the prospect of membership.
Economic aid, the opening of the EU and US markets, strategic energy projects, legal and constitutional advice, and cooperation between universities are among the resources that the West must supply if it wants to contribute to the success of the Middle East’s democratic awakening.
Iran’s recent “election” saw blatant manipulation in favor of the incumbent president incite a democratic mass uprising.
Indeed, aside from matters of domestic policy and the issue of internal freedom, the choice between the major candidates hinges on the question of whether Iran should seek greater international integration. Ahmadinejad stands for a policy of confrontation and partial isolation; Moussavi stands for more openness.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now committed himself to a Palestinian state, and the Hamas leadership, which rejects Israel’s right to exist, has agreed to a Palestinian state within the borders prior to June 5, 1967.
The Middle East’s Democratic F-Words
The states in the Middle East can be characterized by a series of “F-words:” failed, frozen, flexible, flourishing, or frightening.
The small, emirates of the Gulf Cooperation Council are – with the exception of now tottering Dubai &#45;&#45; flourishing states that have joined the global economy through political and economic reform.
In Kuwait, another flourishing state, Wahabbi participation in parliament came only after permission was granted by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Bin Baz, and his successor, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh.
Unless sectarian politics are replaced by inclusiveness, all of the region’s “f-states” types of states will remain in a condition of prolonged turbulence.
One may object that to facilitate internal relocation is to collaborate with “ethnic or religious cleansing”; but the toll of prolonged war in Iraq, which could lead to its dismemberment anyway, is much worse.
As stability in the Middle East is essential to them, this is a matter of enlightened self-interest.
So it is smarter to go after the heroin bosses and their foreign networks, and in the meantime buy the poppy crop from farmers to destroy it.
The Israeli government and Palestinian political leaders are locked in a ruinous struggle, which merely aids extremists on both sides.
Some see war as a way of resolving an increasingly deadlocked situation, shaking up a dysfunctional regional order whose main actors are not only at loggerheads, but are also incapable of resolving the legitimacy deficits of their respective regimes.
Nor has he been able to rein in Iran’s relentless drive for regional hegemony, or convince it to abandon its quest for nuclear arms.
The assassinations – allegedly by Israel – of Imad Mughniyah, Hezbollah’s military chief and Iran’s closest ally in the organization, two years ago, and more recently of Mahmoud al-Mahbouh, Hamas’s liaison officer with the Al-Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, suggest that an unplanned chain of events could trigger a real war.
The Middle East’s Military Delusions
The moderates are in a daily battle with their own extremists, who claim that compromise is impossible.
Israelis and Palestinians came close to agreement on “land for peace” in the context of the Oslo peace process.
Israel refused even to negotiate with the Hamas-led Palestinian government, trying to squeeze it financially and make it capitulate.
Military reprisals will swell their ranks still further, and, until political grievances are addressed, the spread of democracy will not change that equation, because the extremists will win at the ballot box.
Turkey is genuinely interested in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and in a regional system of peace and security, whereas Iran and  Hezbollah are bent on derailing both in order to deny Israel the kind of peace with the Arab world that would end up isolating Iran.
Iran is working to ensure that free elections open the way to truly Islamic regimes in the Arab world, while Turkey assumes that its own political brand, a synthesis of Islam and democracy with secular values, should ultimately prevail.
It is on the Syrian question that the differences between Turkey and Iran are especially apparent.
And yet it is a question that obscures more than it illuminates.
And the former US ambassador James Jeffrey drew on Turkey’s experience, and the 1980 coup in particular, to argue that the military could help in “moderating Islamist movements.”
The loss of continuity in political parties, parliamentary procedures, and judicial processes encourages short-term calculation and spawns illiberal practices.
An entity that is authoritarian and hierarchical in nature cannot be relied on to protect and promote a democratic transition.
MADRID – The revolutions that swept the Arab world during the last two years have exposed the extraordinary fragility of key Arab states.
But the Kurds are hardly alone.
The rebels, mostly Sunnis assisted by jihadi groups such as the Nusra Front, an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq, have never truly attempted to reach out to the country’s minorities – Christians, Shia, Druze, and Kurds – which have repudiated the National Coalition as being “obedient to Turkey and Qatar.”
But there can be no doubt that the post-colonial status quo in the Middle East is crumbling.
That, too, is not surprising, because the situation remains an amorphous mix of hope and destruction.
Any such manifesto must address the two elephants in the room – Palestine and the price of oil – as well as the extent to which regional water and energy resources, now rapidly depleting, should be shared.
Communication may be instant, but, with no coherent animating ideology, the revolution proceeds in slow motion.
But boldness and adaptability do accord with Schumpeter’s emphasis on forming new combinations and doing things in new ways.
·        Cooperation with affiliate firms to reduce transaction costs in sourcing, capital acquisition, and contracts;
The great majority of the roughly 24 million private individuals estimated to have gone into business between 1980 and 2005 were ordinary folk with very small capital – usually obtained by pooling the savings of family members and perhaps friends.
Chinese entrepreneurs nowadays are particularly well adapted to take advantage of new market trends brought about by rapidly changing fashion and similarly rapid technological progress.
First, the data refer to those from 15 to 24 years old. But this age group consists of two sub-groups with very different characteristics.
Only 9% of Greek teenagers are labor-market participants; two-thirds of that number cannot find a job.
Europe has a general macroeconomic problem, owing to demand factors that interact with a rigid labor market, rather than a specific youth-unemployment problem.
The problem stems from how unemployment is measured: The adult unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals in the labor force.
Fortunately, there is a better methodology: The youth unemployment ratio – the number of unemployed youth relative to the total population aged 16-24 – is a far more meaningful indicator than the youth unemployment rate.
And, while some young people use higher education to escape a rocky job market, their choice to build new skills should not negatively impact perceptions of their country’s economic health.
Indeed, trust and confidence in scientific research have not been seriously undermined by reports of misconduct.
Science means constantly walking a tightrope between blind faith and curiosity; between expertise and creativity; between bias and openness; between experience and epiphany; between ambition and passion; and between arrogance and conviction – in short, between an old today and a new tomorrow.
Like the previous generation, many gifted young researchers know that they must work hard to meet monumental challenges and make valuable contributions to society.
The WEO’s prediction of a strengthening recovery this year continues the misdiagnosis.
In 2012, world trade expanded by only 2.5%, while global GDP grew at a disappointing 3.2% rate.
Like the advanced economies, emerging economies experienced a boom in 2000-2007.
In Europe, the banks’ wounds must be closed – weak banks must be shut down or merged with stronger banks – before recovery can begin.
There are also concerns over excessive debt and related fears of a fragile banking system; worries about the ever-present property bubble collapsing; and, most important, the presumed lack of meaningful progress on economic rebalancing – the long-awaited shift from a lopsided export- and investment-led growth model to one driven by internal private consumption.
It takes strategy, time, and determination to pull it off.
These developments – first convergence, and now faster services growth – stand in sharp contrast with earlier trends.
Second, greater reliance on services allows China to settle into a lower and more sustainable growth trajectory, tempering the excessive resource- and pollution-intensive activities driven by the hyper-growth of manufacturing and construction.
The advance of knowledge is often a mixed blessing.
But as the science improves, the insurance problem will have to be faced.
For many parents, nothing is more important than giving their child the best possible start in life.
Something similar could happen with other forms of genetic selection.
PRINCETON – When Radosław Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, went to Ukraine for talks last month, his Ukrainian counterparts reportedly laughed at him because he was wearing a Japanese quartz watch that cost only $165.
Out of nostalgia, perhaps? A full-page ad for Patek Philippe has Thierry Stern, the president of the company, saying that he listens to the chime of every watch with a minute repeater that his company makes, as his father and grandfather did before him.
The Chinese government knows what those “other ways” might be.
If I were not ignorant, I would know that children are dying from diarrhea or malaria, because they lack safe drinking water, or mosquito nets, and obviously what I have spent on this watch or handbag would have been enough to help several of them survive; but I care so little about them that I would rather spend my money on something that I wear for ostentation alone.”
It is morally better to have our goods supplied by free labor than by slaves, and to choose our goods rather than have them chosen for us by the state.
Adam Smith wrote that “consumption is the sole end and purpose of production.”
No doubt it is unfair to blame the market for bad moral choices.
Justice in distribution is supposedly secured by justice in exchange.
The market system does not guarantee this.
European governments are adamantly opposed to capital punishment – the European Union bans it outright – and some Europeans consider its use in the United States barbaric.
But, even with the limited quantitative evidence available, there are good reasons to believe that capital punishment deters.
Yet that is absolutely the wrong conclusion for anyone who believes that capital punishment deters.
Suppose it would be possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing such a criminal.
Of course, I worry about the risk of executing the innocent.
India, Pakistan, and Israel refused to join the treaty and, over time, constructed their own atomic bombs.
The successful cheaters would most likely be authoritarian states with little transparency.
The treaty helps them to reduce fears of cheating by neighbors because it provides for inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
But this assumes perfect rationality.
Such conditions do not yet exist in a world where undemocratic states cheat on legal obligations. But the nuclear weapons states should continue to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, and refrain from new programs that suggest the prospect of their use.
What is a paradise for political scientists is a nightmare for anyone trying to rule the country in earnest.
Right and Left swapped seniority around a barely-existent central pole.
It will not die any time soon: in the Israeli aviary both doves and hawks are capable phoenixes.
Tel Aviv, who voted Livni and Left of her, should finally be able to stand up to Jerusalem, who voted Netanyahu and Right of him. This election may sound a wake-up call to the moderates, and Livni is their tested leader.
Fewer choices are sometimes the hallmark of maturity, and not only in politics.
WASHINGTON, DC – Opposition to plans to build a mosque near “Ground Zero,” the spot where the World Trade Center’s twin towers fell on September 11, 2001, comes in various shades.
A majority considered them offensive, and therefore expected interracial couples to show what is demanded today from Muslims in Manhattan: respect for other people’s sensitivities. In a nation of laws, such as the US, it is disingenuous and unfair to grant legal protection to a right – in this case the right to worship God as we see fit – and then selectively ban its exercise de facto because a majority or minority takes offense.
The real problem, however, lies elsewhere.
The other option – that US policy was in the terrorists’ crosshairs – is too upsetting for these opponents to contemplate.
Although the electoral fraud in Managua was the most widely documented, the same modus operandi occurred across the country, affecting more than 40 municipalities.
And the international community, which provides almost a third of the resources needed to make the country work, is being alienated.
Last month, the Supreme Court of Justice acquitted Alemán of the corruption charges that had sent him to prison for 20 years.
Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has a state that considers itself a leader of the Arab Muslim peoples backed Israel so openly.
These tensions further receded in the tide of the “Islamization” created by the Iranian revolution, for in its wake Arabs’ sectarian identity as Sunni was pushed further into the background as a generalized “Islamic” assertiveness appeared.
Israel, the once implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to be slotted into this defensive structure.
The Court must answer the following question: Can human genes – your genes – be patented? Put another way, should someone essentially be permitted to own the right, say, to test whether you have a set of genes that imply a higher than 50% probability of developing breast cancer?
Normally, economists talk about trade-offs: weaker intellectual-property rights, it is argued, would undermine incentives to innovate.
And it is why research shows that patenting genes actually reduces the production of new knowledge about genes: the most important input in the production of new knowledge is prior knowledge, to which patents inhibit access.
The WTO’s intellectual-property agreement, called TRIPS, originally foresaw the extension of “flexibilities” to the 48 least-developed countries, where average annual per capita income is below $800.
The Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and the Karmapa Lama are the three highest figures in Tibetan Buddhism, representing parallel institutions that have intermittently been at odds with each other throughout their history.
In fact, the Chinese-appointed Karmapa Lama has a doppelgänger Karmapa, who has set up shop in New Delhi.
China had several possible motives for staging his “escape,” including a desire to strengthen his claim to the title at a time when the rival contender (backed by important interests in India, Bhutan, and Taiwan) appeared to be gaining ground.
Nevertheless, China has refrained from attacking him, making clear that it wants him to return eventually.
The results suggest that religious and national identities are complementary, not competing, concepts.
Some may look to unpopular and unjust foreign adventures in Iraq as examples of the futility of lawful political action.
Islam’s interaction with European society sparked a flowering of knowledge, and large numbers of Muslims have inhabited the Balkans and eastern and central Europe for hundreds of years.
Any claim like that will inevitably attract attention.
But what do these arguments really mean for the outlook for investments in homes in superstar cities?
But they tend to be ingenious at developing glamorous new areas from little towns within an hour’s commute from major cities.
Finally, as Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai themselves note, even these small long-term differences in home price across cities have tended to be offset by lower rent-price ratios in the superstar cities.
A leading critic of the Kremlin and several others were hastily dragged into a police car and driven away.
For every authoritarian country that has managed to grow rapidly, there are several that have floundered.
At first sight, China seems to be an exception.
During his first term in office, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan relaxed some restrictions on Kurdish minorities and passed reforms that aligned the country’s legal regime with European norms.
And South Africa suffers from a shockingly high level of unemployment.
Bo’s rise to power owed much to his pedigree (his father was a vice premier), his political patrons, and his manipulation of the rules of the game. For example, visitors to Chongqing marvel at the soaring skyscrapers and modern infrastructure built during Bo’s tenure there.
Another common measure used to judge a Chinese official’s “merit” is his ability to deliver economic growth.
For those without guanxi, the only recourse is to purchase appointments and promotions through bribes.
In today’s inter-connected global economy, uncertainty about the US economic outlook increases one day, and Dutch consumer confidence, for example, takes a tumble the next.
It has an indirect effect on European exports to Asia, which can be sizeable because the US market is so important for Asian exports.
By pumping in whatever liquidity the financial sector needs to alleviate the credit crunch, the ECB is effectively maintaining a deflationary bias for the financial sector, whereas it has announced an inflationary bias for the rest of the economy.
But ordinary Europeans should not be fooled.
This shift is hardly surprising, given the increasing number of analyses that demonstrate that current – unilateral – climate policies will have virtually no impact on the rise in global temperature.
Such measures even include bans on light bulbs and patio heaters, tax breaks for bicycle owners, standards for tire pressure, and tests for fuel-efficient driving – none of which would appear to have much impact on the level of Russian or Middle Eastern oil imports.
It is worth noting that these outcomes are based on the optimistic reference scenario used in the US Department of Energy’s International Energy Outlook, under which renewable-energy use will grow at a higher rate than in the past.
Confronted by economic decline and rising unemployment, governments are much more likely to pay attention to domestic pressure groups than to upholding their international obligations.
Taken at face value, it seems to suggest that governments have all but abandoned their commitments to the World Trade Organization and the multilateral trade regime.
The tariff is fully consistent with a special arrangement negotiated at the time of China’s accession to the WTO, which allows the US to impose temporary protection when its markets are “disrupted” by Chinese exports.
But economists’ ideas would not have gone very far without significant changes in the underlying configuration of political interests in favor of open trade.
Unfortunately, there is little to suggest that policymakers are yet ready to confront this genuine threat.
To the extent that the Bush administration has a coherent philosophy for domestic policy, it is the idea of the “ownership society” – the belief that intermediary institutions, whether governments, unions, or the benefits departments of companies, should get out of the business of providing social insurance.
It also has people who do set up 401(k) accounts and then invest them badly – for example, Enron workers whose 401(k) money was overwhelmingly invested in company stock lost not only their jobs when the company went bankrupt, but also their pension assets.
The Myth of the Shia Crescent
Recent developments in Iraq allegedly point to a fundamental clash between Sunnis and Shiites in the region and bear witness to malevolent Iranian interferences.
Here is where Sunni-Shiite cooperation comes in.
Memories of Iraq’s eight year war of aggression against Iran in the 1980’s have not faded.
Continuous talk of a “Sunni-Shia divide” might ultimately develop into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Some issues that Europe’s decision-makers have wanted to keep under the carpet have now been rudely exposed.
But can an absence of clarity about the ECB’s voting arrangements last forever? Nout Wellink of the Dutch Central Bank has explicitly said that more disclosure would one day be needed as the ECB reaches maturity.
It is the monetary authority of a federation of sovereign states.
That could matter a lot in relation to interest-rate decisions.
And the ECB’s voting arrangements are one further element in need of reform.
For example, in a paper presented last spring at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, James Stock of Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University unveiled a new “dynamic factor model,” estimated using data from 1959 to 2011.
But connections between countries do not occur solely through the direct impact of market prices.
That story might have invited some gossip outside of Greece, but it gained little purchase on international attention until the end of 2009, when the market for Greek debt started to become increasingly unsettled, with rising interest rates causing further problems for the government.
Then as now, we will not be able to understand the world economic outlook fully without considering the story on people’s minds.
Liberia’s post-conflict recovery is not unprecedented, but it provides a clear illustration of how coordinated and sustained multilateral support can help national leaders deliver impressive results.
Debt relief will open doors for the financing of critical projects in electric power, roads, and ports.
The Nation State Revisited
Many countries are currently debating the integration of migrants.
More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground, the revival of national protectionism.
Such trends are dangerous.
But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others.
With advanced economies struggling to avoid financial collapse, escape recession, reduce unemployment, and restore growth, central banks are being called upon to address, sometimes simultaneously, growing imbalances.
Moreover, by pushing interest rates toward zero, the current policy of quantitative easing (increasing money supply by buying government securities) has strong, often regressive, income effects.
But this advantage does not extend to other policy areas.
The biggest challenge is that people do not always get the healthcare they need.
A Mexican survey shows that in private care, poor patients (particularly indigenous women) receive worse care than the wealthy, although there is little difference in public institutions.
Mexico has chosen a targeted insurance scheme for households that are not covered by social security scheme and are too poor to afford private insurance.
But, while an expensive campaign to combat a particularly dangerous, communicable disease like HIV/AIDS makes sense, it is less clear that this approach works well when aimed at providing the public with general, health-related information.
Even without detailed cost-benefit analysis, it is clear that universal insurance coverage is vital.
Moreover, only a small portion of the liquidity created by unconventional monetary policy has been channeled toward households and the small and medium-size enterprises that generate most new jobs.
Furthermore, the effect of internationally agreed regulatory reforms – most of which have yet to be implemented – will be to increase banks’ capital requirements while shrinking the scale of maturity transformation risks that they can carry on their balance sheets.
Such an approach is the only way to place the global economy’s recovery on a sustainable footing.
This has been the purpose of the vast bank bailouts in the US and Europe, followed by several rounds of “quantitative easing,” by which central banks print money and pump it into the banking system through a variety of unorthodox channels.
So the question arises: Why did people want to borrow so much? Why did the ratio of household debt to income soar to unprecedented heights in the pre-recession days?
Of course, some worried about the collapse of the household savings rate, but few were overly concerned.
Concerted redistribution of wealth and income has frequently been essential to the long-term survival of capitalism.
China, which has never adopted legally binding limits on its nuclear weapons or strategic nuclear-delivery vehicles, rejects Russia’s call to join negotiations – a stance that the US supports until the Russian and US nuclear arsenals move closer in size to those of China.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to initiating a trilateral dialogue is Chinese resistance to formal nuclear arms-control agreements, which is rooted in the memory of Cold War-era nonproliferation initiatives aimed partly at preventing China from developing its own nuclear deterrent.
With Russia ostensibly on board, it is up to the US to initiate a transformation in the nuclear-negotiation framework – and that means convincing China to participate.
Turkey’s government was no better at anticipating the changes in the Arab world than were local regimes and Western powers.
This time, however, it is modernity, not exoticism, that is the source of fascination.
Turkey is also much less worried about its future than Israel is.
Turkey is for Europe, beyond its demography, “a principle of energy” and a cure for pessimism – even if, as Erdoğan is showing, self-confidence can easily turn into hubris.
From 17th c. onwards often applied to delusive commercial or financial schemes.”
That seems to be the core of the meaning of the word as it is most consistently used.
It would seem more accurate to refer to these episodes as speculative epidemics.
The New Age Divide
At the same time, people are living longer, so that in a generation the number of elderly dependents in some countries will outgrow that of the young.
It took radio 38 years to reach an audience of 50 million. Facebook did that in two years.
But continuing to use energy inefficiently will not mitigate the painful effects of the global economic crisis.
This year’s task may be to reach a global understanding in Copenhagen that is not too prescriptive, but which is more than aspirational and into which an American domestic political agreement can be incorporated once Obama achieves it.
According to Morgan Stanley, SWF’s are expected to manage $12 trillion by 2015, up from about $2.5 trillion today.
So central banks are transferring their excess reserves to existing or newly created SWF’s, which in turn invest in high-return equities.
Some worry about reciprocity: if Chinese firms are allowed to invest in US and EU firms, shouldn’t US and EU firms be allowed to invest freely in any Chinese firm?
SWF’s are, it seems, here to stay and grow, and they do offer significant benefits.
Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom and make their own way.”
To explain what is wrong with the new Bush doctrine, I have to invoke the concept of open society.
This has left the US not only deeply divided, but also at loggerheads with much of the rest of the world, which considers our policies high-handed and arbitrary.
America cannot do whatever it wants, as the Iraqi debacle has demonstrated; but, at the same time, nothing much can be achieved in the way of international cooperation without US leadership, or at least active participation.
As the head of the PBOC, he has favored more market-based monetary policies and increased internationalization of China’s currency, the renminbi.
He has recently been promoted to the post of Deputy Director of the National Development and Reform Commission, the principal body that advises the State Council on economic-development strategy and macroeconomic policy.
If China wanted to continue to invest in foreign businesses and natural resources, it would have to become a net seller of bonds from its portfolio.
I was at a dinner the other night with Yale World Fellows, a carefully selected group of professionals, representing every major country of the world, who spend a semester here.
When Merton engaged people in conversation, any topic would remind the cosmopolitan influentials of the world at large, while local influentials were reminded of things in their own town.
What I find particularly striking is the sense of loyalty developing among cosmopolitans.
The cosmopolitans have shared experiences: they are directly communicating with each other across the globe.
The New Face of the United Nations
This balanced approach is important because most of the world’s hotspots are in trouble not only, or even mainly, because of politics, but because of the underlying challenges of hunger, disease, and environmental crisis.
Three treaties emerged in 1992 out of the so-called Rio Conference on the Environment – on climate change, biodiversity conservation, and desertification.
If the United States works more closely within the UN framework, it will find willing partners in the rising Asian powers, which are intent on using their influence and resources to solve today’s challenges.
The hijab, the headscarf that some Muslim women wear, is already banned in French public schools, where the “ostentatious” display of any religious symbolism is forbidden.
Aside from the fact that more serious issues face the French government than the sartorial habits of a small number of women, there is the matter of individual freedom.
The Egyptian imam, Sheikh Mohammed Tantawi, wants to ban the wearing of face-covering veils in Egyptian schools. But this is still no reason why French women should not be allowed to enter a post office, a bank, a school, or any other public place in a burqa.
But one can impose dress codes for certain jobs, without banning a type of clothing for everyone.
All we see, as she looks out of the window, are her eyes, nicely framed in mascara.
But, regardless of how these immediate challenges are resolved, it is clear that the world economy is entering a difficult new longer-term phase as well – one that will be substantially less hospitable to economic growth than possibly any other period since the end of World War II.
It is an environment that will produce deep disparities in economic performance around the world.
But they have not prevented a borrowing binge in their private sectors.
But they provide the arenas of consultation, cooperation, and give-and-take among opposing social groups that are crucial in times of turbulence and shocks.
There are, of course, specific, identifiable dangers, but what worries us most about terrorism, for example, is its unpredictable nature.
This is the context of our current peculiar vulnerability. What used to protect us (distance, government intervention, foresight, classic defense methods) has been weakened, and now offers little or no protection.
We cannot continue to pursue strategies that ignore our common exposure to global risks, and the resulting environment of mutual dependence.
More concessional finance will be available for low-income countries, and international liquidity will be increased by a hand-out of $ 250 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs).
The ‘new’ IMF should be an institution that communicates better with its members, balances the interests of its advanced, emerging and developing members in an evenhanded manner, and aligns its policies better to the needs of the moment.
First, the US saving deficit will need to be addressed in a sustainable manner.
The rapid growth of China, India, and other emerging countries should come with increased influence, to be implemented through the planned quota increase in 2011.
This regional realignment is typified by the emergence of a de facto alliance that dare not speak its name.
Since the Wahhabis consider the Shi’a apostates, the challenge from the Shi’a – both within and without Saudi Arabia – represents a mortal threat.
This leads to an unavoidable dilemma: Bush will have to choose between supporting democracy and backing those who want to fight Islamic radicalism.
One is to have an international conference at which experts can suggest models to calculate exchange rates and politicians can negotiate deals.
There have been two models for such a consensus.
Many Europeans tried to argue in recent years that monetary policy should also take asset-price developments into account, whereas American policymakers and academics largely resisted this approach.
But, from an early stage, the transparency that resulted from the early publication of who voted for and against rate increases led to a public identification of members of the Committee as hawks or doves.
And nowhere does this seem truer than in Latin America.
India is showing keen interest in the region’s energy industry, and has signed export agreements in the defense sector.
The US not only encouraged these changes, but has benefited hugely from them.
Trade relations provide another all-important lever.
But which issues will dominate 2013? In no small part, as the French are fond of saying, plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.
Civil war along sectarian lines could well predominate, or fighting between the various anti-Assad opposition groups could erupt.
At the same time, sanctions that have been imposed by a substantial set of countries are taking a significant toll on the Iranian economy.
The New Public Diplomacy
Skeptics who treat the term “public diplomacy” as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point.
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels.
The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda.
The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.
In the United States, big bonuses given to executives from firms receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts – the insurance giant AIG, in particular – has infuriated public opinion, with a populist press and Congress fueling popular rage.
But it seems obvious that increasing economic inequality in the US and, indeed, throughout the OECD, has stoked a perception of injustice and growing anger.
This sense of injustice is only partly contained by political considerations in the US, thanks to the “Obama factor,” a rare phenomenon that can be described as the restoration of trust in one’s political leaders.
WASHINGTON, DC – Senator Barack Obama’s recent European tour hints that the Illinois senator is Europe’s choice to be America’s next president.
In other words, from this perspective, the world’s two richest and most powerful economic spaces, the European Union and the US, are bound to be rivals, even when they are allies.
While America’s invasion of Afghanistan was widely seen as justified, the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq produced an open break between the US and its two major continental allies, France and Germany, which were supported by Russia and China.
It is difficult to know where this uneasy transatlantic détente of 2008 will lead.
Of course, America’s definitions of its role in the world may change.
That Europe can find the will, the means, and the confidence to play that role cannot be taken for granted.
Have the British, French, and even Israelis become armed extensions of the US in their respective spheres of influence?
Is it worth fighting for a world that cannot be saved, and that only invites murky, inconclusive entanglements?
Likewise, delegating security to allies can have perverse psychological effects.
The Measurement of Hope
Though I am an optimist, I am not blind to the problems that we face, or to the challenges that we must overcome to accelerate progress in the next 15 years.
Unless voters hear about the positive impact that their generosity is having, they will inevitably focus on issues closer to home.
The MDGs were coherent because they focused on helping the poorest people in the world.
The information revolution is transforming politics and organizations.
Sometimes people are attracted to others with command power by myths of invincibility.
Certainly, the hard power of military and police force was necessary to counter al-Qaeda, but the indiscriminate use of hard power – illustrated by the invasion of Iraq, the Abu Ghraib prison photos, and detentions without trial – served to increase the number of terrorist recruits.
Indeed, psychologists have found that too much assertiveness by a leader worsens relationships, just as too little limits achievement.
And, in an age of flatter hierarchies and empowered knowledge workers, soft power is likely to increase in importance.
The Bush administration has finally come around to doing what every economist urged it to do: put more equity into the banks.
Remarkable as it may seem, America, for all its problems, is still seen as the safest place to put one’s money.
At the time, many thought that such lofty appeals were a deliberate attempt to forestall real reform: those who had done well under the old system knew that the crisis would pass, and with it, so too would the demand for reform.
The Next IMF
The IMF’s management shares many strategic considerations repeatedly raised by the Bundesbank, which has argued that the Fund should limit its activities to its core mandate: promoting monetary and financial stability.
Indeed, the implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief initiated by the G-8 already provides an unprecedented opportunity to complete the process of debt relief for a large number of low-income countries.
This argument is based on the idea that business does not like change, and in particular does not like change brought about by government policy or regulation.
New businesses are already emerging all over the world, focused on low-carbon solutions to energy generation and use, from light bulbs to transport, but they are still at the pioneering stage.
2.      A clear commitment to the global pricing of carbon that allows businesses to invest with confidence and at the scale required.
Dwight D. Eisenhower invited Nikita Khrushchev to the United States in 1959 to open the eyes of the first Soviet leader ever to visit America.
The US should press for bilateral talks. One lesson provided by former American presidents is the value of direct, high-level contacts with key adversaries.
These parallel steps would reshape the process to achieve a key US objective: ensuring that Iran abides by Khamenei’s own fatwa (religious decree) against nuclear weapons.
To organize discussion of these broader issues, the US and others should explore the possibility of appointing a special envoy – perhaps a former Chief of State under UN auspices – to engage Iran in new ways.
From today’s perspective, the problems of the Nixon era look relatively manageable, even trivial.
Germany was more obliging in the face of US pressure, mainly because its security relied on America’s military presence.
What can they do?”
After an initial inflationary surge, American economic growth fell off sharply in the 1970’s.
Instead of leading to an American renaissance, the “Nixon shock” produced theories about American imperial overstretch and decline.
But, from the start, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the physics and chemistry prizes, and the Caroline Institute, which awards those for medicine/physiology, have based their decisions on the recommendations of their respective committees.
Conversely, the Academy of Sciences sometimes rebelled against its committees.
The Nobel bylaws do not allow splitting a prize into more than three parts, thereby excluding discoveries that entailed work by more than three researchers, or omitting key persons who equally deserved to share in the honor.
Is science or society well served by a fixation on prizes and on nurturing a culture of extreme competition? Perhaps once the mystery of the Nobel Prize is reduced, we might reflect on what is truly significant in science.
A worldwide effort is needed to understand changes in all parts of the world.
The IPCC faced down these vested interests.
Second, we should initiate IPCC-like scientific processes for other global challenges, including the global loss of biodiversity, desertification, and over-fishing of the oceans.
Nothing extraordinary has been revealed, but the cables now available allow readers and analysts to draw some preliminary conclusions about the Obama administration’s views of the region; about Latin American leaders’ attitudes toward the United States; and about the quality of US diplomatic and intelligence-gathering activities in the hemisphere.
Another good example of interesting and competent reporting lies in the cable sent from La Paz, Bolivia on March 30, 2006, by Ambassador David Greenlee, highlighting the tensions between the Cuban and Venezuelan advisers and security personnel surrounding President Evo Morales, as well as the circles of elites around him.
He then describes the utter lack of cooperation between intelligence agencies and the military, because many US and Mexican officials fear that whatever information they share with the army will be handed over to the cartels.
Nigeria, which is giving Taylor sanctuary, is obliged to turn him over to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, created by the United Nations in 2003 to prosecute those responsible for the bloodletting in West Africa’s in the 1990’s.
The women and children whose limbs Taylor ordered to be hacked off bear testimony to his brutality, and the countries left in turmoil make clear that there can be no durable peace in West Africa unless the man who unleashed these conflicts is stopped.
The best containment strategy is to put Taylor in the custody of the Special Court that indicted him in 2003 for war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the war in Sierra Leone.
Its just concluded sixth congress was held for the first time in the occupied territories, which meant that former guerrillas from Lebanon and Jordan were allowed entry by Israel.
Backroom decisions and top-down guidance was replaced by a democratic free-for-all that saw many of Fatah’s historic leaders fall to the wayside, making room for younger, locally popular leaders.
Some are calling for Fatah leaders to abstain from ministerial roles, whereas others see no reason why one can’t be a leader of a party and the government simultaneously.
Nevertheless, the results of the Sixth Fatah Congress reflect a clear bias in favor of becoming a party rather than an armed resistance movement.
The recent WikiLeaks disclosures of classified American diplomatic documents, for example, suggest that North Korea has been helping Iran with its advanced missile program.
Starting from similar levels a half-century ago, South Korea has grown to become one of the world’s most prosperous economies, with nearly 50 million people enjoying a per capita income of $30,000 (at purchasing price parity).
China has tried to persuade Kim’s regime to follow its market-oriented example, but Kim is afraid that an economic opening would lead to a political opening and loss of dictatorial control.
If so, the risky behavior we have seen recently is part of the process of solidifying a unique political system: a hereditary Communist monarchy.
The nature and content of that treaty were purely diplomatic.
But Antarctica had one great advantage, as compared to the Arctic, which is now in peril: there were only penguins in Antarctica, not voters, especially voters of different nationalities.
This poses a real threat to the Eskimo and Inuit populations, as well as to polar bears.
The good news for Ban Ki-moon is that he has become Secretary General of the United Nations at a time when the prospects for conflict between or among the world’s great powers – the United States, China, Japan, Russia, Europe, and India – are remote.
When they are willing and able to do so, the UN can make a difference; when they are not, the UN can act in only the most limited way, if at all, regardless of what the Secretary General wants.
Again, what is holding the UN back is not the UN itself, but its leading members, who cannot agree on what change is needed.
All these suggestions highlight what might be any secretary general’s most important asset: his voice.
Syria’s Chemical Genie
Fortunately, Syria does not face these threats today. But Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran – all potentially unstable countries with growing nuclear enterprises – may in the future.
The United States, which has become the world’s leader in containing the chemical-weapons risk, seems befuddled.
But, to rely on the US government alone to plot the most effective strategy in the shadow of possible internal group-think is asking too much.
But the emerging Obama doctrine suggests that “elections alone do not make true democracy,” and that, as has been the case in the Arab world, any abrupt move to democracy is bound to produce chaos.
Why should the West insist on elections in a country that since 1984 was ruled by a Western-backed dictator, Lansana Conté, who himself came to power in a military coup? He maintained a constitution, and held elections, but this did not make him a democratic ruler, nor was he able to extricate his country from appalling backwardness despite its tremendous potential for economic development.
For as it does, China is using its colossal financial firepower to expand its strategic position on the continent, without linking aid and investment to pesky demands for good governance.
Are they right?
His worldview was shaped by the fact that he spent part of his youth in Indonesia and had an African father.
This was demonstrated by his appointments of experienced advisers, careful management of issues, and above all, keen contextual intelligence.
Obama has not bent the arc of history in the transformational way to which he aspired in his campaign four years ago, but his shift to a pragmatic approach may turn out to be a good thing, particularly if voters continue to have doubts about the economy.
How is it that America gives us Silicon Valley wizardry and Third World infrastructure?
House prices remain pretty flat.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown is sustained in office primarily by the calculation of his ministers that getting rid of him would trigger an early election that they would lose heavily.
First, what happens if politics does not trump economics, and Obama’s policies don’t start to produce a recovery? That is when the old political calculus may take its grim toll.
The world needs one. But it needs one who continues to shine brightly for several years to come.
More than anything else, his success in this domain will determine the perception of his administration.
This means that he will have to deal with a large number of threats, vulnerabilities, and independent actors who may resist bending to America’s will.
Once the fighting between Israel and Hamas subsides, the question of what the Arab states will do to strengthen Palestinian moderates and to make peace with Israel is sure to arise.
But, as we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, we should ask ourselves: is it really wise to accord such importance to growth?
Thus, policies that promote individual well-being tend to benefit society as well.
Many questions remain unexplored, some studies lack sufficient confirmatory evidence, and still others, like those involving the effects of economic growth, have yielded conflicting results.
Annual GDP growth in the first quarter has been revised upward, to 4.1%, exceeding market expectations and providing a strong indication that the Japanese economy is finally recovering, after two decades of stagnation.

In particular, there was a sudden increase in exports via the free-trade zone in Guangdong.
The US economy’s road to recovery is being built on the shale-gas revolution, a revived manufacturing sector, and a decline in the US budget deficit in GDP terms.
As more of China’s population converges to Western standards of consumption, demand for commodities – and thus their prices – will remain on an upward trajectory.
There is also the issue of the so-called reserve price (the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service).
Around the world, governments are taking greater control of resources and imposing policies that hamper global production and ultimately force prices higher.
A New Greek Test for Europe
The hope was that the Greeks would ultimately bear their own burden.
Some analysts argue that, given guarantees of debt incurred by public corporations, the Greek government’s obligations are even higher.
Despite domestic opposition, German Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to commit to keeping Greece in the eurozone, because the risk that a Greek exit would precipitate the monetary union’s disintegration was deemed too great.
The Europe that emerges from it could look, for better or worse, very different from the Europe of today.
Today, some community college students have to quit school because their textbooks cost more than their tuition; and today, some third graders have to share math texts because there aren’t enough to go around.
The new development and distribution models promoted by the Open Education movement represent a natural and inevitable evolution of the educational publishing industry.
Together, we can help make the dream of Open Education a reality.
Think of the productivity cost of millions like him having to adjust to a new system.
Why buy a Windows machine when all your colleagues will own Macintoshes and can help you on them but not Windows, and when all the independent software developers will be programming for the Mac’s new Leopard operating system?
After all, even though Microsoft has a monopoly of primary sales of its software, copies sold in 2007 compete with those sold in 2006.
The Opportunity in Seoul
There are already some serious signs of distress – the currency war between the United States and China, and its spread to other countries, being a case in point.
Thus, the first task for the G-20 meeting on November 11-12 in Seoul must be to revitalize and strengthen the IMF and global financial regulation.
These two issues may or may not be on the table for further discussion in Seoul.
After five years of an average annual economic growth of 9%, economic claims are strikingly absent, as are all socialist and even social demands.
Ordinary Ukrainians aspire to law and order; businessmen want their playing field to be leveled with the richest and most well connected.
Ukraine has little choice but to turn to Europe and the West.
Otherwise, financial destabilization will threaten the fortunes of the very rich.
The Algerian Tragedy
Algeria was the first Arab Spring country.
But opposition figures, former Algerian intelligence officers, and diplomats accused the military of being complicit or even directly responsible for others.
AQI not only failed to embed itself in the local context, but had begun eliminating local opponents, fueling a revolt against it by Sunni militias in 2007.
But this picture, based on Africa’s most corrupt regimes, is unfair and misleading – like claiming that all Europeans are guilty of “ethnic cleansing” because of what happened in the former Yugoslavia.
We look at almost a hundred indicators and define governance in a new way – as the public goods and services that should be provided to citizens.
Africa, with its huge and often untapped markets, must follow the same path.
Moreover, while the international community is quick to pounce on African leaders for governance failures, it seems less enthusiastic about examining its role in the flight of African assets.
But those problems should not be allowed to obscure the continent’s many success stories – much less to be defined as Africa’s alone.
The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day increased from 549 million in 1981 to 595 million in 2005.
The leading regions have experienced rapid growth.
What can be done? There is no universal “fix” in economic development, and pluralism of approaches has great value.
For example, the gains from labor mobility have not been equally sharedbetween educated and uneducated migrants.
First, empirical evidence shows that convergence of per capita income between lagging and leading regions is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for achieving poverty reduction and social convergence.
Although the two youthful revolts were undertaken by the same generation and took similar forms of street demonstrations and sit-ins, there were far more differences than similarities as students rebelled on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
That same spring, demonstrators in Paris burned cars in opposition to the bourgeois lifestyle.
In violation of a centuries-long tradition of university autonomy, the police marched onto campus, beat up students, and arrested a large number of demonstrators.
After 1968, Western student protestors gradually entered their countries’ political and intellectual establishments.
The Solidarity movement of the 1980’s and the peaceful overthrow of communism was, in large measure, the work of their generation.
Palestinian negotiators have always had to balance three issues: historic rights, current realities, and the price of using their negative power.
They argue that the positions acceptable in Taba (following the failure of Camp David II) must be the basis of any agreement, and that what needs to be negotiated now is the timetable for implementation.
But now it is time for a clear-eyed assessment of what lies before Palestinians, Israelis, and, perhaps more importantly, for the wider Arab world.
Indeed, Abbas is now the only Arab leader who came to power in a more or less free election.
The Palestinians have shown that it is not true that an Arab society cannot progress towards representative institutions.
A ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Court issued on May 11 gutted much of the lustration law, and made Germek’s position in the EU parliament safe – at least for now.
Solidarity adopted a philosophy of compromise rather than revenge, and embraced the idea of a Poland for everyone rather than a state divided between omnipotent winners and oppressed losers.
The Solidarity workers at giant enterprises have become victims of the freedoms they won.
The means chosen by these losers’ parties after they won the general election of 2005 was a great purge.
If a hunt for agents had been organized in 1990 when the democratic revolution began, neither Leszek Balcerowicz’s economic reforms nor the establishment of a state governed by law would have been possible.
It is time for Europe to adjust the way that it thinks about nationality, cultural roots, and how it deals with immigrants.
I suppose that I belong to an expat generation that has not been educated to consider voting an essential right, if not a duty, and I regret that.
Among his achievements is a Citizens’ Charter that is handed to every new resident to explain Swiss participatory democracy and lay out its rules.
The Prion Puzzle
The resulting epizootic (animal epidemic) affected more than 280,000 cows.
Since then, “new variant” Creutzfeltdt-Jakob disease has claimed roughly 300 lives.
Moreover, there is hope that an effective vaccination can be developed.
Using recently developed “zinc finger nuclease” technology, any given gene can be removed from an animal’s DNA.
While even a shrewd economist like the former US Federal Reserve Board member Alan Blinder thought this, it is not likely for several reasons, both “natural” and manmade.
Thus, foreign radiologists need US certification before they are allowed to read the x-rays sent from the US. Until recently, only two foreign firms qualified.
Senator Barbara Boxer railed continually against Carly Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, that she had exported 35,000 jobs. The obvious reply should have been: “Yes, I outsourced 30,000 jobs.
New York – The selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain’s running mate hit the United States like an electric storm.
Their more affluent peers hire women like them to do the dirty work, or else they have had to deal with stagnant minimum-wage pay in the US labor market’s “pink-collar” or service-industry ghetto.
When you’ve been making the coffee forever, it’s nice to imagine leading the free world.
In becoming the poster girl for a re-branded continuation of the Bush administration, Palin is showing herself to have much in common with glossy faux-populists like Eva Peron or Denmark’s anti-immigrant leader Pia Kjærsgaard.
There seemed every chance that he would apply this approach to the choice of his running mate.
Questions about her record have been sidestepped; her inexperience is lauded as a virtue; any criticism is dismissed as sexism.
He was arguing as Wall Street went into meltdown that the American economy’s fundamentals were still strong.
His opponent originally derided what has rapidly become the conventional wisdom.
What struck me, thinking back to the days I once spent in Northern Ireland, was how both there and here the crucible of so much struggle, bitterness, and bloodshed is very small.  There is an intimacy about the geography of Northern Ireland, Gaza, and the West Bank that makes the violence seem all the more inexplicable and obscene.
This was not a matter of theology or even liturgy.
The result of that deal has been years of peace.
So did I think of lessons to be learned in the Middle East as I drove from one end of Jordan to the other?
These studies led to the suggestion that the use of paracetamol may represent an important risk factor in the development of asthma.
This suggests that the potential effect of paracetamol is not restricted to the airways and may affect a number of organ systems.
Pending the results of such research, paracetamol remains the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in childhood, to be used in accordance with WHO guidelines, which recommend that it should be reserved for children with a high fever (38.5Co or above).
According to Newton’s third law of motion, “for every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction.”
In fact, China should hope that no such apology is forthcoming.
When US global dominance was unquestioned, as in the 1990’s, it made sense for Israel to secure its long-term future by maintaining a stranglehold over the US Congress.
So time is no longer on Israel’s side.
An old saying in politics in Moscow is that relations between the United States and Russia are always better when a Republican rules in the White House.
Not only is Russia building a civilian nuclear reactor in Iran, thereby helping to advance Iranian knowledge of the nuclear process; it is also reluctant to support efforts by the United Nations Security Council to press Iran not to develop nuclear weapons.
Consider the words of Vitaly Tretyakov, the editor of the weekly Moscow News , on the recent US elections.
So we should limit them, right? For health reasons, yes, we should indeed do that; but, paradoxically, limiting such emissions would cause global warming to increase.
Lowering the level of black particles in the atmosphere would benefit both human health and the climate.
However, this is probably not a viable alternative.
The clearest sign that the boom is ending is the IMF’s forecast of 1.5% growth for the US in 2008.
Thus, the world cannot help but be pulled down by a US slump.
The mortgage-backed securities that US banks succeeded in selling to the world are not comparable to European assets with similar names.
Indeed, adjusted for inflation, the dollar is now nearly as low against the euro as it was against the deutschmark in 1992, when German unification resulted in the breakdown of the European currency system.
True, the US Federal Reserve has tried to prevent a recession by cutting its interest rates. But the Fed cannot endow the banks with new equity capital and prevent a credit crunch.
“Big Blue” (as IBM is known) allowed other companies (notably the infant Microsoft) to develop its software.
But this initial triumph of the PC (and very substantial sales in the 1980’s) did not immediately fulfill all the initial hopes for individual empowerment and social transformation.
The potential was alluring, but also terrifying.
But the alleged obsolescence of the PC is actually a sign of how basic it has become to a new vision of society.
Netanyahu’s response to Obama’s initiative signaled what has been apparent for some time: the complex regional process known as the Arab Spring, and the eve of a US presidential election year, are difficult circumstances in which to try to re-start the peace process.
New Arab leaders will struggle mightily with the public’s rising expectations, and their willingness to get behind a peace process will take a backseat to that struggle.
But the absence of a peace process could encourage its return.
Indeed, Yeltsin was fearless, and sought not his personal survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced to Russia.
Putin, by contrast, seems incapable of recognizing and admitting his mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure is visible to the world.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s arrest and trial were orchestrated for precisely this reason.
This is one reason why Russia has become so aggressive with its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, and seeks to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the breakaway region of Moldova.
Other advanced economies or emerging markets (the rest of the euro zone; New Zealand, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, and some Southeast European economies) are also nearing a recessionary hard landing.
Japan used to grow modestly for two reasons: strong exports to the US and a weak yen.
Countries that allowed their currencies to appreciate relative to the dollar will experience a sharp slowdown in export growth.
The paradox of today’s quest for energy independence is that pursuing it actually increases energy insecurity. However much politicians who call for energy independence might prefer it otherwise, the market has chosen oil as a staple energy source.
After all, a collapse in oil prices would be a death sentence for several new energy technologies, and, not incidentally, would increase demand for oil.
Would politicians, with their perpetual fascination with “independence,” attempt to eliminate dependence one commodity at a time? Put another way, would the cause of “energy independence” seek to reverse globalization?
This theory went strongly against conventional wisdom.
But I kept at it, and, step by step, addressed different key issues – such as biocompatibility, manufacturing, reproducibility of release, and bioactivity.
As a proof of principle, we decided to synthesize a new family of biodegradable polymers, called polyanhydrides, for medical use.
We returned the proposal for another review; it came back with the comment that the polymers were fragile and would break.
Scientists throughout history have often had to fight conventional wisdom to validate their discoveries.
Often the choice depends less on a rational assessment of similarities and differences than on gut feelings, proclivities to optimism or pessimism, or political orientation.
There are modern parallels.
This nationalist-minded rhetoric has returned in the financial crisis of 2007.
In those panics, financial innovation caused uncertainty and nervousness, but also induced an important and beneficial learning process.
Indeed, failure to reach a settlement in the past was not the result of bad faith, or inadequate negotiating skills.
But, notwithstanding the damage that the Palestinian strategy is inflicting on Israel’s increasingly fragile international standing, Abbas might be embarking on what could turn out to be a self-defeating diplomatic exercise.
Any government that recognizes the Palestinian state would inevitably view that act as the end of the peace process, and neither Europe nor the US would include in the package any acknowledgement of the Palestinian right of return to areas lost to Israel in 1948.
A plan that almost certainly would have to satisfy Israel’s security concerns and lean toward acknowledging its Jewishness – in a way that might entirely neutralize the Palestinian ethos of return – would be especially unpalatable to them.
Those who said that there would be no downturn, or that recovery would be rapid, or that the economy’s real problems were structural, or that supporting the economy would produce inflation (or high short-term interest rates), or that immediate fiscal austerity would be expansionary were wrong. Not just a little wrong.
The first is the failure of central banks to adopt a rule like nominal GDP targeting or its equivalent.
But, in July 2011, the ten-year US Treasury bond rate crashed to 2%, and it was below 1.5% at the start of June.
At the center of the first narrative, preferred by financial-sector executives, is the view that all necessary reforms have already been adopted (or soon will be).
(I serve on the FDIC’s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee; all views stated here are my own.)
As Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, put it recently, using the delicate language of central bankers, “The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled.
And, when things go badly, it becomes the taxpayers’ problem (or the problem of some foreign government and their taxpayers).
But if many people start to doubt Italy’s solvency and require a large premium to lend, the country’s fiscal deficit will worsen, and it will most likely default.
As in many wars, a staged escalation in a financial crisis often leads to the worst possible outcome: a defeat with large losses.
In the meantime, Italy is sinking.
To act, politicians need consensus, which often does not emerge until the costs of inaction have become highly visible.
Trapped between the possible and the necessary, Israelis and Palestinians simply learned to live without a solution.
The two-state solution is rapidly losing its appeal.
Jordanians of the caliber of Former Prime Ministers Abdelsalam Al-Majali and Taher al-Masri, as well as a former adviser of King Hussein, Adnan Abu-Odeh, have been advancing schemes for a Jordanian-Palestinian solution.
On December 10, Edmund Phelps, my colleague at Columbia University, received the Nobel Prize in economics for 2006. The award was long overdue.
As a practical matter, even controlling for expectations (as Phelps’ work insists that we do), the relationship between unemployment and inflation is highly unstable.
Nor is there evidence that inflation, should it increase slightly, cannot be reversed at a relatively minor cost – comparable to the benefits of additional employment and growth enjoyed in the excessive expansion of the economy that led to the increase in inflation.
But it is a misuse of that analysis to conclude that nothing can be done about unemployment, or that monetary authorities should focus exclusively on inflation.
The Philippines’ Sanctuaries of Terror
Veterans of the Mindanao camps took part in almost every JI-linked bombing since 2000, including the attack that killed hundreds in Bali in 2002.
It enjoys popular support, expresses legitimate grievances, and peace talks are underway.
So what is to be done? American forces are probing the sanctuaries in the guise of training exercises, and they are backing targeted air strikes.
The Filipino armed forces must be better equipped to close down any remaining terrorist sanctuaries – and keep them closed.
Many books have recently documented the games played by the climate-change deniers.   Merchants of Doubt , a new book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway set for release in mid-2010, will be an authoritative account of their misbehavior.
The first was the hacking of a climate-change research center in England.
In other words, their arguments were systematic and contrived, not at all original to the circumstances.
It is our responsibility to listen, to understand the message, and then to act.
These pirates currently hold more than a dozen ships hostage in Somali ports.
The Canadian naval mission ends in late October, and no country has stepped forward to replace it.
There is a clear way to begin.
Moreover, illegal fishing operations are known to subject people aboard pirate ships to unsafe and unfair working conditions at sea.
Because fish and other ocean wildlife do not stay within national boundaries, international cooperation is essential to the long-term health of the world’s oceans and the sustainability of fisheries and fishing jobs.
As allies, the US and Europe are taking a major step forward to end the scourge of pirate fishing.
Instead, European law requires an individual determination that deportation is necessary and proportionate to the crime committed, as well as consideration of other circumstances (such as the strength of the individual’s ties to the community).
Primary responsibility for safeguarding the rights and well-being of all citizens lies with EU member states.
The divide is physical, not just mental.
Europe’s Political Stress Tests
Moreover, its poll numbers continue to climb.
Similarly, Portugal’s center-right Social Democratic Party has pushed a tough pro-austerity line, including tax hikes and spending cuts, since coming to power in 2011.
Alternatively, citizens could try to lead efforts to re-negotiate their countries’ constitutional arrangements.
The euro has strengthened by nearly 10% against the dollar since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed on July 26 to do “whatever it takes” to hold the currency together.
With the ESM and ECB capping interest rates on government bonds, countries will have as much time as they need – and they will need plenty – to reduce their debt burdens to manageable levels.
In their October 18 communiqué, eurozone leaders stated in no uncertain terms that they are not prepared to go there.
Even in Greece, where conditions are the worst, Golden Dawn is still a minority party.
This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries.
Political interference in the stock market is not merely about taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income.
Of course, this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not supporting the stock market.
But one should be clear about what one is forecasting. Essentially, one is forecasting not just economics, but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance.
By asking whichever senior officials she saw to pass on her gift and her best wishes to Zhao, the Chinese leadership would understand that the outside world was still thinking of him and wanted to ensure his survival.
No one in government would be in any doubt about what she wanted to do.
It could have gone terribly wrong, bringing down her and her administration.
She regarded ideas as the very core of politics, and she battled for those that she held.
Extreme poverty breeds apathy, not rebellion.
People reacted in a variety of ways.
But they soon discovered that realizing this prospect would require a longer and more arduous journey than they had anticipated.
Seductive leaders (Hitler among them) exploited the resulting sense of frustration.
Such inequalities exist, to varying degrees, in all developed countries.
This view naturally underpins interventions like targeted smoking-cessation services or health-education initiatives.
After all, some potential solutions are politically easier to implement within existing systems than others.
The Politics of Revolutionary Surprise
Longtime regime opponents, too, were caught off guard.
As it turned out, by the time the seriousness of the rebellion became clear, fear was already changing sides even within the halls of Tunisian power.
In Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen, no one knows where power will lie in the months to come.
The Arab street has changed the calculus of fear not only in the countries that have witnessed major protests, but also in the rest of the Arab world, where rulers are on notice that discontent need not remain submerged forever.
All this resolve was shattered by revelations about Toledo's personal advisor, César Almeyda, whom he appointed to head the new National Intelligence Board.
Despite this, he brims with imagined presidential plans, such as ridding the country of terrorist groups like Shining Path and re-establishing Peru's economic standing.
But he stubbornly refused, and his belated admission came too late to gain public favor.
The Politics of Values
More than that, the divisions are reproduced at the local level.
When he speaks of “modernization,” or of “bringing things into the twenty-first century,” he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability.
A pacifist streak of values is also unmistakable in Europe.
The Post-Nuclear Transition
German energy policy now depends once more on the future deployment of renewable energy sources.
Over the past decade, 370,000 new jobs have been created in the sector, and exports of renewable-energy technology are rising rapidly, totaling roughly €30 billion from 2006 to 2008.
In Europe, the number of nuclear plants is declining, as old plants are decommissioned and public opinion in even traditionally pro-nuclear countries like France begins to shift: almost two-thirds of the French now believe that nuclear power stands in the way of an increase in renewable energy.
Given the precision required to operate on an organ as delicate as the brain, the convergence of mechanical technologies with the art of surgery catalyzed progress in the field.
Because the human brain makes decisions based on sensory input – and, of course, experience – such data are essential for the surgeon to make the most informed choices possible during surgery.
Surgeons operating manually know how much force they exert only by the way it feels; a surgical simulator, by contrast, could measure that force and indicate when a trainee is applying excessive or insufficient pressure.
Worse yet, it misleads us into counterproductive economic policies.
Because financial institutions held much of these securities, their market values declined as well, leaving balance sheets in need of restructuring, particularly given their highly leveraged capital structures.
If the government could identify how the economy needed to be restructured and provide incentives to move resources more quickly in that direction, a properly designed program could alleviate and shorten the recession.
First, the value of financial institutions’ investments should immediately be marked down to their market values.
Beyond that, the realignment process is best left largely to private agents.
In 2000, the world’s leaders committed to achieve major reductions in poverty, hunger, and disease by 2015.
By using high-yield seeds, better soil management, and proper row planting, the community has more than tripled its crop production, and villagers who previously were hungry grain buyers are now food-secure grain sellers.
NEW YORK – Elites are under siege in every corner of the world.
In Thailand, the rage stems from the perceived neglect of the rural poor by the ruling class, backed by big business, the army, and the king.
The heroine of the US Tea Party movement, Sarah Palin, is as much a creature of twittering and the vast new blogosphere as she is of television and radio – perhaps more so.
There is, however, another way to look at the worldwide surge of populism.
Reliance on a self-promoting tycoon like Thaksin is not the best way to boost democracy, but nor is reliance on military coups and kingly intervention.

Simply put, Keynes believed that we cannot all cut our way to growth at the same time.
Indeed, just a year or two ago, “expansionary fiscal contraction” was all the rage, and a massive research effort went into proving its existence.
An International Monetary Fund paper in 2012 brought Alesina’s hour of glory to an end.
Second, austerity policies have hit those at the bottom of the income distribution far more severely than those at the top, simply because those at the top rely much less on government services.
But supporting Ahmadinejad turned out to be a costly decision for Khamenei – and for the Islamic Republic.
In 2009, after Khamenei rejected Ahmadinejad’s decision to appoint Mashai as his first deputy, Ahmadinejad brazenly appointed him Chief of Staff, a move that infuriated Khamenei.
In many ways, Ahmadinejad’s story resembles that of Banisadr.
Indeed, the lack of a strong, unified government capable of shaping a consensus could make it impossible even for Khamenei to change course, leaving Iran no choice but to persist in its diplomatic standoff with the West.
So it is no surprise that press freedom is the freedom that authoritarian governments are keenest to curtail.
Max Mosley admitted participating in this (not illegal) happening, but sued the News of the World for breach of privacy; the newspaper argued that it was in the “public interest” that Mosley’s sexual activities be disclosed.
By contrast, in Britain it is left to judges to decide what the “right to privacy” means.
The media might become a bit drearier, but public life would be far healthier.
Even if Bush could be forgiven for taking America, and much of the rest of the world, to war on false pretenses, and for misrepresenting the cost of the venture, there is no excuse for how he chose to finance it.
It will take years to overcome the excessive indebtedness and real-estate overhang that resulted.
But mistakes in the early years of those wars complicated that already-difficult battle.
The legacy will be with us for a long time. It pays to think before acting.
Goldman whiz-kid Fabrice Tourre is charged with having created a complicated security that was designed to fail.
“Double-entry bookkeeping” is one of the great discoveries of European civilization, but five centuries later most people are still muddled about assets and liabilities.
Political correctness is another aspect of this: calling disabled people “differently abled,” for example.
For emerging market countries, where the surge in capital inflows has led to fears of inflation and asset price bubbles, a pragmatic approach using a combination of macroeconomic and prudential financial policies is available.”
The price of clarity, like the price of liberty, is eternal vigilance, and the two are connected.
Thanks to reports just released by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee – one on the long-term implications of requiring higher capital-to-asset ratios, and one on the transitory effects of introducing them – we know more now about the likely impact of such regulation.
The second report finds that a one-percentage-point increase in bank capital ratios, if introduced gradually over four years, would lower GDP by about 0.2%.
None of this means that banks should be granted a regulatory holiday and forget the need to recapitalize.
But that doesn’t mean that reform should not be as cost-effective as possible.
“Men cannot be employed when the object of desire [i.e., money] is something which cannot be produced and the demand for which cannot readily be choked off.”
Economists disagree about when, under what circumstances, and in what order governments should move beyond these first two items on the checklist.
Germany and the US began theirs in 1933.
But, while we can all think of examples of Americans who rose to the top on their own, what really matters are the statistics: to what extent do an individual’s life chances depend on the income and education of his or her parents?
Those at the top, in such cases, are enriched at the direct expense of those at the bottom.
Market forces, of course, play a role, too, but markets are shaped by politics; and, in America, with its quasi-corrupt system of campaign finance and its revolving doors between government and industry, politics is shaped by money.
This leads to underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and technology, impeding the engines of growth.
He was shot 13 times in the back of his head and dumped in a cemetery, joining a macabre roll call of Latin American reporters brutalized for daring to speak out during the 1970’s and 1980’s.
Even more widespread than indirect repression is the corrupting pressure of government money.
All but the most courageous remain silent; with the threat of ruin for their paper or station, the risks that reporters run are no longer primarily their own.
Felling seven million hectares of trees each year, South America clears more forests than any other continent.
While the economic benefits we get from biodiversity might seem intangible, they are real and quantifiable.
But, while this implies that the benefits of conservation outstrip the costs by an extraordinary margin, the calculations have been widely criticized.
For a landowner, the value of cleared land works out to $300 per hectare on average.
Capitalists for Inclusive Growth
There are three main areas to which business should turn its attention if capitalism is to function in a more inclusive way and meet society’s most pressing needs.
For example, Unilever has rejected the short-term pressures of capital markets by ending quarterly earnings reporting and broadening its focus to advance greater social interests, rather than just the interests of its shareholders.
COPENHAGEN – This decade has seen remarkable progress against humanity’s greatest challenges.
Bill Gates’s Giving Pledge challenge has graduated from concept to campaign, with at least $125 billion promised to good causes.
The Copenhagen Consensus project, which I direct, provides a link between academic research and concrete economic analysis that can be used by decision-makers in the real world.
Debate and discussion is encouraged by ensuring that three papers are written for each topic, so that a range of expert opinions is available.
Pressure on China today to push up the value of the yuan against the dollar is eerily similar to the pressure on Japan 30 years ago to make the yen appreciate.
Sustained appreciation of a creditor country’s currency against the world’s dominant money is a recipe for a slowdown in economic growth, followed by eventual deflation, as Japan found in the 1990’s – with no obvious decline in its large relative trade surplus.
But interest rates on dollar assets are given in world markets independently of what China does.
Failing this, China must postpone full liberalization of its financial markets.
Communism fell. Germany was united.
Yet China will undoubtedly become the world’s largest economic power in the foreseeable future. To achieve this leadership position, it needs less than a quarter of US per capita GDP, because its population is more than four times larger.
The brain drain is a problem not only for South America west of the Andes and many African countries, but also for Turkey, Italy, Britain, the Balkan countries, Germany, and Finland.
It can only be hoped that the political leaders who shape the course of the twenty-first century will be wise enough to avoid such an outcome.
Regional cooperation should include areas ranging from trade, transport, and transit, to water and energy, as well as efforts to control of drug trafficking.
While illicit drugs are moved through all Central Asian countries, Tajikistan bears the brunt of the scourge due to its location at the northern border of Afghanistan.
The Hydrogen Solution
Their study lends scientific supportto several such projects underway in Europe aimed at proving that hydrogen gas, converted from water via electrolysis – think of it as natural gas minus the polluting carbon – and stored, for example, in subterranean salt caverns, can smooth out fluctuations inherent in solar and wind energy.
According to the author and environmentalist Bill McKibben, Germany is in the international forefront of fighting climate change: “The clear alternative and the best news from 2012 came from Germany, the one big country that’s taken climate change seriously....There were days last summer when [Germans] generated more than half the power that they used from solar panels.”
Regardless of whether the referendum succeeds or fails, and regardless of the details of the constitutional text, what is most important is the establishment of constitutional processes and institutions in Iraq, before and after the referendum.
Those who chose not to participate in last January’s elections will most certainly do so now, both in the referendum and in the upcoming elections to a new Assembly in December.
However, given the little weight given to constitutions in Iraq’s modern history, it is likely that the political class will leave the text alone.
Constitutions frequently enshrine lofty principals, and nobly assure protection of fundamental rights.
The paradox is that, in the Soviet era, his art was used, briefly, as a force for liberation, because Nikita Khrushchev allowed the publication of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in order to buttress his anti-Stalin thaw.
It is a sad testament to Russia’s current mindset that it is Solzhenitsyn the anti-modernist crank who is being remembered, not Solzhenitsyn the towering foe of Soviet barbarism and mendacity.
Solzhenitsyn was banned, driven first underground and then into exile.
Yet perhaps one day we Russians will escape our false dreams, and when that day comes, the heroic Solzhenitsyn, the Solzhenitsyn who could never surrender or be corrupted, will be restored to us.
On the other were conservatives, “a class of men who cling with fondness to whatever is ancient, and who, even when convinced by overpowering reasons that innovation would be beneficial, consent to it with many misgivings and forebodings.”
Beck, who denies that he is anti-Semitic, is a conspiracy theorist of classic vintage, though the content of his alleged conspiracies is, to put it bluntly, weird.

One would think that a self-proclaimed conservative like Beck would support that sort of activity.
Along with a relatively minor spreadsheet error, they identified some methodological choices in the original Reinhart/Rogoff work that threw the robustness of their results into question.
No matter how far apart their political views may have been, the two sides shared a common language about what constitutes evidence and – for the most part – a common approach to resolving differences.
Consider what happens in international trade, where such shading of research is established practice.
Second, empirical evidence is rarely reliable enough to settle decisively a controversy characterized by deeply divided opinion.
If these skills also render them perceptive observers of real societies and provide them with sound judgment, it is hardly by design.
The ruling United Russia party’s recent poor performance in regional elections show that the electorate is fed up with the status quo and is ready to vote for an alternative.
But a government official must pursue the public interest, which includes preserving a competitive environment in the oil or banking sector.
First, it is not clear who will replace the bureaucrats as board chairs.
Whether these improvements in corporate governance are actually implemented will be clear to all.
But when in several years one of his former regional First Secretaries, Boris Yeltsin that is, signed a decree banning the Communist Party none of 18 million party members went to the streets to protest.
Putin’s supposedly heroic victory came in the war with Georgia of 2008, followed by the subsequent virtual annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
So now we hear pathetic echoes of all the reform communist efforts of the long years of Soviet decline: Putinism without Putin, Putinism with a human face, etc.
The PRI promised to reestablish order and predictability, and to reduce the violence inflicted by the drug cartels, even if that means reaching a modus vivendi with them.
But any reasonable analysis of the current PRI does not support that prediction, and reveals it to be based on little more than wishful thinking.
The Quality of Mercy
Megrahi was convicted of murdering 270 people, and sentenced to life imprisonment.
For a pickpocket who has served half of a two-year sentence, it would be excessively harsh to insist on the sentence being served in full if that meant that he would die in prison, rather than with his family.
And, if we believe that Megrahi was not sufficiently punished for his crime, what are we to make of the treatment of former Lieutenant William Calley?
One wonders if the relatives of those murdered at My Lai are more ready to forgive Calley than the relatives of those killed at Lockerbie are to forgive Megrahi.
As with the Quantified Self, the tools for collecting and analyzing data about everything from public health to potholes in roads, real-estate prices, school attendance, and more are beginning to emerge.
The goal is to create competition – among communities and among developers of the tools – and thus to foster even better tools and more livable, productive communities.
In addition to selling advertising around the data, local newspapers could charge institutions for specific data analyses, benchmarking studies, and the like.
The Hong Kong meeting of the Doha Round of trade negotiations has left a palpable sense of frustration in the developing world over the slow pace of agricultural liberalization agreed to by the rich countries.
Indeed, without returning to the illusion of economic planning, these countries need to be able to set conditions for foreign investors that aim to maximize the local impact on employment, technological diffusion, strategic partnerships, and so forth.
Such a prospect would be even less acceptable to developing countries.
Some economists point to imperfect information, which precludes companies from considering the higher returns on investment available in the developing world.
On September 19, the French researcher Gilles-Eric Séralini attempted to fuel public opposition to genetically modified foods by showing the public how GM corn, with and without the pesticide Roundup, caused huge tumors and early death in 200 rats that had consumed it over two years.
Of these, five died within two years, which is unusual, because studies of thousands of untreated Sprague-Dawley rats show that about half should have died in that period.
That, in turn, implies less human encroachment into natural ecosystems, enabling greater biodiversity.
The technologies that can really make a difference quickly and at lower cost are scrubbers that clean smokestack emissions, catalytic converters that reduce tailpipe emissions, and many others.
One is Europe's aging population.
Even more fundamentally, racial considerations also influence the nature of America's political institutions.
It is lacking in the racially mixed Southeast and Southwest.
The second is to somehow restrict welfare benefits to "natives."
And yet, over the last few years Burma has also emerged as a significant producer of energy in Southeast Asia.
The device is simple.
Recorded at the market exchange rate, however, these earnings translate into 1.2 trillion kyat – an amount large enough to eliminate Burma’s budget deficit, as well as the destructively inflationary money printing that is the regime’s preferred method of public finance.
The report noted that nobody had been prosecuted.
In February 2006, we visited a refugee camp on the Thai-Burma border and learned first hand of war and abuse.
But the junta engages in Orwellian doublethink.
Such abuse of power is inadmissible, and we expect ASEAN to address the military’s use of rape in the conflict in Burma.
In other words, a central bank’s primary responsibility is not to preserve the health of the firms that make up the banking sector, but rather to maintain the robust functioning of the economy as a whole.
But, while such an announcement is an obvious no-brainer for those in the Macroeconomic Camp, it would make all bankers who hold nominal assets or who think in nominal terms physically ill.
The world, fixated on China’s rise, was slow to pay attention to this seismic shift in the politics of the globe’s second largest economy.
Look what happens when Asians are foolish enough to import such a system, as in South Korea or Taiwan.
This involved some strong-arm tactics, especially against the unions, but it worked mostly because the middle class settled for an informal deal: increased material prosperity in exchange for political acquiescence.
The DPJ’s aims are excellent: more authority to elected politicians, less bureaucratic meddling, more independence from the US, better relations with Asian neighbors, more power to voters and less to big business, and so on.
The Re-Education of Hong Kong
What triggered the uproar was the appearance of a “model” textbook, financed by the government and published by a pro-China think tank.
The students have promised to continue to fight the program until it is scrapped.
And most, if not all, of the children of the ruling elite in Beijing are in a similar position.
He claimed that he had only Hong Kong’s interest in mind within the limits of China’s “one country, two systems” formula.
In medieval Spain, Quixote-like knights probably did roam the countryside, ridding it not of dragons but of the land’s few remaining Muslims.
Che was no humanist.
As could be expected, Che applied Soviet policies to the Cubans: agriculture was destroyed and ghost factories dotted the landscape.
Beyond Cuba, the Che myth has inspired thousands of students and activists across Latin America to lose their lives in foolhardy guerrilla struggles.
The Real Danger of Global Warming
With the global financial crisis and the sudden economic downturn, two things are becoming clear.
So I am amazed to see people going along with the currently fashionable political argument that policies like cap-and-trade, government mandates, and subsidies for renewable energy can actually benefit an economy.
The Real Long March
It remains a daunting journey, through areas little changed to this day, inaccessible, and desperately poor.
Mao told Edgar Snow, author of Red Star Over China, that crossing the Dadu River was the single most important incident during the Long March, and today it is eulogized as such.
There were constant debates about the final destination.
Not, however, for the 21,000 men and women of the Western Legion.
The Long Marchers persevered, fought, starved, despaired, and endured.
CANBERRA – The brouhaha over Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff’s article “Growth in a Time of Debt” may be the most conspicuous and incendiary scholarly controversy since 1974, when two earlier economists, Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, published a notorious book, Time on the Cross, defending the efficiency of American plantation slavery.
Yet the Bureau does not require scholars to post their data and programs to its Web site as a condition for working-paper publication.
In the case of Reinhart and Rogoff, the observation that highly indebted countries grow more slowly, even if true, does not tell us anything about whether high debt causes slow growth or vice versa.
The real problem is scholarly procedures and priorities, not motives.
In his Instauratio Magna, Francis Bacon, one of modern science’s most articulate proponents, conveyed a vision of a new world, transformed through the systematic inquiry of natural phenomena.
As the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition: “The genomic revolution is here – are you ready?”
But realizing this vision requires accounting for the different choices that people make within a pluralistic society.
The transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern, but power diffusion is a more novel process.
In an information age, however, it may be the state (or non-state) with the best story that wins.
As the cost of computing and communication comes down, the barriers to entry decline.
In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak’s rule helped to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and balanced Iranian power in the region.
Putin then decided to disavow his own marriage to Lyudmila Shkrebneva, his wife of 29 years, announcing the divorce in as publicly humiliating a way as possible – his wife was standing by his side – for a reserved Russian woman.
He said it was over, with his stone-faced wife on hand to confirm with a silence that spoke louder than words.
If former French President Nicolas Sarkozy could divorce and remarry a world-famous model and singer while in office, a Russian president can, too.
By contrast, the suicide in 1939 of Stalin’s wife, Nadezhda Allilueva, underscored the reign of terror in the country.
In many countries, fears have even arisen of a prolonged period of slow and occasionally negative growth, persistent obstacles to reducing unemployment, and continued economic anxiety; or worse, of a Japanese-style “lost decade” with multiple recessions; or, even worse, of a depression, (which politicians and intellectuals have stoked in an attempt to justify continued massive government intervention in the economy for years to come).
Thereafter, growth is labeled an “expansion.”
But the economy did indeed grow in the interim – just barely enough to consider them distinct recessions.
If the economy declines again – a highly plausible prospect – we would have a triple dip, although perhaps not an outright second recession.
Contrary to the election in 2000, when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College, Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes.
For much of its early history – to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction – the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition.
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term.
But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public.
When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an abortive attempt by the Greek military junta in Athens to carry out Enosis (unification with Greece), 250,000 or so Greek Cypriots were uprooted from their homes.
Within a few years, the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern, Greek Cypriot sector of the island.
The Greek Cypriots chose the path of non-violence; the Palestinians chose the opposite route.
The new report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), involving more than 120 scientists, economists, and technology specialists, provides that long-overdue assessment.
Renewables cut air pollution, which is costing the global economy billions of dollars a year in health-care costs alone.
International policies, including the lending decisions of the World Bank and regional development banks, must evolve, as do the strategies of the UN and bilateral donors.
The IPCC report has provided a solid, scientific foundation for a low-carbon, resource-efficient future.
RMB appreciation should have started earlier and at a faster pace, when China’s trade surplus was much smaller and its growth was much less dependent on exports.
The dilemma that officials face is that the impact of a fall in exports as a result of RMB appreciation will be felt acutely and immediately, whereas the large welfare losses due to the evaporation of the value of China’s foreign-exchange reserves will be borne by society as a whole – but not immediately.
But if the RMB is allowed to float, isn’t a balanced trade account likely? Probably not.
But that dual objective requires structural change in the Chinese and US economies.
To some people, the question is a moral one.
The lord has made no improvements to the river and is helping nobody in any way, directly or indirectly, except himself.
Why shouldn’t banks be allowed to engage in any business they want, at least as long as we have regulators to ensure that the banks’ activities do not jeopardize the entire financial infrastructure?
The new consensus can be described as follows: Ségolène Royal cannot defeat Nicolas Sarkozy, but Sarkozy can defeat himself.
Her defeat would be theirs, too, but their resentment over losing the nomination to her is so far proving stronger than their political survival instincts.
It is as if France were now seized by a kind of nostalgic generosity toward a presidency that had been marked by suspicion and derision.
The Resistible Rise of Asia?
To take the most significant example, China staged military interventions even when it was poor and internally troubled.
And, by picking territorial fights with its neighbors and pursuing a muscular foreign policy, China’s leaders are compelling other Asian states to work more closely with the US and each other.
So make no mistake. Asia’s challenges are graver than those facing Europe, which embodies comprehensive development more than any other part of the world.
Both are rich in diamonds.
(As the old adage has it, banks only like to lend to those who do not need money.)
Democratic, consensual, and transparent processes - such as those in Botswana - are more likely to ensure that the fruits of a country's wealth are equitably and well spent.
Western governments can help with common-sense reforms.
No state can abdicate the responsibility to protect its own people from crimes against humanity, let alone justify perpetrating such crimes itself.
Is it time to apply and enforce a no-fly zone? Or to go further still and send in ground forces with a mandate to do what it takes?
The hope was that states’ failure to protect their inhabitants would no longer be seen as nobody else’s business, as had been the case for centuries, but as the entire world’s concern.
If these measures do not bite immediately, and the carnage continues, there will be no alternative but to do more.
Brazil has attempted to address the issue by crafting a resolution that would decouple the R2P mandate from the use of force – effectively eliminating the possibility that the doctrine could be applied.
Even cooperation on climate change is crumbling, with the US and China rejecting the multilateral, top-down approach to policymaking.
Governments before World War I – and even more so before WWII – did not embrace the mission of minimizing unemployment during economic downturns.
All three of these factors vanished between the world wars.
How can the US have a large political movement – the Tea Party – pushing for the hardest of hard-money policies when there is no hard-money lobby with its wealth on the line? How is it that the unemployed, and those who fear they might be the next wave of unemployed, do not register to vote?
The Fed cannot reduce short-term interest rates below zero, so it is attempting via this policy of “quantitative easing” to reduce longer-term interest rates.
“But we Japanese,” he writes, “don’t have a religion such as Christianity or Islam, so we need something else: deep emotion.”
Some thinkers, most notably Max Weber, floated the idea that capitalism must be sustained by a value system that could not initially be created from within.
But a deeper view of freedom regards it as having intrinsic value.
Oddly, it was Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who, by requesting that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, reopened the 1948 file.
As a result, the Palestinian community in the occupied territories was always subservient to the primacy of the Palestinian Diaspora.
The Palestinians are attempting to hold the stick at both ends, claiming before the world their endorsement of the two-state solution while calling for the right of return at the same time.
The Return of American Realism
Much of this debate can be viewed through the lens of American involvement with Iraq.
This shift is also evident in US policy toward China.
Israel, for example, has had peaceful relations with non-democratic Egypt and Jordan for more than three decades.
Britain has largely excluded itself from any leadership role in Europe.
Of course, it is impossible to underestimate the combination of suspicion, tension, and exasperation that characterizes Franco-German relations lately.
France and Germany have different sensitivities on the subject, which is both natural and inevitable, as these differences reflect both geography and history.
An economy’s current account is the difference between its investment rate and its savings rate.
China has the opposite problem.
The resulting flood of liquidity caused a global boom that benefited economies from Elizabethan England to Mughal India.
So, the real question is what the next generation of symbiotic imbalances will look like.
Industrial policy is back.
And the highly successful salmon industry is the creation of Fundación Chile, a quasi-public venture fund.
The shift toward embracing industrial policy is therefore a welcome acknowledgement of what sensible analysts of economic growth have always known: developing new industries often requires a nudge from government.
Given its risks and the gap between its social and private benefits, innovation requires rents – returns above what competitive markets provide.
What determines success in industrial policy is not the ability to pick winners, but the capacity to let the losers go – a much less demanding requirement.
Moreover, in the absence of an impartial judge, a winner can always impose his “truth” upon the vanquished, as happened with the Treaty of Versailles after World War I.
In the meantime, the return to the idea of a “just cause” carries big risks, especially evident when, as happened in Georgia, a great power claims the mantle of a protector of the rights of its nationals in a neighboring country.
The medieval Popes practiced this wisdom when they limited permissible wars to certain times of year.
Fighting terrorism is not a war, because terrorism itself is not a warring party, but a means to an end.
And, in their heyday, mercantilists certainly did defend some very odd notions, chief among which was the view that national policy ought to be guided by the accumulation of precious metals – gold and silver.
But when it works, as it has so often in Asia, the model’s “government-business collaboration” or “pro-business state” quickly garners heavy praise.
Mercantilists, however, view trade as a means of supporting domestic production and employment, and prefer to spur exports rather than imports.
Liberals should be happy to have their consumption subsidized by mercantilists.
The Return of Mexico’s Nemesis
The country’s civil society has become more organized, more powerful, and more vibrant.
In this era, the government can’t get away with stealing elections, throwing political opponents in jail, expropriating foreign or domestic private assets, large-scale corruption, or profligate spending.
But I believe that we did accomplish the task, and that to fear an authoritarian restoration would be to deny everything that we have all achieved over the past 12 years.
Bulgaria’s entry into the European Union was heralded by a presidential race between an ex-communist (the victor, who claimed to like the EU) and a proto-fascist (who says he hates Turks, Gypsies, and Jews).
They do not believe that constitutional norms and representative democracy have primacy over values and “legitimate” popular grievances.
Moreover, these populists attack the EU as an elite-imposed project, while pro-European coalitions have become exhausted, disintegrating in the aftermath of EU accession in 2004.
And, while nationalist populism is a trans-European phenomenon, populism today, unlike in the 1930’s, it does not hold itself out as an alternative to democracy.
This new appeal to religion – after a long period when it was taken for granted that secularization would make religion less and less politically relevant – is not an exclusively French phenomenon.
Globally, there might be good reasons to talk about what sociologists describe as the rise of “post-secular societies,” but Europe remains the exception.
That is not an absurd idea.
Successful coups legitimated by popular support (or at least acquiescence) and oiled with promises to “restore democracy” may become infectious, encouraging copycats in neighboring states where governments are also weak or failing.
In Guinea, despite 24 previous years of authoritarian military rule, the population largely supported the December 2008 bloodless coup staged by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara’s immediately following President Lansana Conté’s death.
But these steps are largely ineffective – or worse.
Nevertheless, coups, whether violent or peaceful, are the antithesis of democratic institutions, and military rule can last a long time.
Nepal’s 15-year experiment with democracy now seems over.
Newspapers and magazines are blandly reproducing official pronouncements and reports from the state-run news agency.
Old jokes from the pre-1990 days have returned, like this one: a man was walking down a Kathmandu street, shouting, “Down with dictatorship in Pakistan.” A policeman grabbed him and took him in.
Perhaps King Gyanendra does have something up his sleeves.
The Mexican Revolution of 1910 began with a challenge to the dictator Porfirio Díaz that ignited peasant uprisings and worker revolts.
But that disastrous campaign weakened Mao’s influence; by the early 1960’s he seemed to be relegated to the sidelines while pragmatists like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping grew stronger.
How should the US and European leaders respond?
Instead, they would seek to enter the world trade body as a single customs union.
Finally, the EU insists that Russia abolish planned prohibitive export tariffs on lumber. Only the Georgian issue is really serious.
Before Putin resigned as president in May 2008, he presented his “Russia 2020” program.
The prominent Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer insists that their prime aim is to finish off Georgia and its president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who remains in power and defiant.
Putin or his collaborators seem to be setting up Medvedev for a failure, suggesting that their jealousy of Medvedev’s limited power is greater than their interest in defending Russia’s national interests.
Then, there are the reactions to the new government, which have been marked by a temperateness of tone that is highly unusual – and all the more surprising, given that David Cameron, the new prime minister, has not exactly been the bearer of good news.
In a sense, the Conservative-Liberal coalition represents a culmination of this trend.
Clearly, however, nationalization, or a state-managed economy, is not in the cards.
There is a challenge to meet, a reason to pull together.
However, over time, other factors behind the growing number of cases, such as immigration and a particular type of drug-resistant TB, have emerged.

For example, one of the studies that we reviewed found that no standard therapy in the initial or secondary phase of treatment was associated with an unsuccessful outcome or death.
The DOTS strategy is not implemented in all European countries, owing in part to disagreement about whether treatment is a duty or a right.
For example, on Sina’s microblog site, bloggers used pictures, euphemisms, and English or traditional Chinese characters to avoid censorship.
Ever since Iranians used Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests against the stolen presidential election of June 2009, there has been much discussion about the role of digital activism in authoritarian countries like China.
Passionate people did not understand why the public seemed unconcerned about their efforts.
In fact, a series of protests and events held since the second half of 2009 suggests a close relationship between Twitter and contentious real-life politics, and thus invites new possibilities for reshaping China’s authoritarian regime.
When merit is measured by money, there is no ethical limit to the size of an individual’s paycheck.
So yesterday’s (pre-crisis) world is being resurrected.
I also participate indirectly and abstractly in forging the common good, by creating value through my work, and I am rewarded for it.
But don’t hold your breath waiting for them to agree.
The Guardian Council's barring of over 2,000 mostly reformist candidates from participating in the parliamentary elections was the last straw.
Many are reactionary religious fundamentalists who abhor the concept of democracy.
Although he is capable of providing people with increased political and social freedoms, he is simply unwilling.
As a result, Iran's near-term political prospects appear ominous.
Courageous Iranians who have labored to reform their country may continue to feel as though they are plowing the seas.
Indeed, the hybrid presidential/parliamentary system that Ukraine established as part of the settlement which brought a peaceful end to our revolution is being hollowed out in order to concentrate all political power in the hands of a supposedly democratically elected president.
Yet he was not.
One way to help prevent a democratic revolution from being betrayed from within is by building a genuine civil society.
As people around the world encourage the prospect of democracy coming to Egypt and Tunisia, let us not be beguiled by its formal trappings.
The conservative ARENA party, which has governed El Salvador since the country’s 10-year civil war ended in 1992, did everything possible to prevent an FMLN victory, resorted, once again, to every red-baiting trick in the book.
As recently as a year ago, anyone who visited FMLN headquarters in San Salvador to interview, for example, Ceren, its Secretary General, would be struck by the overwhelming presence of Chávez: red shirts, red berets, pictures of the Venezuelan caudillo, quotations from his teachings and musings.
We will know soon.
A general strike, affecting everything except electricity and the press, brings the country to a halt.
And it works.
Success is measured by one’s salary.
Nineteen sixty-eight is going global, fueled by doubt among university youth about the world that is being built.
A huge march shows the trade unions’ support for the student movement.
Some ministers resign, but there is no attack against institutions.
Everywhere outside Paris, calls for decentralization and regionalism grow.
The Cultural Revolution marked the climax of class extermination practiced by the Party during the 1960’s.
According to Wang Youqin, author of Victims of the Cultural Revolution , after Mao received the Red Guards and instructed them in the “militant fight,” more than 1,700 people were beaten, drowned, or scalded to death. Another 100,000 were driven from their homes.
The author Zheng Yi reported that in Wuxuan County alone, more than 100 people were eaten, because devouring enemies was the only way to prove one’s love for Mao.
Worst of all, Mao’s crimes against civilization, unlike those of, say, Hitler, are ongoing.
In June, the prestigious journal Science published an article by the South Korean scientist Woo-Suk Hwang and an international team of co-authors describing how they had developed what were, in effect, “made to order” lines of human stem cells cloned from an adult.
If Hwang was not the first to do it, someone else eventually will.
If, at a later date, the woman wants to have a child, why should she use the DNA of her earlier, aborted fetus rather than conceiving another fetus in the usual way? Each fetus – the one she aborts and the one she later conceives through sexual intercourse – has its own “unique” DNA.
From Bill Clinton to Robert Redford, countless pundits blamed Sandy on climate change.
(Sandy, which was downgraded from a hurricane before it hit New York, was rebranded in the media as a “superstorm.”)
Models show that the world’s most ambitious climate policy, the EU’s “20-20-20” plan, will have a net cost of roughly $250 billion a year for the rest of the century, or about $20 trillion in total. Yet it will reduce sea-level rise by just nine millimeters by 2100.
Anchoring the Arab Awakening
But what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented, project-based, and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world.
Achieving ambitious goals for inclusive growth and job creation quickly without an enabling state and without using the banking system will be extremely difficult.
On the other hand, they are unlikely to benefit from the subsequent robust growth that most European transition countries experienced.
Welby’s request to die was widely publicized in Italy, where it led to heated debate.
Even the Roman Catholic Church has long held that there is no obligation to use “extraordinary” or “disproportionate” means to prolong life – a view reiterated in the “Declaration on Euthanasia” issued by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by Pope John Paul II in 1980.
This distinction is dubious.
The Dutch know how voluntary euthanasia is practiced in their country, they know that legal euthanasia has improved, rather than harmed, their medical care, and they want the possibility of assistance in dying, if they should want and need it.
This October, 128 leading experts in the fields of human rights and equality from 44 countries launched a landmark attempt to build on the epochal 1948 UN declaration to establish universal human equality.
These participants argued that specific legal duties, such as the right to a minimum wage and the right to vocational training, are more effective than the vague extension of anti-discrimination law to cover poverty as such.
Today, it is crucial if we are to prevent an even greater chasm from dividing the world’s haves and have-nots.
In these circumstances, continuing to raise borrowing costs would be a mistake.
Nevertheless, China must be careful when implementing RMB appreciation.
In the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies, possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit.
The group’s initiative, led by Räsänen, is called eCars - Now!
But the company’s Web site continues to attract new prospects, with 1,000 people now registered as likely or certain to buy such a vehicle.
Overall, the economics make sense.
Any far-sighted government could help not by subsidizing these efforts, but by buying up the old gasoline engines.
The Rights of Apes – and Humans
The Great Ape Project seeks to change the way we think about great apes, and ultimately, about animals in general.
Another, Martin Balluch, has been given a 1,500-page police file to justify his arrest.
It means rule by those who have merit.
Certainly, French leaders are not immune to corruption.
What about those who do not make it to university? How do the other 50% fare in a meritocratic world?
To this must be added another feature that Young described: meritocracy means only that another ruling group closes the gates behind it once it has achieved its status.
The Rise and Fall of Putinism
Now, from the entire spectrum of civil and political rights enumerated in Russia’s Constitution, we Russians have only one right remaining: the right to leave and return to the country freely.
A struggle for the restitution of constitutional rights in Russia first became noticeable in 2009.
Russia’s federal government and regional authorities are clearly alarmed by this rapidly growing civic activism.
Indeed, China is increasingly emphasizing its naval and maritime interests: economic development, territorial management, energy and food security as well as trade.
On the Spratley and Paracel islands -- seized from Vietnam and the Philippines respectively -- China is building port facilities to moor large surface ships and runways large enough to handle long-range bombers.

This will provide China with necessary capabilities to invade, should China’s rulers wish, Japan’s most remote islands, including the disputed Senkaku Islands, as well as Taiwan.
But TB treatment has been shadowed by the specter of drug resistance since the dawn of the antibiotic era.  Fifteen years ago, an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in New York City induced near panic, before a massive infusion of funds into the public health infrastructure turned the tide in the United States, and public interest waned.
Effective treatment and cure of MDR-TB requires prolonged use (typically two years) of a combination of drugs, including second-line drugs that for the most part are less potent than first-line agents, more toxic, or both.
The Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance has collected information on prevalence, patterns, and trends of drug resistance since 1994, focusing on resistance to first-line drugs and contributing much to our understanding of MDR-TB.  But surveillance for XDR-TB has been more limited, as drug susceptibility testing for second-line drugs is not well-standardized and for some drugs is poorly reproducible, while few countries perform such testing within the context of their national TB programs.  
China’s economy is growing more rapidly, and its total size will probably overtake Japan’s in a decade or two, but any serious analysis of power in East Asia must include Japan as a major factor.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has taken a more nationalistic stance than most of his predecessors, and his Liberal Democratic Party is committed to revising Article 9 of the constitution, which limits Japan’s forces to self-defense.
This would be a way for Japan to escape its reputation for insularity, avoid the mistakes of its military history, improve its relations with Asian neighbors who still remember the 1930’s, and increase Japan’s “soft” or attractive power.
The Rise of Mid-Level Powers
For many years, Japan has been taking very cautious steps into this area, but substantial changes have occurred recently.
Once such a coalition gains a sure footing, the next step would be to participate actively in the negotiation of major security issues, such as international arms control, arms reduction, and non-proliferation, while encouraging the involvement of China and Russia.
By 2020, China’s e-tail market could be as large as today’s markets in the US, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France combined.
Mass consumption in China and other emerging economies is coming of age in the Internet era.
Such businesses are also leveraging their broad access and widely recognized brands to expand their role in the financial-services sector.
But its approach to e-tail is poised to be one of the forces shaping the emerging-market Internet revolution of the twenty-first century.
Since the late twentieth century, most employment growth has come in services, particularly personal services – a pattern that looks like a reversal of a previous historical trend.
Lawyers work out prenuptial contracts, and then the complexities of divorce negotiations.
None of these new services can easily be standardized, or dealt with at long distances (as can some types of clerical legal and financial work).
In that pre-modern world, private life was extraordinarily public, whereas the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dramatically expanded the realm of individual privacy and self-definition.
MOSCOW – I was recently posed the following question: “The most important way in which the Internet and online social media are changing our world is [fill in the blank].” My standard answer is that it changes the balance of power between individuals and institutions.
Those companies go online to earn money.
This phenomenon is not visible yet, because analysts focus on popular bloggers and online media sites competing with traditional media.
The attention economy is one in which people spend their personal time attracting others’ attention, whether by designing creative avatars, posting pithy comments, or accumulating “likes” for their cat photos.
China is clearly pleased to see that the United States is now also placing cool calculation of its national interests at the forefront of its foreign policy.
America’s new pragmatism is also the consequence of a process of “reverse socialization.”
America has the flexibility, capacity, and leadership to adapt to the new rules for pursuing diplomacy, but Europe simply does not.
And, if China comes out of the crisis as the big winner and continues to boost its power, zero-sum thinking will soon replace win-win cooperation.
But, at the same time, small states are also more likely to be successful in defending crucial aspects of the welfare state.
They have their own problems, but at the same time they are likely to behave more like traditional big states, and will try to shape globalization rather than simply accepting it as an inevitable process.
Many commentators, indeed, were stunned by the rapidity with which tensions returned to the international system.
All four North African rulers have, to greater or lesser degrees, made themselves the center of highly opaque power structures.
In Egypt, where such preparations are the most obvious, Gamal and other senior figures have stubbornly denied his presidential ambitions.
His departure would expose the anachronistic nature of the state’s ideological foundation; family ties will do nothing to protect his successor from the resulting shock to the system.
Ben Ali’s successor could raise his profile by clamping down on cronyism.
The new Penn World Table, Version 6.2, comparing standards of living across countries, has just been released.
Despite all the talk about the Chinese economic miracle, China’s ranking has risen only slightly, from 61st out of 82 countries in 2000 to 60th in 2004 – even though per capita real GDP grew by 44% between 2000 and 2004, or 9.6% a year, the highest of the major countries.
Economic performance in several Latin American countries was relatively weak in this period, with Uruguay’s real GDP per capita actually recording a fall by a fraction of a percent.
What have people been spending all that extra money on? Is it all dictated by advertisers and salesmen who are inventing needs?
The Risk of European Centralization
Politicians launched monetary union in 1999, despite warnings that the constituent economies were too diverse.
Indeed, it is Europe’s economic achievements that give it a political voice in the world.
This approach – harmonization, coordination, and centralized decision-making – continues to be regarded as a panacea for Europe’s problems.
Its current economic malaise reflects European leaders’ prolonged efforts to deny the obvious.
Ethnic violence marred the 1997 election as well.
But an updated constitution cannot instantly transform a country’s politics and society.
Many participants make simplistic, ethnocentric statements like, “Kikuyus should never rule Kenya again” (Kenyatta is a member of the dominant Kikuyu tribe).
Meanwhile, nothing has been done to appease the millions of poor Kenyans who are likely to heed a politician’s exhortation to kill.
Chinese shadow banking totals only about $2.2 trillion.
They should begin by reforming the property-rights regime to enable market forces to balance the supply and demand of savings and investments in a manner that maintains credit discipline and transparency.
Low-risk central-government bonds and central-bank reserve requirements – most of which are backed by substantial foreign-exchange reserves – account for ¥31 trillion of the ¥95 trillion in total commercial-bank assets.
Ultimately, addressing shadow banking in China will require mechanisms that clearly define, allocate, and adjudicate financial risks among the key players.
With lower and more realistic growth forecasts, fiscal deficits in the short to medium term are viewed as more dangerous.
Success is by no means assured, and the most likely outcome is a sequence of contagion events and a broader loss of confidence in the euro.
But that was not inevitable.
The alternative will be unilateral measures aimed at achieving the same goals, but leading to outcomes that leave everyone worse off.
SWFs pose concrete risks, some of which have already materialized, to the global economy and to financial markets both at home and in host countries.
But, while they are an important first step toward managing SWFs’ legal framework, institutional and governance structure, and investment and risk-management policies, they are unevenly applied, and are widely considered inadequate.
While the regulations are likely to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial crises, they will also make long-term loans more expensive and investments in illiquid assets riskier.
This initiative should be supported unequivocally, serving as a springboard for a stronger focus on green investment among SWFs.
Indeed, those who can borrow (high-grade firms and prime households) don’t want or need to, while those who need to – highly leveraged firms and non-prime households – can’t, owing to the credit crunch.
Yet imposing capital controls on inflows is difficult and sometimes leaky.
Also, if exit occurs by selling the long-term assets purchased during QE, a sharp increase in interest rates might choke off recovery, resulting in large financial losses for holders of long-term bonds.
And policymakers have moved to a risky credit-easing policy as QE’s effectiveness has waned.
But the road ahead is bumpy and uncertain.
Trade within Asia now accounts for more than half of the continent’s total trade turnover.

With economic shocks able to spread more quickly than ever before, owing to broadened trade and financial channels, all Asian countries must maintain a sound macroeconomic environment.
The authorities also introduced the “qualified domestic institutional investors” (QDII) program to enable residents to invest in foreign assets – one of many initiatives aimed at easing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate by encouraging capital outflows.
As Barry Eichengreen has pointed out in the context of the post-WWII Bretton Woods system, capital controls weaken “the link between domestic and foreign economic policies, providing governments room to pursue other objectives.”
A third reason to go slow on easing capital controls is that China’s economic reforms remain incomplete, with property rights not yet clearly defined.
In these circumstances, with China’s financial system too fragile to withstand external shocks, and the global economy mired in turmoil, the PBOC would be unwise to gamble on the ability of rapid capital-account liberalization to generate a healthier and more robust financial system.
So the real question is how the public feels about crossing the line between medical treatments for existingpeople and irreversible genetic alterations that would be passed on to future generations through genetic modification of the human germline (the sequence of germ cells,such as sperm and eggs, containing genetic material that a child may inherit).
Nevertheless, in 2011, a coalition of scientists and funders submitted a letter to former UK Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley requesting regulation revision, in order to permit the new techniques’ use in clinical treatment “once sufficient pre-clinical evidence [was] established.”
The HFEA’s own expert panel reported that the safety of mitochondrial techniques is far from being proven for current users.
The UK scientific and charitable organizations advocating mitochondrial research are proud of the permissive legislative framework that has enabled them to establish an “international lead.”
The political heat is also being turned up in the Arctic Council, a body set up to facilitate cooperation between states with Arctic territories.
Of the large oil companies, only one – France’s Total – has argued against Arctic oil exploration and exploitation on the grounds of environmental risks and economic costs.
Where are such people to be found in the Arctic?
There is, however, one way to shorten the time required to cap a well to a matter of days: drill two holes in parallel from the start.
Despite using all the means at its disposal, the world’s greatest military power managed only to create a precarious domestic stability.
Separatism was never a threat here, but ever since the Soviet invasion in 1979, the country has been a theater of war for global and regional conflicts.
The lessons of the 1990’s aren’t difficult to understand and are too important to ignore.
The West wants to withdraw from Afghanistan and will surely do so.
The severe recession, combined with the financial crisis during 2008-2009, worsened developed countries’ fiscal positions, owing to stimulus spending, lower tax revenues, and backstopping and ring-fencing of their financial sectors.
While that could be contractionary, the gain in fiscal-policy credibility might prevent a damaging spike in long-term government-bond yields.
Japan is a net creditor and largely finances its debt domestically.
A disorderly rush to the exit could lead to a dollar collapse, a spike in long-term interest rates, and a severe double dip recession.
They back Hezbollah – and help Iran send it weapons – because Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah’s shock troops keep the government in Beirut weak.
Today, parts of the ruling Ba’ath elite worry about Syria’s deepening alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah.
Besides, widespread revulsion against Syria for its alleged role in the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, particularly among Lebanon’s Maronites, Sunnis, and Druze, means that Lebanon is unlikely to ever become totally subservient again – that is, unless Hezbollah gets to call the shots.
So America and Europe must help him reach this conclusion.
A similar challenge now faces North Africa and the Middle East, where most Arab countries are experiencing massive upheavals.
Even in tiny Bahrain, the Sunni minority has, for now, succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority, albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries.
Yet, even in Egypt, the challenges are enormous.
But a context in which a fundamentalist Islamic group like the Muslim Brotherhood is the strongest organization in society, with very little effective countervailing powers, creates a serious challenge.
BERKELEY – For 15 months, the United States Federal Reserve, assisted by the financial regulators of the US Treasury, have been trying to make the macroeconomic consequences of the American mortgage-backed securities financial crisis as small as possible – trying, above all, to avoid a deep depression.
The logic behind that decision was that, previously in the crisis, equity shareholders had been severely punished when their firms were judged too big to fail.
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy created an extraordinary and immediate demand for additional bank capital, which the private sector could not supply.
But then the same people typically smile and point out that investors from other parts of the world still want to lend the US vast amounts of money, keeping long-term interest rates low and allowing the country to run big deficits for the foreseeable future.
But modern financial history, including in emerging markets, strongly indicates otherwise.

The Bernanke-Admati-King view suggests that the Washington Fiscal Consensus is seriously deficient.
On the way to meet her, I passed women walking through mud to the market with large loads of fruit and vegetables stacked on their heads.
At the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), we believe that farming, regardless of size or scale, must be seen as a business, and smallholder farmers as small-scale business owners rather than poor people who need handouts.
As a result, yields are generally too low to allow the millions of rural households to generate marketable surpluses.
Each link in the value chain, from the smallholder to the local trade agents and agro-processors to regional and national markets, needs to be strengthened.
But, of course, such threats are not unique to Asia.
The world remains concerned about nuclear activities in North Korea and Iran, and there is widespread support for efforts to address these concerns by peaceful means.
We have seen the WMD Commission led by Hans Blix, the New Agenda Coalition, and Norway’s Seven Nation Initiative.
Second, the Security Council’s permanent members should begin discussions on security issues in the nuclear disarmament process. They could unambiguously assure non-nuclear-weapon states that they will not be subject to the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons.
If there is real, verified progress on disarmament, the ability to eliminate the nuclear threat will grow exponentially.
Moreover, the reserves built up over the preceding decade were, in many cases, used to offset some of the capital outflows.
The exception was China, where the renminbi held steady against the dollar, causing an initial appreciation against almost every other currency.
Complex securities that are hard to value will be sharply limited as a matter of policy.
At the same time, a renewed emphasis on maximizing the domestic market’s potential to drive growth and structural diversification – though clearly higher in the larger, higher-income developing economies – is a useful lesson of the crisis.
Social exclusion in industrial countries imposes costs throughout society that policymakers must address with effective and targeted measures.
In countries coming out of war or other conflicts, efforts at inclusion are futile in stagnant economies.
Low-income countries in the normal process of development, for example, receive steady inflows of official foreign assistance of about 3% of their gross national income.
Given lower labor costs, local businessmen could decide to invest under the conditions of uncertainty and high risk that characterize post-conflict situations.
I also renewed my support for a subsidy to companies for their ongoing employment of low-wage workers. (Singapore adopted this idea with enviable results.)
Another round of global stimulus after the downturn is over or nearly so would push world interest rates up and drive investment activity down.
Not all the instruments for creating that prosperity are known, of course.
Moreover, what others think – particularly, what rivals are doing – may have a big effect on the results of a decision and much of what others understand and plan is private, thus inaccessible.
Hedge funds, venture capital firms that actually venture into new things, and recreated merchant banks are relatively well suited to make financial decisions that require judgment, the ability to engage the unknown, and to do so over a horizon not dictated by quarterly earnings.
The Roar of the Democratic Wave
The regime’s international legitimacy is equally in a shambles.
It is necessary that the international community:
For Europe, the best option is to support the mass movement calling for regime change led by Mohammed ElBaradei, the Nobel laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Events are showing that to be so. 
For a long time, the US has played an important role in keeping the global economy going.
Though oil prices have been dampened for now, a robust recovery could send them soaring again.
It is not as if there was a shortage of needs; it is only that those who might meet those needs have a shortage of funds.
This year will be bleak.
Countries across Africa – including Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda – are showing early signs of success.
Second, development requires both money and the right conditions.
Those who are willing to engage often demand steep risk premiums that dramatically increase the cost of capital, often to usurious levels.
HONG KONG – Building and maintaining the infrastructure of property rights – the rules, laws, registers, and administrative and judicial structures that define, protect, and enforce such rights and regulate economic transactions – has traditionally been the responsibility of national governments.
After all, the state determines the supply of fiat money and is responsible for energy and natural-resource conservation.
The former implements policy decisions, based on economic, social, and political considerations, while profit-maximizing behavior – anchored by the state-determined price and requiring a robust PRI – determines the latter.
Herein lies the dilemma (one that China currently faces) of market-oriented reforms.
Irresponsible borrowing by governments in international credit markets requires irresponsible lending.
Government bonds, on the other hand, have no covenants.
Lending to states thus involves unfathomable risks that ought to be borne by specialized players who are willing to live with the consequences.
And, because much of the risk is borne by banks (rather than by, say, hedge funds), which play a central role in lubricating the payments system, a sovereign-debt crisis can cause widespread harm.
CAMBRIDGE – The US Federal Reserve’s desperate attempts to keep America’s economy from sinking are remarkable for at least two reasons.
The Fed pumped money into the US economy and slashed its main interest rate – the Federal Funds rate – from 3.5% in August 2001 to a mere 1% by mid-2003.
After all, if they defaulted on their loans, the banks would repossess the house at a higher value.
Banks’ balance sheets were by then filled with vast amounts of risky mortgages, packaged in complicated forms that made the risks hard to evaluate.
If it pushes too hard on continued monetary expansion, it won’t prevent a bust but instead could create stagflation – inflation and economic contraction.
As early as October 2008, when the crisis first hit, China’s government adopted a comprehensive policy package designed to prevent the economy from sliding further.
Moreover, the Chinese economy was in good shape when the global crisis hit.
That is true for developed economies no less than for a developing economy like China.
The Rules of Reconstruction
To succeed, the transition to peace requires demobilization, disarmament and reintegration of former combatants, as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation of services and infrastructure.
Elsewhere, however, disregarding the primacy of politics in a transition to peace has had tragic consequences.
Early efforts to privatize Iraq’s oil industry proved disastrous, confirming for many Iraqis that the occupying Americans were determined to “steal” the country’s wealth and thus fanning the flames of violent resistance.
Oil and gas prices are sky high, the United States is overwhelmed by serious problems in Iraq and the Middle East, and the West is divided about how it should deal with Russia.
Should instability ignite into open warfare, Russia will find it impossible to avoid the consequences.
Though Putin barely implied that the dog’s superiority indicates Russia’s domination over the US, his remark appears to be in line with his general message: don’t you ever dare to doubt our high status.
DENVER – As Russian and American diplomats prepare for a Syrian peace conference, the Middle East is experiencing convulsions not seen since the Arab Spring two years ago.
There will be no medals for effort.
US President Barack Obama was wise to have invited Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a NATO ally, to Washington for talks on Syria and the impending peace conference.
Today, Sunnis in Iraq’s Anbar province, inspired by their brethren in neighboring Syria, are organizing “tribal armies” to do battle with the Iraq national army – a challenge to central authority that no leader could ignore.
Following the Russian-Georgian war, the West is scared that Russia’s government will use its cash not just for economic purposes, but as an aggressive foreign policy tool.
The government’s Reserve Fund, created to cushion the economy from a fall in oil prices, stands at $140 billion, and the National Welfare Fund, intended mainly to solve the coming pension crisis, holds another $30 billion.
But no investment by a private Russian company has, so far, been vetoed by Western governments.
The key benefit of Russian foreign investment is not economic, but that it helps Russia become a global citizen.
Sarkozy is a man prone to following his instincts.
The same cannot be said of Sarkozy, despite his claims to the contrary.
But the global economy is slowing down, and financial markets went into a tailspin during the summer.
Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are off-limits because their bonds no longer rate as investment-grade, which means that banks are not allowed to sell them to individual savers.
Indeed, stock markets are tanking precisely because investors fear that ever-increasing risk premia in the eurozone’s peripheral countries will force them to stop consuming and investing, leading to lower German rates and thus inducing German households to reduce their consumption as well.
But even the creation of a European Monetary Fund cannot save the world economy if confidence between China and the US breaks down.
As a result, board members owe their loyalty to the managers who directly or indirectly appoint them – and thus have little incentive to dissent, lest they be punished with exclusion.
And even that would not suffice.
That is a peculiar notion of accountability.
The Science of Acupuncture
The Cochrane Collaboration, an international non-profit organization providing healthcare information, conducted a systematic review of the benefits of acupuncture, including 14 trials, of which 10 were conducted in China, involving 1,208 patients.
Part of the problem in China is choosing the patients to be studied.
More high-quality trials are needed.
Moreover, America’s ongoing demographic transformation makes it harder for candidates who are unable to reach out strongly to Latinos and other minority communities – something that Romney singularly failed to do – to carry the country.
The world’s emerging-market economies are in better shape; but, while their underlying trend growth in potential output is much higher than that of the advanced economies, there is no cyclical de-coupling.
But the concentration of income at the top – more than 90% of the gains from US economic growth in 2011, for example, went to the top 1% – is constraining broad-based recovery and leaving macroeconomic policy caught between the need for continued “stimulus” and the dangers of growing public debt and asset bubbles inflated by record-low interest rates.
One hopes that the US Congress will recognize this as well, leading to support for measures that could help hundreds of millions of people in the US and around the world.
The contraction applies not only to output and employment, as in a normal recession, but to debt and credit, and the deleveraging that typically takes many years to complete.
If governments that retain strong credit ratings are to spend scarce resources effectively, the most effective approach is to catalyze debt workouts and reductions.
These are times when central banks need to spend some of the credibility that they accumulate in normal times.
Mr. Greenspan was a strong believer, in practice if not in theory – for who could understand his theory? – that central bankers should speak in an opaque and convoluted dialect.
Voters and politicians today, it seems, fear inflation and are willing to accept occasional economic recessions and unemployment above its natural rate as unfortunate but inevitable consequences of the necessary and beneficial pursuit of long-term price stability.
So we really don't know whether we should tell central bankers to brush up on their Greenspanese.
Its value to Massachusetts is exemplified in the Commonwealth’s post-independence state constitution, ratified in 1780, which includes a section about the university’s function and boundaries.
Inspired by Harvard’s success, other universities – starting with Yale University and the College of William and Mary – took similar action.
Given their intimate knowledge of the university, alumni are also the most effective leaders.
As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office.
Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania.
Indeed, this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world.
But, in the former communist bloc, the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable.
And yet the friends to whom I spoke encouraged me to get circumcised.
She sat on a traditional stool and spread her legs wide apart.
Only last month, in Narok, the town nearest my childhood village, a 13-year-old girl died after undergoing circumcision as a preparation for her marriage to a man who already had five wives.
At the same time, much more needs to be done to combat the practice, in Kenya and everywhere in Africa where it continues.
One might think that a country that owns foreign oil can use the profits from sales to insulate its economy from high world oil prices.
For example, in large countries like the United States or China, which account for a significant portion of world demand, the world price of oil is likely to be high when the country is growing strongly and citizens have lots of income, whereas the price is likely to be low when the country is doing poorly.
Indeed, one can imagine black marketeers and smugglers buying where grain is available and transporting it to sell to countries where it is not.
But the manner in which they are growing is dramatically different.
According to this “law” – which is now conventional wisdom – industrialization is the only route to rapid economic development for developing countries.
This indicates that services are not simply responding to domestic demand (which would be higher in China), but also to export opportunities.
The globalization of services, however, provides alternative opportunities for developing countries to find niches, beyond manufacturing, where they can specialize, scale up, and achieve explosive growth, just like the industrializers.
In August 1982, Mexico threatened to default, and was quickly followed by other large borrowers, notably Argentina and Brazil.
Brady’s plan looked like a great success.
That may have been plausible, but the two banks also wanted to demonstrate publicly that they had better balance sheets than their weaker rivals.
There is certainly plenty of frustration about the implementation of austerity, and no real indication of the long-term sustainability of reform efforts in southern Europe.
The Shadow of Depression
For example, labor-force participation, which usually stops falling and starts rising after the business-cycle trough, has been steadily declining over the past two and a half years.
Rather, the risk stems from governments’ refusal, when push comes to shove, to match aggregate demand to aggregate supply in order to prevent mass unemployment.

Some feel that their religion is the most important thing to them, and that that’s where their first loyalty will always lie.
The modern Pakistani identity is shaped largely by the negation of an Indian-Hindu identity and the adoption of a global pan-Islamic charter.
But this must be a debate between people, and within people.
That is a national idea worth striving for – and Pakistan’s intellectuals, its elite, and its youth must be at the forefront of the battle.
Most analysts forecast that GDP will contract in the first half of 2008 and recover in the second half of the year.
Third, the US is experiencing its most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.
While a global recession will be averted, a severe growth slowdown will not.
Moreover, even under the most optimistic scenario, the US and the world will still be relying mainly on conventional fossil fuels until the hydrocarbon era comes to an end (which few of us will live to see).
Asia has led the way, but the past five years have been the best Latin American and Africa have enjoyed in decades.
For now, though, instead of whining about high commodity prices, governments should be shielding only their very poorest citizens, and letting the price spikes serve as a wake-up call for the rest of us.
Earlier this month, jihadi terrorists ambushed an Egyptian military base in Sinai, killing 16 Egyptian soldiers.
Israelis complained about Mubarak’s “cold peace,” but they appreciated that he adhered to the treaty’s fundamental provisions.
Moreover, Israel has practically abandoned any hope of receiving agreed gas supplies from Egypt, and has not pressed its demand that Egypt block the passage of sophisticated weapons to Gaza.
Having lost Syrian backing, it is hoping that the Egyptian Brothers will provide its kindred movement with political and logistical support.
Hamas and the Bedouins in Sinai have most likely been emboldened by the latest developments in Cairo.
Just as single mothers were irrationally castigated then, so today an equally irrational hagiography has risen around them. (Europe has more single mothers than the US, but, characteristically, has less need to moralize about them one way or the other).
The glorification of single mothers represents a collective exasperation on the part of women in America – and women who make decisions in the mainstream media.
This trend hardly signifies the end of civilization as we know it; all things being equal, most women would still prefer the simple fantasy of a supportive partner in childrearing.
The spread of irrigated farming and water-intensive industries, together with the demands of a rising middle class, have led to a severe struggle for more water.
Even denial of hydrological data in a critically important season can amount to the use of water as a political tool.
Diversion of the Brahmaputra’s water to the parched Yellow river is an idea that China does not discuss in public, because the project implies environmental devastation of India’s northeastern plains and eastern Bangladesh, and would thus be akin to a declaration of water war on India and Bangladesh.
Tibet ceased to be a political buffer when China annexed it nearly six decades ago.
Moreover, there is good reason to see inflows into emerging markets as an opportunity to strengthen domestic capital markets, rather than primarily as a threat to financial stability.
Imposing controls also spawns uncertainty about a country’s policies.
There are still huge inefficiencies in international financial markets, which remain beset by herding behavior and other pathologies.
English society was redefined as a “nation” – that is, a sovereign community of equal members.
As it spread, it carried the seeds of democracy everywhere.
The more choices for the definition of one’s identity that a society offers – and the more insistent it is on equality – the more problematic the formation of identity in it becomes.
Blaming one’s existential discomfort on external factors is a kind of self-therapy. A story is constructed, which rationalizes one’s discomfort as reflecting an awareness of some general evil.
Biased views and misconceptions among market participants introduce uncertainty and unpredictability not only into market prices, but also into the fundamentals that those prices are supposed to reflect.
The system was so successful that people came to believe in what former president Ronald Reagan called “the magic of the marketplace” and I call market fundamentalism.
It was a shocking abdication of responsibility.
Moreover, the ability of the financial authorities to stimulate the economy is constrained by the unwillingness of the rest of the world to accumulate additional dollar reserves.
BRUSSELS – Two years after the world economy suffered a nervous breakdown in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, global financial markets remain unsettled, and the recovery that started so vigorously in 2009 seems to be stalling.
During the ten years preceding the peak of the bubble in 2007, about four million jobs were lost in the US manufacturing sector, whose share in total employment fell from more than 17% to 12%.
Labor-market flexibility is always touted as a panacea, but even the highest degree of it cannot transform unemployed realtors or construction workers into skilled manufacturing specialists.
Moreover, with the introduction of the euro, Germany had the advantage of pegging its currency to Southern Europe, which was experiencing a housing boom even more extreme than in the US, thus providing German exporters with growing markets and little competition.
For much of Africa, this turn of events should mark a decisive break with endemic poverty.
One remembers the 1960’s, when the global economy’s “long boom”gave Africa a chance to save its surpluses, invest in value-added industries, and increase productivity.
Elite networks continue to conspire with foreign interests to cannibalize their economies and retain the perquisites of power: fleets of luxury cars, private jets, bank accounts in tax havens, overseas properties, consumer goods, weaponry, etc.
However sad and painful it is to admit, a fleet of slave ships docking on Africa’s shores today would be overrun by willing would-be deportees.
Financial deregulation – together with easy money – had contributed to excessive risk-taking.
Indeed, a typical full-time male worker’s income is lower than it has been in more than four decades.
The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable.
Fiscal stimulus was replaced by austerity, with predictable – and predicted – adverse effects on economic performance.
COPENHAGEN – If you had $75 billion to spend over the next four years and your goal was to advance human welfare, especially in the developing world, how could you get the most value for your money?
In total, such an investment would help more than 100 million children to start their lives without stunted growth or malnourishment.
By not sharing their food with intestinal parasites, they, too, would become more alert, stay longer in school, and grow up to be more productive adults –&nbsp;another cause that needs much more public attention.
This would allow us to understand better the technology’s risks, costs, and benefits.
By radically simplifying the myriad combinations of start and end points – the only routes were to and from Memphis – all of the packages could be delivered the next day reliably.
And so on.
They argue, further, that it is too complicated to respect individuals’ preferences, too difficult to tell them how their data is being used, and pointless to treat them as individuals.
Mint does the same for my financial data; WellnessFX for my blood biomarkers.
But consider all of the qualitative services and conditions for which individuals have different preferences, needs, and outcomes that are now more predictable.
The ILO is a tripartite organization with representatives of labor, government, and business.
The second issue concerns the unbalanced intellectual property provisions (TRIPs) of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, dictated by America's pharmaceutical and entertainment industries.
In still other areas, the Commission's report argues for more "balanced" perspectives.
This is a message the world would do well to heed, lest discontent with globalization continue to grow.
Indeed, does my friend have a right to their time? He told me that he had actually sat in a breakout group with 20 people, each of whom he wanted to meet, but he managed to talk to only two of them.
It turns out that Anderson is working on the answer to precisely this problem of asymmetry in introductions.
The service, currently in beta, is not an app; it is a full-featured workflow tool that will use machine learning over time.
Maybe my friend was lucky to speak with only two of the 20 people in his breakout group.
The private sector’s growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes.
Given China’s size and its rising share in the global market, macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials.
In economic terms, China has no choice: it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two.
Today’s buzzword in the study of life is “systems” biology.
And when it became possible to manipulate DNA in vitro, the metaphor of a “genetic program” appeared even more precise: scientists could construct experiments that corresponded to the reprogramming of cells merely by working on symbols in silicon.
Nuclear cloning, illustrated by the sheep Dolly, has made the Universal Turing Machine a highly revealing, if not all explaining, model of the cell.
Who has the right to what land?
There is something clearly wrong with that argument.
Even if some Israeli officials are guilty of a crime in encouraging settlements, does that mean that the settlers must be viewed as complicit?
The best argument that the Palestinians could make against the fence is to make it unnecessary by suppressing suicide bombings.
The Sources of Chinese Conduct
The traditionalists argue that China should assume responsibility for world affairs consistent with its status as the world’s second-largest economy, behind only the US.
Rulers who rely mostly on military or economic might divorced from morality, he argued, cannot achieve long-term success on the international stage.
In February 2010, at “Spring Festival” – one of China’s biggest holidays, marked by family reunions – Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said that the government should help people live with dignity and happiness.
But what of the future? The recent rise in long-term interest rates is just the beginning of an increase that will punish investors who are seeking extra yield by betting on long-term bonds.
A higher rate of expected inflation would also cause the total nominal rate to be greater than 5%.
The relatively low interest rates on both short-term and long-term bonds are now causing both individual investors and institutional fund managers to assume duration risk and credit-quality risk in the hope of achieving higher returns.
Had they managed even a few more attacks similar to the ones on New York and Washington, they could have done serious damage.
While necessary in some form to protect the country, the war on terror as it played out has served to divert America’s attention and resources from the problems that it must solve in order to ensure its future prosperity and power.
New York – As spring comes to America, optimists are seeing “green sprouts” of recovery from the financial crisis and recession.
That model has broken down, and will not be replaced soon.
Repeating the Savings ampamp; Loan debacle of the 1980’s. the banks are using bad accounting (they were allowed, for example, to keep impaired assets on their books without writing them down, on the fiction that they might be held to maturity and somehow turn healthy).
Even &nbsp;were banks healthy, the deleveraging process and the associated loss of wealth means that, more likely than not, the economy will be weak.
America’s strategy for fixing its financial system is costly and unfair, for it is rewarding the people who caused the economic mess.
MADRID – “How difficult it is to die!”
In Argentina, despite the disaster of Juan Perón’s return to power in 1973, after an 18-year exile, Perónism was reincarnated in the 1980’s in the presidency of Carlos Saúl Menem, and again with the arrival of President Néstor Kirchner and, later, his wife, current President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.
Indeed, what was good enough for “Santa Evita,” as the Argentine writer Tomás Eloy Martínez called her, might be good enough for Chávez.
Did “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il suffer a heart attack in bed, or, more nobly, on a train trip while working for the welfare of his beloved people? Allegations of poisoning by the wicked imperialists are, of course, a feature of the official Kim death story.
A global food crisis.
I see a danger of retreating from the progress we have made, particularly in the realm of economic development and fairness in sharing the fruits of global growth.
Pledges have not been honored.
It may now have faded from the headlines.
We see the fruits in Nepal, Kenya and, we hope, Zimbabwe.
We must think about a new global economic order that more fully reflects the changing realities of our time.
By then, we need a shared vision of a new global climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012.
By doing so, we will set the stage for a new era of stability and global prosperity, more widely and equitably shared.
As I recall, the three of us sipped Diet Cokes, served by a Playboy bunny.
He was no longer our competitor inside our market; he was one of us, outside in a bigger, alien world, explaining our immature little industry and products to a much broader public than we could ever reach – or influence – on our own.
Openness is great, and a strategy I normally applaud: no single vendor is likely to be the best, so openness allows a broad range of suppliers to compete and differentiate so the best can emerge.

Then America’s businesses and investors discovered the Internet.
PARIS – Could the financial crisis of 2007-2008 happen again? Since the crisis erupted, there has been no shortage of opportunities – in the form of inadequate conclusions and decisions by officials – to nurture one’s anxiety about that prospect.
It worked then, but it cannot work now, in large part because it contributed to the new, looming crisis in financial markets brought on by countries’ soaring public-debt burdens.
The euro is an important collective step forward, but to insure its credibility as a truly common currency, it should be treated as the embodiment of a true and whole-hearted solidarity.
But the necessary financial measures can no longer be implemented while respecting states’ traditional and full sovereignty.
In October the US was on the cusp of the most significant turning point for inflation in the last 20 years.
Indeed, it seems unlikely that governments in China and similar emerging markets can compensate swiftly enough to boost domestic consumption.
But if nominal interest rates stay positive, while inflation is negative, then real interest rates may become too high for an economy in recession, causing recession to become more severe and prolonged.
Finally, there are two major differences between the 1930’s and the present.
Many African countries have used the past decade to put in place sound and sustainable economic policies that have delivered robust growth and low inflation. Together with debt relief, these policies have resulted in low levels of public debt, relatively sound financial systems, and – most important – rising living standards.
My view is that strong policies on the African side, with strong support from the international community, offer the best prospects for sustained growth and poverty reduction in Africa.
We are working closely with our 53 African members on crafting the appropriate policy response.
Our shared objective is clear: to ensure that Africa not only weathers the immediate storm, but emerges from it stronger.
We also know beyond doubt that emissions from human activities have substantially increased the amount of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) in our atmosphere.
Polls of climate researchers, as well as analysis of thousands of scientific publications, consistently show a 97-98% consensus that human-caused emissions are causing global warming.
But, before millions of people are submerged, many will be struck by extreme weather events.
Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang – the top two officials in China’s new governing council (the Standing Committee of the Politburo) – are both well educated, well traveled, and sophisticated thinkers who bring a wealth of experience to the many challenges that China faces.
Indeed, having overseen China 2030 – an extraordinary joint report recently produced by the World Bank and China’s own high-level think tank, the Development Research Center – he has a deep understanding of the roadmap that China must embrace.
In fact, China is emerging in reasonably good shape from yet another global slump.
As is the case in any country’s leadership transition, no one knows for certain whether China’s incoming administration is up to the multiplicity of challenges that they face.
·        Positive stress, for which a person feels rewarded by surmounting a challenge.
Repeated stress causes neurons in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex to shrink and lose connections with other nerve cells, while it also causes neurons in the amygdala to grow and form new connections.
Although the causes of these gradients of health are very complex, they are likely to reflect, with increasing frequency at the lower end of the scale, the cumulative burden of coping with limited resources and stressors as well as differences in lifestyle, and the resulting allostatic overload that this burden places on the physiological systems involved in adaptation and coping.
In fact, one would be hard pressed to find broad agreement with Hollande’s assessment anywhere in Europe.
Austerity reduced the number of employed workers, particularly those with low skill and productivity levels.
Europe must find more effective policies that reduce production costs toward German levels.
After all, a fixed exchange rate or common currency requires limits on fiscal independence.
In the 1990’s, its corporate sector was plagued by “triangular debts” (when a manufacturer that has not been paid for its product is unable to pay its suppliers, which in turn struggle to pay their suppliers).
At the end of 2011, China’s Treasury-bond debt stood at ¥7.2 trillion, and its ratio of foreign debt to foreign-exchange reserves reached 21.8%, having grown by 27% since 2010.
The latter two are difficult to liquidate.
China’s non-financial corporate debt accounts for roughly 62% of total debt – 30-40% higher than in other countries.
The world watches and wonders whether China will follow Japan’s path and emerge as a fully modern yet peacefully inclined country.
Although reconnaissance flights by Russia’s Air Force frequently occur in Japan’s northern skies, both countries understand the need for caution in their actions.
South of Okinawa is Yonaguni Island, with a population of just 1,800 and visible from Taiwan on a clear day.
By controlling the sea lanes, China hopes to gain leverage over India’s capacity for economic growth.
The Struggle for Syria
The current regime in Syria, in its ruthless quest to remain in power, refuses to acknowledge peaceful protesters' demands for freedom and dignity.
For them, peaceful, gradual change is the best option. And that requires a national dialogue, overseen by the international community, aimed at bolstering internal unity – and thus at protecting the country from regional interference.
In fact, this seasonal upsurge in sugar consumption is just part of a huge transition in world health that is now underway.
Many countries are now afflicted by a double burden of diseases.
Education ministers should demand healthy school meals.
The growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health.
Pakistan desperately needs the EU’s vaunted expertise in police training.
Sensing Zardari’s weakness, his main rival, Nawaz Sharif, is said to be plotting a political comeback.
But, in order to be taken seriously by the US, the EU needs to bring well-developed, well-resourced policies to the table, rather than 27 half-baked ideas. So a second reason for revamping the EU’s Pakistan policy is to be able to help shape US policy rather than be a passive by-stander.
If the EU wants to be a serious global player to which the US turns as a credible partner (showing up at its summits, for a start), the Pakistan-EU summit is a good opportunity to start replacing words with action.
Unfortunately, the two countries stand on opposing sides on climate change.
The Chinese acknowledge that they enabled Americans to borrow and spend beyond their means by parking China’s massive foreign reserves in US government securities.
Indeed, Chinese trade and investment are spurring market activity in North Korea’s northern region.
MEXICO CITY – The Summit of the Americas, which takes place roughly every three years, could be viewed as the sort of Latin American boondoggle that convenes heads of state for a few days, either south or north of the Rio Grande, to make endless speeches that lead nowhere.
Obama did not take the bait: an accidental photo opportunity or public debate with Raúl Castro in the middle of an election campaign is not how a US president wins a second term.
Nevertheless, whereas only a smattering of political leaders and intellectuals advocated legalization in the past, nowadays officials are coming “out of the closet” on drugs in droves. Those who used to say that they favored a debate on the issue now support legalization; those who opposed it now accept the need for debate; and those who continue to oppose legalization do so on moral, rather than rational, grounds.
That dignity is vanishing.
These links raise the question of the real objective of the Japanese police, a bureaucratic behemoth, in their investigation of the Sumo circle.
The gangs then upheld classic Japanese virtues of manliness and loyalty – and paid for mistakes by slicing off one of their fingers in atonement.
The Sumo gambling scandal, indeed, may be a prelude to it.
Thus, there is a well-founded fear that the planet’s natural resources (broadly defined) and recuperative capacities will not withstand the pressure.
As a result, many developed countries have built up dangerously large public debts and even larger non-debt liabilities, owing to unsustainable growth patterns.
If sustainability is to triumph, it must be predominantly a bottom-up process.
In a similar way, transportation can become less energy-intensive without restricting mobility.
The Suzuki Alliance
Currently, Maruti Suzuki India Limited has more than 4,000 employees and a nationwide sales network of 337 dealers with 8,600 salespersons.
Today, however, Japanese driving schools suffer from a fall-off in students, which cannot be explained solely by declining population.
The key point today is that the governments in both India and Japan are keen on developing their strategic consensus about Asia’s future, a fact underscored by the many bilateral discussions between defense and military officials of both countries that are taking place.
The Geneva Conversion
More broadly, America’s supply of moralistic – and even churlish – advice to the rest of the world has greatly exceeded international demand for it.
Call it a “reset” button – like the one then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave to Lavrov in 2009 – or whatever one wants.
The world needs all hands on deck – not only Russian and American, but also Arab, Chinese, European, and anyone else’s.
But even in the US, losers’ losses are outweighed by winners’ gains.

Greg Mankiw thought a bunch of reporters were coming to talk to him about the state of the economy and the analysis made by the Council of Economic Advisers in its “2004 Economic Report of the President.”
What can we do about this? The answer is simple, and it is a matter of demand, not supply.
According to this view, every great power needs obedient satellite countries.
Whenever Russia applies pressure, he immediately starts yelling about Moscow’s “ingratitude” – proclaiming that “10,000,000 Belarusians protect Russia from NATO’s tanks.”
For Russia, this could mean (in the best case) tens of thousands of refugees or (in the worst case) the arrival of armed militias on its territory.
Bakiyev seems to have said: so, you are worried about the American military presence in Central Asia, and you want to confront it.
Here is a simple formula for assessing a country’s approach to combating terrorism: credibility + transparency + integrity of approach = legitimacy and effectiveness.
Eric Holder, the US attorney general, was even more explicit about the Times Square episode: “We know that they (the Pakistan Taliban) helped direct it.
According to Brian Fishman, a terrorism expert at the US Military Academy at West Point, the growth in suicide attacks poses a severe challenge to Pakistan, for a “whole milieu of militant groups, and individuals have come together ideologically…to embark on mission(s) that Al Qaeda set(s) for them.”
Deep and sustained anger across the country – at its demonstrated vulnerability to terror and at the multiple institutional failures that allowed such loss of life – has prompted the resignations of the Home Minister in the national government and the Chief Minister and his Deputy in the state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital.
The interrogation of the one surviving terrorist, and evidence from satellite telephone intercepts and other intelligence, has led to an emerging international consensus that the attacks were masterminded by the Wahhabi-inspired Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist group once patronized, protected and trained by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as a useful instrument in their country’s proxy war against India in Kashmir.
Though some hotheads in India now call for military action, including strikes on terrorist facilities in Pakistani territory, this would certainly lead to a war that neither side could win.
The Terror Next Door
Saudi Arabia, unlike Yemen, has supposedly created a “model” system for reintegrating and re-educating Guantánamo returnees.
Since then, Yemeni labor has been banned from Saudi Arabia.
Yet there are things the Saudis can do to vaccinate themselves, and Yemen, from fanaticism.
But if Yemen’s masses are not to become more radicalized, they will need to be incorporated into an economic zone that offers hope for the future.
While these pseudo-religions collapsed, a benevolent ideology of social democracy dominated much of Europe.
This change in political direction coincided with ­- indeed, was perhaps responsible for - the process that we now call globalization.
Indeed, it was no more than an episode.
If Schroeder gave way to the Christian Democrats, indeed even if President Bush lost to his Democrat challenger, this would not imply the dawn of a new age.
The European house is ablaze, and Downing Street is calling for a rational and resolute response by the fire brigade.
As a consequence, chaos looms in Greece, as does the prospect of subsequent bank runs in Spain, Italy, and France – and thus a financial avalanche that would bury Europe. And then?
Ultimately, that means guaranteeing the eurozone’s survival with Germany’s economic might and assets: unlimited acquisition of the crisis countries’ government bonds by the European Central Bank, Europeanization of national debts via Eurobonds, and growth programs to avoid a eurozone depression and boost recovery.
Do we Germans understand our pan-European responsibility? It certainly does not look that way.
Had the majority of legislators gotten their way, many of Poland’s 3.2 million Jews would have gone meatless.
Shechita is an indispensable, non-negotiable part of Jewish religious life.
Granted, the term sounds archaic; but the Torah is the first systematic legislation that forbids cruelty to animals and mandates that they be treated with consideration and respect.
Likewise, in Poland, following a Constitutional Court ruling in November 2012 that struck down on technical grounds a provision permitting religious slaughter, the government promised that the practice would remain legal.
For my part, and for many years now, I have tried to highlight the sweet.
Indeed, only after the US-led invasion did Iraq become a breeding ground for terrorists.
Only years after the war began did the administration order the specially armored vehicles that would have saved the lives of many killed by roadside bombs. Not wanting to reintroduce a draft, and finding it difficult to recruit for an unpopular war, troops have been forced into two, three, or four stress-filled deployments.
The war has had only two winners: oil companies and defense contractors.
And it may seem particularly self-absorbed to focus on the economic costs to America, which embarked on this war in violation of international law.
Each day, these diseases kill 16,000 people—devastating entire communities and plummeting countries deeper into poverty.
Stemming the spread of this deadly trio of diseases is the linchpin in the global fight against poverty.
Since the Global Fund was founded three years ago, it has built an impressive track record: approving 310 grants totaling $3.1 billion in 127 countries and disbursing $920 million since 2002. Despite the scope of its mission, it has a minimal bureaucracy, which allows for a flexible response to changing needs.
But will the resulting loss in purchasing power bring an end to the Japanese economy’s fragile recovery, as many fear?
What is required is easy fiscal policy today, together with plans to achieve fiscal rectitude in the long run.
Such a gradual path has positive implications for monetary policy, too.
As in Japan, such measures would enhance long-run fiscal sustainability without weakening demand at a time when the economy has not yet fully recovered from the Great Recession.
Bold measures like those envisaged by Abenomics may help.
Tobin was concerned about excessive fluctuations in exchange rates.
Meanwhile, investors with longer time horizons going after significant returns would not be much deterred by the tax.
Others argued that such a tax fails to target the underlying incentive problems in financial markets, as if we had an effective, well-proven alternative to achieve that end.
For all of these problems we will need other macroeconomic and financial remedies.
Given that outstanding loans already amount to nearly double China’s GDP – a result of the country’s massive stimulus since 2008 – new loans are largely being used to pay off old debts, rather than for investment in the real economy.
Given that China was moving toward such reforms before the 2008 global economic crisis prompted former Premier Wen Jiabao to launch his ¥4 trillion stimulus plan, Xi’s statement suggests that the new government will seek to restore the economy’s pre-2008 fundamentals.
But, over the last decade, structural changes to China’s economy have caused unemployment pressure to decline significantly – a trend that can be corroborated by across-the-board wage increases.
They then transported Tuychiyev to a police station in Angren, 100 kilometers south of the capital.
Two months prior to the gathering, a United Nations special reporter published a paper condemning Uzbekistan for “widespread and systematic” use of torture.
Those who have been released prefer to keep silent about their experiences.
The Tragedy of President Chen
The world has largely deserted Taiwan and its 23 million people – the only democracy among 1.2 billion Chinese.
As a result, big international corporations and Wall Street banks now flock to China, bypassing Taiwan.
Instead, Chen’s futile effort to “de-Sinicize” Taiwan created a wastefully divisive contentious society, pitting “mainlanders” and “locals” against each other.
But instead of finishing his career in triumph, or at least with an ovation, he was ejected from the final for head-butting an Italian player.
Zidane offered neither of these romantic images.
At a time when, in France as in the rest of the world, the chasm between the elite and ordinary people has never been so wide, when the smugness of the affluent has never been so cruelly felt by the less fortunate, Zidane, a son of despised immigrants, became an international star, and yet preserved the simplicity of his origins.
How should we assess the state of transatlantic relations nowadays? With a nod to Wall Street, we can say that the Alliance is up, Europe is flat, and the United States is clearly down.
He is the son of immigrants, the outsider whose rise to the top is living proof of French openness.
While Sarkozy claims that Europe is his priority, his methods seem to contradict his intentions.
In this new context, solidarity is as crucial as ever.

But his command of detail and argument was rock solid.
The truth appears to be that his muse deserted him sometime in the first year of his presidency.
He is not a man whose identity was handed to him by birth.
And if he is elected, it is this man who will govern.
More importantly, they are needed in the long term, because a world crowded with 6.8 billion people (and rising) simply cannot sustain economic growth unless it adopts sustainable technologies that economize on scarce natural resources.
The world’s major cities are clogged with traffic jams and pollution.
This is also a recipe for global failure, and even future conflict.
This is the time and place to launch the global drive toward sustainability.
The change is happening earlier and faster in the advertising sector, where the Internet and mobile phones are making it easier both to find out about people and their behavior and to track the ads they see and the products they buy.
With a drug, you need people who are sick, or susceptible to the condition your drug can prevent. They will come to you (often via targeted ads, as it happens, or through doctors).
Now there are a number of diagnostic tests, akin to marketers’ rules of thumb, for certain conditions.
Drug companies want to sell their drugs to everyone who could possibly benefit, and the idea of serving only a limited customer base for each drug disturbs them – even as regulators also may be slow to understand the benefits of individual drug-targeting and may not approve reimbursements for the relevant tests.
Now consider recent financial innovations.
CDSs magnified the size of the bubble by hugely speeding up the velocity of monetary circulation. The CDO market grew from $275 billion to $4.7 trillion from 2000 to 2006, whereas the CDS market grew four times faster, from $920 billion in 2001 to $62 trillion by the end of 2007.
For the counterpart of the US debt build-up was the relocation of much American manufacturing capacity to China.
Greenspan is the sacrifice they offer to the god of the market.
PARIS – In democracies, justice is supposed to be independent.
In Italy, prosecutors in Rome, following the lead of their colleagues in Milan, are now going after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Kirchner is not above suspicion, but the judges’ lack of a watertight legal case raises suspicions of a political motive.
His targets, however, almost invariably come from the political right.   But rather than pursuing such an open ideological agenda, most activist magistrates tend to act as a corporation: their motives can be politicized, but their professional, guild interests come first.
Democracy is supposedly based on a separation and balance of institutional power.
This Kafkaesque turn of events was possible because Pavel has mental health issues in a system that refuses to protect his rights.
But when he was subsequently detained in a psychiatric hospital, the Russian government refused to allow the lawyer access to his client.
The ECHR has now cleared a path for the tens of thousands of other people in Russia who suffer abuse at the hands of the very mental health system that is supposed to help them.
Europe, however, has always found it difficult to come to terms with an over-confident, let alone arrogant, Germany.
In the first round of French presidential elections, the extreme right and left received more than 30% of the vote, with Martine Le Pen’s anti-EU National Front threatening to supplant the center-right Union for a Popular Movement as the country’s new mainstream rightist party.
Spain’s capacity to withstand an austerity “cure” that only sinks it deeper into recession must also have its limits.
Students organized a small rally in the old Vyšehrad cemetery, the burial grounds of Smetana and Dvořák in a fortress overlooking the city.
The theme music was the Velvet Underground.
Here were our children, bloodied and beaten. Here were our children, finally, victorious.
Slowly, it snaked down the medieval streets behind Prague Castle and into the square in front of the president's palace.
Never in my life have I seen anything so beautiful. I doubt I ever will again.
Keynes argued not only that markets are not self-correcting, but that in a severe downturn, monetary policy was likely to be ineffective.
US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has tried hard to avoid having the blame fall on the Fed for deepening this downturn in the way that it is blamed for the Great Depression, famously associated with a contraction of the money supply and the collapse of banks. 
The Federal government has assumed trillions of dollars of liabilities and risks.  In rescuing the financial system, no less than in fiscal policy, we need to worry about the “bang for the buck.”
Has there been a change of heart, or only a change in strategy? After all, in today’s context, the pursuit of Keynesian policies looks even more profitable than the pursuit of market fundamentalism!
Like Bo, both men had been members of the CCP Central Committee, the Party’s inner circle – a status that allowed them to escape a death sentence (unlike the lower-ranking former Minister of Railways Liu Zhijun following his conviction on similar charges of corruption and abuse of power).
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has already scrapped charges of illicit sexual relations involving several women, signaling that such crimes are to remain hidden when Central Committee members commit them.
Their tragedy stands as a profound indictment of the CCP’s rule, because no family is safe when governments are not subject to the rule of law.
O, you are men of stones.”
And, for a little more than a decade, from 1997-2007, this hope was realized.
And, incidentally, the current agitation about interest rates is a bit over the top.
These could be justified during the recession of 2008-2009, but now they have become counter-productive, because they undermine the markets’ controlling function.
PARIS – America’s presidential election campaign is being followed in Europe with passionate interest.
America is no longer the protector or model that it used to be, nor is it alone in terms of influence and power.
The implicit question behind some European reservations about Obama may be formulated in one question: “Will we have to do more in Afghanistan and beyond?”
So Europeans are right to be fascinated by America’s presidential election.
With the economic policies Taylor criticizes, this mechanism simply does not exist.
And that is one thing they will never do.
There is indeed something wrong with today’s interest rates.
The problem is not the 12 Class-A war criminals interred at the shrine; the real problem is the Yushukan military museum next door.
My exposure to the Japanese right came in the early 1990’s, when I was on a couple of panels in Japan with Watanabe Soichi, who was selected by my Japanese publisher (unbeknownst to me) to translate my book The End of History and the Last Man into Japanese.
Since the final days of the Cold War, the US has been pushing Japan to rearm, and has officially supported a proposed revision of Article 9 of the postwar constitution, which bans Japan from having a military or waging war.
A clear example is financial regulation, which in many ways is a form of paternalism.
But some amount of paternalism is necessary in civilized societies.
Sunstein and Thaler would have the employer choose a default option that works for most people, such as 60% in equities, 30% in bonds, and 10% in money-market funds.
This, then, is the nub of the problem.
The Trouble with Poland
In the nineteenth century, Europe’s southern and eastern extremities were united by common decay.
And perhaps there is another factor: there is more pride and less self-doubt in Spanish culture than in the Polish one.
By antagonizing Germany, indeed all of the EU, Poland is merely encouraging a revisionist Russia.
Sadly, there is a “disconnect” between Poland’s economic progress and the discourse and behavior of its politicians.
But that doesn’t mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be subjected to cool, hard economic analysis.
So it is no surprise that its figure of $500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come.
But the costs don’t stop there.
In short, even our “moderate” estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America’s involvement in Iraq.
NEW YORK – In their preoccupation with fiscal deficits, developed-country policymakers continue to neglect a different, yet equally critical, shortfall: the trust deficit between advanced and emerging economies when it comes to global governance.
While the world economy is expected to grow by 3.3% this year, average annual growth in the advanced countries is projected to be just 1.2%.
Mexico, for example, recently adopted – ahead of schedule – the changes in capital requirements for banks recommended by the Third Basel Accord (Basel III), in order to reduce leverage and increase stability.
Many hundreds of scientists from different countries were involved as contributors and reviewers for these reports, which are probably the most comprehensive and thorough international assessments on any scientific subject ever carried out.
Such stabilization would also eventually stop further climate change.
In fact, the IEA lists many benefits that will be realized if its recommendations are followed.
As I don’t expect nations to abandon this principle, NATO will continue to depend on individual allies and their willingness to commit resources.
In Afghanistan, for example, national systems for friendly-force tracking, which are vital to preventing accidental attacks on one’s own forces or allies, are not compatible.
During the past couple of years, NATO’s funding policy has been updated to allow common funding to be used as an incentive for the provision of certain theater-level enabling capabilities, like medical facilities, airports handling troops and supplies, or intelligence.
The extraordinary international response to the tsunamis that devastated South Asia is a remarkable political phenomenon.
In contrast, the countries that are most generous – Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and tiny Luxemburg – give proportionately far more than American governmental and private assistance combined, and the lion’s share of their aid goes to the world’s most impoverished countries.
Another question likely to loom large in coming months is whether assistance is politicized and free of corruption.
Yet it was never able to use the former to advance the latter.
While it is too early to predict the final outcomes, several important regional implications are already beginning to emerge.
Many Arabs regard the brand of moderate Islam espoused by Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as a possible model for the Middle East.
Moreover, the Turkish model owes much to the leadership of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic.
As a result, the collapse of the old power structures in many Middle East countries is likely to be accompanied by considerable political turmoil and violence.
Overall, however, the movement has remained peaceful and even joyous.
That has weakened center-left parties.
The democratic opposition can address the flaws of the existing order only if it recognizes the need for very different forms of mobilization from those of the past.
Recent weeks have seen the trial of former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and the conviction of former Defense Minister Charles Pasqua.
The apex of the aristocratic Republic was reached under the Socialist President François Mitterrand, who ruled from 1981 to 1995.
So, something of a democratic revolution may be underway in France.
Today, many French journalists still resist the temptation to expose the private lives of the political elite.
French ministers have yet to be seen taking the bus or the subway to their offices.
But few international leaders face such a wide range of sworn domestic enemies.
Some in Washington charge that he has done too little to roust al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters from safe havens along the country’s border with Afghanistan.
The generals know that another coup would further weaken the military’s popular standing – as well as Pakistan’s relations with the US – at a moment when Bhutto and Sharif have raised expectations at home and abroad for a permanent return to civilian rule.
The Bush administration can therefore enthusiastically back a return to civilian rule and claim a much-needed victory for democracy in a Muslim country.
Perhaps the greatest display of this political schizophrenia took place last month in Red Square, where a witch’s brew of Red “Victory” flags, tri-color “Imperial” flags, Stalin portraits, and Orthodox icons marched side by side during the 60th anniversary celebration marking WWII’s end.
Indeed, Putin’s signature characteristic is to be all men for all Russia’s people.
He became known as “The Peasants’ Tsar,” though he didn’t tolerate any opposition thinking contrary to his own.
Like a bad driver, a nation that looks left and right but never ahead is bound to crash.
That damage is all the greater when we consider how America’s trade subsidies contributed to the demise of the Doha Round.
America and other advanced countries are the real losers from the demise of the Doha Round.
Europe’s National Wild Cards
This problem is perhaps most evident in the United Kingdom.
As a result, British officials appear more likely to develop proposals that suit only the UK, and that could give it an unfair advantage.
And the European Court of Justice would have difficulty reconciling a special set of exceptions for one country with the shared rights and freedoms on which the EU is based.
Then on 12 November, the world’s Nobel Peace Laureates will hold a summit in Hiroshima to stress the priority of nuclear disarmament and affirm their commitment to promoting it.
Yes, nuclear disarmament has gone viral.
One of the most important and overdue developments in this area is the entry into force of the CTBT, which will outlaw all nuclear explosions, regardless of their size, location, or declared purpose.
Other treaties are needed as well, especially one outlawing the production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.
Up to a point, this is understandable.
In July 1995, Serb forces attacked.
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning "anti-Tutsi extermination."
He is the all-time Teflon diplomat.
Annan cannot plead that he faced any risk to his personal safety, whereas Wallenberg in 1944 and 1945 was in constant peril.
As a result, even countries with good regulatory systems are now confronting problems in their financial sectors.
But many developing countries have just emerged from being overburdened with debt; they do not want to go through that again.
Emblematic of the difference between the UN and the G-20 conferences was the discussion of bank secrecy: whereas the G-20 focused on tax evasion, the UN Conference addressed corruption, too, which some experts contend gives rise to outflows from some of the poorest countries that are greater than the foreign assistance they receive.
Of course, the UN has played a leading role on climate change before now.
China and India were absent at the time, and Russia was hostile to the idea.
More than half of the 43 members of the Association of Small Island States believe that the decision to do nothing, to let ocean waters rise, can be considered tantamount to approval of murder.
But that re-boot must start now, and the UN, specifically the General Assembly, is the place to begin.
The answer, alas, is a failing grade.
Among G-8 countries, only the UK is making a bold effort to increase its overall aid budget and direct a significant portion to Africa.
First, the Gleneagles commitments might be mere words to politicians in the rich world, but they are matters of life and death for the world’s poor.
But it is tragic to spend so much money and then accomplish next to nothing in terms of concrete results and honest accountability. 
Alternative Fiscal Medicine?
But how many will become exhausted before implementing this program in full? Willingly or not, some may seek recourse to inflation or administrative measures aimed at trapping domestic savings into financing the state and keeping bond rates low (what economists call financial repression) – or, eventually, to outright debt restructuring.
Start with equity.
On distributional grounds, there does not seem to be a good reason to resort to them in lieu of relying on outright taxation.
After all, they were not the beneficiaries of the public goods or transfers financed by the issuance of debt.
But an exception can again be made: When both the private and public sectors are overburdened with debt, adjustment leads to a debt-deflation spiral, particularly when conducted under a fixed exchange-rate regime.
MADRID – Barack Obama’s first year in office has been a sobering exercise in the limits of presidential power.
But creating a structure of international relations that will make a more stable and enduring world order is not a task to be completed within one year.
The Obama administration’s failure in re-launching the India-Pakistan peace talks over Kashmir is one of the gravest weaknesses of its “AfPak” strategy.
He was commendably humble to admit that he was wrong “to have raised expectations so high.”
On the policy input side, they have specified and begun to implement purchases of securities totaling $75 billion per month (three times as much, in relative terms, as the US Federal Reserve currently purchases under its unconventional monetary-policy regime).
Japan’s aging population mutes the potential impact of both the wealth effect and animal spirits.
The required reforms, though achievable, will test the government’s resolve and implementation capabilities, as well as the population’s willingness to face immediate disruptions in exchange for the promise of longer-term gains.
In other words, a growing pie for all better accommodates all.
Within three years the US had an official report on the causes of the events of 9/11; the well-resourced expert commission that produced it identified the weaknesses of America’s national-security agencies and provided recommendations for addressing them.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, chaired by Phil Angelides, did produce a report on the crisis – in fact, three reports.
Unfortunately, the Commission – composed mostly of elected officials, rather than experts – wasted its time in political squabbles.
Unfortunately, they are likely to remain unanswered without a major mandatory disclosure of data.
The American comedian Jimmy Kimmel recently poked fun at his compatriots’ lack of fiscal knowledge by asking pedestrians on Hollywood Boulevard what they thought of &#160;“Obama’s decision to pardon the sequester and send it to Portugal.”
This implies that, if anything, the tax system should become more progressive, with the proceeds invested in public goods that are not sufficiently provided by the private sector –&#160;things like early childhood education and preventive health care to minimize educational disruption resulting from common ailments like childhood asthma.
Its large budget deficits reflect the impact of tax breaks that favor the wealthy and upper middle class; an unfunded expansion of Medicare coverage to include prescription medicines; two foreign wars; and, most important, a banking system that was allowed to get out of control, inflicting massive disruption on the real economy (and thus on tax revenue).
PARIS – A year ago the eurozone was in serious trouble.
The endeavor was bound to be ambitious.
Second, an agreement on authorizing the ECB to oversee the banking sector was reached at the end of last year.
There are two ways to eliminate the feedback loop.
Meanwhile, the credibility of Draghi’s atomic weapon is being undermined.
But, 60 years later, has their discovery really had the transformative impact that the world expected?
But, almost from the beginning –&#160;and most intensely since 1971, when Time magazine published a special section entitled “The New Genetics: Man into Superman” – science and society alike have tended to overestimate the impact of genetics.
Genetics has been a source of particularly high hopes when it comes to cancer treatment.
In addition, as the cancer adjusts to the drug, further mutations are likely to occur, diminishing the drug’s efficacy.
But such patents mar DNA’s “birthday” celebrations for the patients who stand to benefit from the fruits of genetic research – if only they could afford them.
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions.
While motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality.
In an ideal world, conflicts end by agreements and treaties. But in the real world – and Cyprus, Bosnia, and Kosovo may be examples – stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end, even without formal agreement.
As it integrates into the world economy, it must seek to sustain growth while protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality.
The same report warns that, if we do not change our ways, worldwide CO2 emissions will rise exponentially.
The international community counts on China to pursue that role with vigor.
But it is deeds that matter.
The EU sets all kinds of conditions for cooperation with other countries.
A readers’ poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed 96% opposed to those proposed measures, and only 2% in support.
Reality is more complex.
Even with censorship, the Internet is a force for change.
Can’t get to a doctor?  You can check your symptoms online – but can you be sure that the medical Web site you are using is reliable?
Crucially, the Commission’s recent proposals include the creation of “mobility partnerships” with Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, aimed at facilitating travel for local students and businesspeople.
To its credit, the European Commission also issued strong calls to member states for better legislation and practices concerning migration.
The genius of modern Europe has consisted in linking long-term stability to the pursuit of ever-deeper economic and political integration.
Nor is it merely about questioning the sources of Europe’s influence in a fast-changing world.
For starters, unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment.
2.
But it is clear that they have not tried enough: the “stop” signal of unanchored inflation expectations, accelerating price growth, and spiking long-term interest rates – all of which tell us that we have reached the structural and expectational limits of expansionary policy – has not yet been flashed.
But that book was published in 2007 – before, presumably, his intellectual structure fell apart.
Indeed, early theorists of business cycles understood this.
It manages to combine technology-driven cycles of booms and recessions with markets that always clear (i.e., there is no unemployment).
But this was not used to finance new inventions: it was the invention.
For Schumpeter, there was something both noble and tragic about the spirit of capitalism.
The population of what is now Pakistan was about two-thirds Muslim; the remainder were mostly Hindus and Sikhs.
The large countries in this part of the Islamic world – most notably Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey – are attempting to address four problems, the most challenging of which is to define Islam’s role in the political system.
They have been mercilessly attacked in Karachi and Quetta in recent years, with more than 400 killed.
The upcoming election has both nurtured hope and generated anxiety among Pakistanis.
First, the eurozone is in deep recession, especially in the periphery, but now also in the core economies, as the latest data show an output contraction in Germany and France.
Infrastructure investment is down as well, with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales.
The Islamic Republic, with its back to the wall as sanctions bite, could also react by sinking a few ships to block the Strait of Hormuz, or by unleashing its proxies in the region – the pro-Iranian Shia in Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
That is yet another reason to believe that the global economy remains far from achieving a balanced and sustainable recovery.
More than 50% of Chinese live in urban areas today, up from 25% in 1990, and the proportion is expected to reach 70% by 2035.
Workers come home from their jobs to homes that are dark, dank, and depressing.
That would have been unheard of several years ago, as would today’s growing trend among China’s urban middle classes for de-urbanization – a brain drain whereby educated city dwellers give up on the rat race and return to the countryside in pursuit of cleaner air, open spaces, and better accommodation.
McKinsey calculates that the country requires between 700-900 million square meters of new residential and commercial space each year; 350-400 kilometers (217-248 miles) of metros and subways (20 times what has been achieved in the past decade); and 19,000-25,000 kilometers of annual road construction (equivalent to all the roads built over the past ten years).
The UN Charter, initially negotiated by the US, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom during World War II, established a Security Council containing five permanent members, including France and the Republic of China.
A majority of UN member states are in favor of creating a new Council with an expanded roster of both permanent and non-permanent members.
We all stand to lose if new international crises end up being addressed by coalitions of countries at the margins of the Security Council and in a manner that flouts international law.
But Alvaro Uribe’s re-election in Colombia may not only have begun the process of reversing that tide; it has perhaps also shown conservative and liberal parties across the continent a way forward – one that may soon be tested in Mexico’s presidential vote on July 2.
The slogan meant that his government intended to free up (by military means) the country’s main road networks, even when these passed through FARC territory.
However, unlike President Alan Garcia of Peru, who Chávez may be trying to bully, Chávez has been forced to recognize Uribe’s enormous popularity.
America’s Health-Care Divide
These arguments were entirely convincing to Bismarck. They are equally convincing today.
One Republican senator – Olympia Snowe of Maine – voted for it in committee, but then switched sides, threatened to kill it via filibuster, and voted against its final passage.
What will nurses and patients denied the benefits of the ACA do?
For China, the issue largely concerns the design and implementation of the next stage of institutional reforms to sustain economic growth and efficiency, reduce social inequality, remove market distortions, address environmental deterioration, and combat corruption.
First, in both countries, the challenge is not one of state versus market, but about finding complementarities between the two.
How they use monetary, fiscal, structural, institutional, and regulatory policies may differ, but each will ultimately be judged by how close he comes to achieving that goal.
For the North, it would be suicide; for the South, with its vibrant economy and widening free-trade agreements, the opportunity cost would be particularly high.
First, the regime’s implosion would unleash a massive refugee flow, implying enormous social and economic costs.
This is a good starting point.
The candidates in US debates address carefully selected journalists who rarely follow up on a question.
It is, according to the pundits, Romney’s last chance.
If policies or prejudices have not persuaded that undecided 17% of voters, they must be looking for something else.
After all, the US presidency is a quasi-monarchical institution, as well as a political one.
Then the competition – part ideological, part beauty contest – can start all over again.
The economy is showing signs of over-heating.
This has made the central government very powerful, attracting the best brains into its service. 
Then China became embroiled with Japan in a dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku Islands.
Consider Afghanistan.
That rift is unfortunate, because improvement in Chinese living standards ought to go hand-in-hand with Chinese participation in building a better world order.
Unless a deliberate effort is made by both sides to reach a better understanding, the world faces a turbulent time in 2011 and beyond.
Of course, America is no longer what it used to be.
Obama was reelected because the Republican Party lost sight of the center in America.
At the same time, while America may no longer be the international actor that it once was, domestic production of shale oil and gas appears set to re-write the US energy equation – as it could for France and other Western countries, which may one day be able to do without the energy supplied by the Middle East.
But the idea of a “rape culture” – a concept formulated by feminists in the 1970’s as they developed the study of sexual violence – has hardly made a dent in mainstream consciousness.
Women soldiers who had served in Afghanistan came forward to speak with the filmmakers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, whose Oscar-nominated film The Invisible War exposed the scale of the problem.
Researchers from Stanley Milgram to Phillip Zimbardo have shown that atrocities can be committed more easily when ordinary subjects (that is, not sociopaths) become desensitized in various ways.
Indeed, most of the US military men and women I have met long to embody the role of a warrior who acts on a bright-line understanding of the difference between right and wrong.
Of the party’s dozen presidential candidates, only two (Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman) declined to reject scientific evidence concerning global warming and its human causes.
Candidate Romney was so cowed by his party’s obsession with low taxes that he never put forth a budget that added up.
One can draw two possible conclusions from America’s election.
Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.”
This belief system did not, of course, exclude the possibility of market intervention.
And, in the wider triumph of the precepts of financial deregulation and market completion, both interests and ideology have clearly played a role.
Such guiding philosophies are most compelling when they provide clear answers.
We need to have that conversation.
This&nbsp;argument is based on the latest science about dopamine’s role in arousal (as James Pfaus and his team at Concordia University in Montreal have documented), as well as on well-established summaries of the literature, such as David Linden’s The Compass of&nbsp;Pleasure.
The fact that science is finding connections between women’s sexual experience and their emotions and perception should not be cause for mockery, but for curiosity and respectful investigation of the facts.
By expanding our grasp of the vastness of the universe, science has, if anything, increased the awe and reverence we feel when we look up on a starry night (assuming, that is, that we have got far enough away from air pollution and excessive street lighting to see the stars properly).
“Dreams and Facts” concludes with these stirring words: “No man is liberated from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it is; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is capable until he has allowed himself to see his own littleness.”
So, you finally passed that crucial piece of legislation? Your fiscally responsible political party just won the election?
The importance of a competitive currency for economic growth is undeniable.
It stimulates production (and hence employment), unlike overvaluation, which stimulates consumption.
There is little to be gained from letting hot money flow into an economy freely.
PALO ALTO – Race can undoubtedly be a tricky subject, with any suggestion of genetic differences among racial groups – beyond superficial characteristics like skin color – potentially invoking memories of the nineteenth-century eugenics movement and its eventual role in Nazi ideology.
Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit.
Given this result, US regulators approved the treatment for marketing based on a trial of only 28 patients.
But we must fight illness with the data we have, not the data we wish we had.
Unfortunately, Sartre and Aron are also joined in death: both have been disowned, ignored, or underrated by all the academic disciplines – philosophy, literature, sociology, politics – to which their voluminous works might be thought to have contributed.
As for Zola, who defended Captain Alfred Dreyfus from charges of treason fueled by anti-Semitism, he was easily convicted for libel because he merely questioned the motives of witnesses without offering any new evidence.
The intellectual’s ethic is both exhilarating and harsh, for it places responsibility for thinking squarely on the thinker’s shoulders.
Each wanted to take French society in radically different directions, but both never ceased being critical of the status quo.
We blamed unusual wind conditions in the Arctic that year. But satellite data since then have proven us wrong.
2010 was one of the two hottest years on record globally, despite extremely low solar activity. Thus, it is almost certain that warming – including in the Arctic – will continue in the coming decades.
While future sea level is hard to predict, most experts would agree that unabated global warming could lead in the coming centuries to a rise measured in meters, threatening the very existence of many coastal cities and entire island nations. Already at the end of this century, sea level could well be one meter higher than it is now, unless we act rapidly and decisively to curb our greenhouse-gas emissions.
Today, the global picture is different.
It gives us hope that US President Barack Obama recognizes these dangers.
The Preparatory Committee will meet in New York this May, and this is where the necessary decisions should be made.
We trust that the US and Russian presidents, and leaders of all other nuclear powers, will show statesmanlike wisdom and courage and begin the process of freeing the world from the nuclear menace.
It does not.
We might see prolonged and high unemployment in the construction sector, and in regions that had seen the biggest previous construction booms.
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
The Gulf War confirmed American military might and the age-old perils of appeasement.
European strategists largely dismissed America’s interpretation that force had won the Cold War, believing that cooperation had triumphed precisely because force was absent. They heard in pleas for freedom from behind the Iron Curtain not a desire to become American, but to join the remarkably successful European experiment in collective security and prosperity that emerged after World War II.
The Kremlin trusted the West in 1989.  Subsequent Russian leaders refuse to be duped again.
But, unlike Russia, China de-emphasized the relevance of traditional hard power to achieve its goals.
Yet after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse.
Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head.
This model is the current basis of the business world, just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy.
Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies.
It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, implying faster innovation and economic growth.
Many work in piles of garbage, either removing them to another place or collecting empty bottles and cans to sell.
The deterioration of families’ financial situation has also left poor children deprived of educational opportunity.
Increasingly, Iraqi girls interpret anything given to them as a means to have sex with them.
The methods are brutal evidence of a backlash by previously subdued tribal forces that have been unleashed by the occupation: women strangled and beheaded, and their hands, arms and legs chopped off.
Ironically, the forces leading this assault on women had little or no power under Saddam Hussein.
These patrols must receive gender-sensitive training and prioritize women’s security over tribal or fundamentalist religious values.
Other Turks have faced prosecution in Western Europe for saying that it did not.
The world’s different legal systems have never been in much agreement about the boundaries of free speech.
In cases where bellicose leaders make public threats to “bury” another country (remember Khrushchev?) or to wipe it off the map, the courts should wait, it was said, until some harm occurs.
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza constitute a grave threat to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean.
The efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have been dealt a severe blow.
The European Union’s feeble response to the warfare in Gaza and Lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate use of force by Israel (described as “ten eyes for one” by the Finnish presidency), thereby betraying its dependence on the US to end the violence.
The current frustration is summed up by The Economist’s recent cover headline: “Grow, dammit, grow.”
Despite many financial crises and defaults, this creditor-debtor relationship worked, on the whole, to the benefit of both sides.
Cheap money in the West was the “correct” Keynesian response to the flood of saving from the East.
The principle behind this is that collective insurance would be cheaper, and therefore less deflationary, than self-insurance.
A rising tide lifts all boats; a receding one ignites a Hobbesian war of each against all.
NEW DELHI – International discussion about China’s rise has focused on its increasing trade muscle, growing maritime ambitions, and expanding capacity to project military power.
Whereas riparian neighbors in Southeast and South Asia are bound by water pacts that they have negotiated between themselves, China does not have a single water treaty with any co-riparian country.
The Metog Dam will be twice as large as the 18,300-megawatt Three Gorges Dam, currently the world’s largest, construction of which uprooted at least 1.7 million Chinese.
And China’s dam building inside Burma to generate power for export to Chinese provinces has contributed to renewed bloody fighting recently, ending a 17-year ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army and the government.
Yet they share a root cause, whereby speculative and often narrow interests have superseded the common interest, common responsibilities, and common sense.
We have only 12 short months to hammer out the elements of a global climate change accord before world leaders convene next December in Copenhagen.
Developing nations will need increased financial support to protect the poorest and most vulnerable.
In marrying the issues of economic revitalization, energy security, and climate change, Obama has articulated clearly the benefits of any Green New Deal.
But the hit of this year’s Sundance Film Festival was a low-key affair called Inequality for All, in which Robert Reich, a labor secretary in the Clinton administration, explains how rising income inequality and the demise of the middle class is causing so many Americans to suffer.
Moreover, millions of middle-class American homes are “underwater” (the mortgage is more than the home’s underlying value).
That means large investments in public education, including higher education; substantial investments in infrastructure, funded by a highly progressive tax whose top marginal effective rate never fell below 50%; and strong labor unions.
Yet, as the world’s leading finance ministers and central bankers convene in Washington this month for the semi-annual International Monetary Fund board meetings, policy paralysis continues.
The British have nearly the opposite perspective.
The inability of backward domestic financial systems to allocate investment efficiently is a big factor pushing funds out of poor countries and into the US.
Many developing countries, however, are well on their way to achieving these preconditions.
The Way Out of Iraq
In other areas, sharia law is being introduced by force.
The initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children once learned arithmetic by counting numbers of dead Soviet soldiers.
We don’t hear about the workshops for women’s empowerment, or the successful organization of small-scale local elections across the country.  
But many analysts have challenged estimates that rely on the World Bank’s current poverty line, raised in 2008 from $1 to $1.25 per day, in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.
For example, World Bank survey data suggest that India’s per capita household expenditure has grown by only 1.5% annually since the early 1990’s, implying that the average Indian spent $720 in 2010.
While the Bank’s latest PPP-conversion rate puts the number of poor Chinese at 173 million, the previous rate would suggest that only 69 million Chinese were living below the poverty line.
Glass-Steagall also strengthened regulators’ ability to clamp down on lending for real-estate and stock-market speculation.
Nor is it obvious that the bankers suffered from more adverse publicity.
Another popular argument for the success of 1930’s reform is that Congress had already agreed on a diagnosis of the problem and could build on its own earlier efforts to treat it.
National City Bank and Chase National Bank had already announced that they were liquidating their securities affiliates.
The Weary Titan
The crisis has also intensified political problems.
An increasingly uncompetitive civilian industry, the burden of military commitments overseas, wage stagnation: all signal that the American titan may be wearying.
Of course, due to its sheer military might and numerous alliances, the US will remain on top for the foreseeable future.
The welfare state was described by its intellectual architect, Lord Beveridge, as a structure built to protect the individual “from the cradle to the grave.”
The welfare state resisted its critics and the pain of stagnating economies by making collaborators of the middle class.
Osborne’s assault on the British welfare state began with the universal child subsidy, a broad-base entitlement distributed to all families with children, regardless of their incomes.
Yet popular resistance to these supposedly unfair entitlement reductions is stronger than expected.
Tensions have existed between liberty and equality ever since modern democracy placed citizenship at the root of political legitimacy.
Intervention has now been broadened to include education, culture, sport, and ethnicity, in the belief that only citizens who receive equal education and training, and have their historical and cultural specificity recognized, can enjoy genuine equality.
With the surge in unemployment in the 1970's, for example, several new categories of beneficiaries were created and subsequently modified to adapt to funding limitations.
The West’s Middle East Pillars of Sand
But this military pillar has been steadily eroded.
Likewise, 37% of the UAE’s trade is with China, India, and South Korea.
Hosni Mubarak was the lynchpin of the West’s policy: he was uncompromising with potential US enemies; he could be relied upon to appear at peace talks with the Israelis; and he could be used to add weight to the American position on Iran.
Recently, however, the Fed decided not only to keep the punch bowl in place, but to refill it.
Central banks in emerging-market countries like Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Peru, Thailand, and South Korea are providing good examples to follow.
That seems not to be the case any more.

Yet America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same glasses: Spain's response to the terrorist attacks - a threat common to all democracies - was to vote in a government promising an end to pro-US policy on Iraq.
The messianic idealism that liberated Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies.
Anyone who thinks we are building a European rival to America has not looked properly at the facts.
We must forge greater European military capacities simply to put in place a mechanism that allows us to stand effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies, as just happened.
Our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against anybody in particular.
First, software with a slight edge tends to get a significantly greater share of the available market; and, second, the available market is global, because it costs so little to make an extra copy and send it anywhere in the world.
The more that everyone has access to the same educational opportunities, the more society will tend to accept some receiving disproportionate rewards.
The billions to be made today may only be millions tomorrow.
The Wolf that Ate Georgia
By sending its troops to South Ossetia, Georgia no doubt was politically reckless, but it did not breach any international rule, however nominal its sovereignty may be.
As a result of that perilous precedent, Russia no longer feels bound by the unwritten agreement.
The Women of Europe’s Dream
Were my father to reappear suddenly and I told him that Lithuania was a member state, he would stare in disbelief and wonder what I was smoking.
Indeed, on the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, no less a Euro-luminary than Jacques Delors expressed the fear that the EU could “unravel”; Germany’s former foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, expressed similar sentiments in an interview on the BBC in early 2009.
Lagarde has other strengths.
Perhaps the greatest challenge for Europe in the twenty-first century is to bring down the walls between its non-Muslim and Muslim communities.
Some have suggested that the president’s departure is the result of his making too many waves with his anti-corruption agenda.
For example, the Bank’s recent study The Many Faces of Corruption estimates, that illegal logging causes annual losses of about $10 billion in the forestry sector.
Now, the resolution of the crisis has reassured many that the Bank can practice what it preaches.
But gutting or cutting Doing Business would be a grave error and would essentially result in throwing a healthy baby out with the bathwater.
Moreover, Doing Business helps to break down barriers – particularly in developing countries – that can discourage the establishment of small and medium-size enterprises, provide opportunities for corruption, and drive small business owners to the informal sector.
Still others have argued that Doing Business contains built-in biases against regulation and taxation, which may create incentives for countries to enact reforms that game the system rather than produce meaningful results.
Finally, while Doing Business focuses on helping the poorest countries to improve their economic performance, it also influences advanced-country policymaking and business practices.
Thus, the rollout of the American propaganda machine for Kim, who traveled to many capitals worldwide with US Treasury support and promises of American largesse, surely biased the vote against Okonjo-Iweala.
His candidacy made Okonjo-Iweala look like a regional “African candidate,” while Ocampo was the “Latin American” candidate.
Can Kim lead on these and other issues that are beyond his experience? Foreboding is in order.
We console each other when Chelsea loses, and worry together when our team plays big clubs, like recently when they played Liverpool, the only major contender that stood between Chelsea and the English title.
They want to enjoy the game, rather than sit in the company of their male relatives, oblivious to what’s happening on the pitch.
But for most African young women and girls, it’s not that simple.
Male youth soccer camps and leagues are either nonexistent or mediocre.
It seems natural to draw connections among them, especially after a “superstorm” shut down Wall Street this past October.
Facing stresses on both systems simultaneously is like losing both engines on an airplane in mid-flight.
Each case highlights the need to consider how to make systems more resilient, which means that systems cannot be considered in isolation.
MUNICH – Since last autumn, Germany has been accused by a number of Anglo-American economists, above all by the 2008 Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, of not doing enough to combat the world economic crisis and of free-riding on other countries’ stimulus programs.
While this certainly impedes long-term economic growth and causes great structural problems, it also means that the state reacts extremely counter-cyclically and stabilizes the economy to a great extent, which benefits the entire world.
The data clearly supports this view.
The World\u0027s Runaway Train
As a result, higher commodity prices are eating into fiscal cushions rather than curtailing demand.
Wait a second, you say. Why can’t our wonderfully flexible market economies roll with the punches?
For a variety of reasons, mostly related to government intervention, few emerging market economies can be categorized as having flexible resource demand, so commodity price spikes are not having a particularly big effect on demand.
It is time to put the brakes on this runaway train before it is too late.
Still others (China and Korea) exploited seemingly limitless globalization and buoyant international trade to capture growing market shares.
Facing immediate credit rationing and large output contractions, they could be stabilized only by exceptional official financing from abroad, and, in some extreme cases, by defaulting on past commitments (including to bondholders and, most recently, bank depositors).
With the political context undermining the right mix of short- and longer-term measures, national policymaking has stumbled into partial approaches and unusual experimentation.
As this requires some fundamental domestic re-alignments, the rebalancing will be both gradual and non-linear at times.
The Worst of All Worlds
But it is simply not correct that climate data are systematically worse than expected; in many respects, they are spot on, or even better than expected.
Likewise, and arguably much more importantly, the heat content of the world’s oceans has been dropping for the past four years where we have measurements.
But most models find results within the IPCC range of a sea-level increase of 18 to 59 centimeters (7-23 inches) this century.
That conclusion did not get much exposure in the media.
Even Greece, despite its rapidly eroding competitiveness and increasingly unsustainable fiscal path, could attract the capital that it needed.
But austerity is not working; indeed, it is counterproductive.
Structural reforms are also necessary in most European economies to bolster competitiveness and boost potential growth.
But a shift toward policies to promote growth, supported by the easing of deficit targets and the issuance of Eurobonds, is essential to bring Europe back from the brink of sustained recession, to stabilize Europe’s financial markets, and to prevent another significant disruption to global capital markets.
Nothing.
The rationale has nothing to do with an ethical foreign policy or with German and European interests.
It looks as if Merkel’s government today has adopted the position of Germany’s Greens back then!
Unfortunately, you can forget about that.
The yen’s rising value raises the yield on Japanese bonds relative to the yield on bonds denominated in other currencies.
A direct effect of the higher interest rate would be to increase the budget deficit and the rate of growth of government debt.
The excess of saving over investment has given Japan a current-account surplus, allowing the country to finance all of the government borrowing domestically, with enough left over to invest in dollar-denominated bonds and other foreign securities.
Abe is right about one thing: Japan needs to get out of its no-growth and deflationary trap.
But time to search for loopholes is limited.
By contrast, refusing to comply with the ruling would likely inhibit BNY Mellon from executing the payments, making it virtually impossible to pay the warrant to exchange bondholders on time.
Unless Argentina puts forward an alternative payment proposal, the US Court of Appeals (and, possibly, the US Supreme Court) will have to choose between the holdouts’ “all” and Argentina’s “nothing.”
Britain and France could have stopped Germany.
Out of the ashes of war a new kind of Europe arose, as did a new kind of Japan, which even had a pacifist constitution (written by idealistic Americans, but gratefully accepted by most Japanese).
There is little doubt that the US, like all great powers, has embarked on foolish wars and acted like a bully, especially toward nations in its own hemisphere.
During the Cold War, this was not a serious dilemma.
The second will be expensive and risky.
Citizens associate the EU with, above all, bureaucratic grayness and technocratic rationality.
Electors chose only a representative for the House of Commons, and the majority party then appointed the prime minister.
Instead, politics was usually recast in terms of old inter-group or inter-ethnic tensions.
Each ideological grouping would most likely become factionalized along complex national lines – divisions likely to be reflected in the ensuing competition to be charismatic.
The Wrong Tax for Europe
A return to pre-2007 levels of macroeconomic and financial stability would support growth.
Worse still, over the long run, the tax burden would shift.
On the other hand, Latin America’s long-term growth record is hardly an advertisement for the approach, and accounting for lost tax revenues due to lower GDP would surely yield a less impressive fiscal outcome.
There is, in short, ample reason to be angry at financiers, and real change is needed in how they operate.
When poor countries consume as much per capita as rich countries, will there be enough oil to go around?
Two-thirds of proven reserves are in the Persian Gulf, one of the world’s most volatile regions.
Iran has threatened to cut oil exports if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against it for violating its nuclear pledges.
In the meantime, China’s mercantilist misunderstanding of markets means that it often overpays for what it mistakenly thinks is energy security.
The Olympic Games – no doubt perfectly organized, without a protester, homeless person, religious dissenter, or any other kind of spoilsport in sight – will probably bolster China’s global prestige.
Contrary to what some pundits say, Chinese capitalism is not like nineteenth-century European capitalism.
It may be a Faustian bargain – prosperity in exchange for political obedience – but so far it has worked.
No economy keeps growing at the same pace forever.
It might be a distant dream, but dreaming is what New Year’s is all about.
Brazil has stated that it intends to vote in the Security Council in favor of recommending Palestine’s admission to the General Assembly; Colombia has said that it plans to abstain.
And now, on the European and American attempt to impose UN-mandated sanctions on Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, the BRICS have gone from bad to worse.
With Ireland’s troubles threatening to spill over to Portugal, Spain, and even Italy, it is time to rethink the viability of Europe’s currency union.
State governments in turn have no legal power to abrogate debt contracts vis-à-vis out-of-state creditors, and no incentive to do so (given the help they get from the federal government).
It should have been expected that the political side of the equation would take time to fall into place.
It is hard to see how they can achieve both aims while remaining in the eurozone.
Countries can rejoin, and do so credibly, when the fiscal, regulatory, and political prerequisites are in place.
The Roman Catholic Church has not moved away from its opposition to IVF.
If that is the argument, however, why should we single out couples who use IVF? Why not, for example, criticize Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, the Arkansas couple who recently had their 18th child?
Some will find it grotesque to become a mother at an age when most women are grandmothers, but the more significant question is what kind of care such children will have if their parents die or become incapable of rearing them.
In doing so, officials are reluctant to take into account that the recent crisis resulted from an unprecedented credit boom gone bust.
But the US also has depressed areas.
On balance, it thus seems that this time – or, rather, this post-crisis environment – really is different, and that macroeconomic policies have done little to improve matters.
The protests began when the government tried to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned the conviction of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra – Yingluck’s brother and the PTP’s founder, who was overthrown by the military in 2006 – on charges of corruption and abuse of power. (It also would have superseded the murder charges brought against the Democratic Party’s leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.)
Making matters worse, voters on both sides are tuning in only to views with which they agree, rather than attempting to understand and reconcile opposing arguments.
Thailand’s experience suggests that efforts to subvert the system by thwarting the will of the majority may ultimately be fruitless, though not before imposing extremely high costs on everyone.
According to OECD estimates, the relative export performance of high-cost Germany increased by 10% from 2005 to 2013, while US exports grew only 1.2% faster than demand in the rest of the world.
And, even in these sectors, competitiveness must be defined in a much broader sense than that given simply by comparing cost statistics.
This is because greater reliance on recycling, for example, reduces costs – and thus enhances companies’ competitiveness – while reducing emissions and driving new approaches like cross-sector innovation.
BERLIN/BUDAPEST – In April, when German Chancellor Angel Merkel congratulated Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on his reelection, she let it be known that his large majority implied a “special responsibility” to use good judgment and behave with sensitivity toward opponents.
One might expect European conservatives, in particular, to react strongly to Orbán’s actions, which discredit their entire political movement.
These should include, first and foremost, the exclusion of Fidesz from the EPP faction in the European Parliament, to be readmitted only if and when Orbán changes course.
Fortunately, the EU and its members are far from powerless to prevent such an outcome.
This tendency at times of economic downturn suggests that SWFs are not the long-term, stable shareholders of foreign firms that they (and some commentators) claim themselves to be.
First, we have seen multiple examples of domestic investments by SWFs clearly aimed at sustaining and stabilizing domestic economies.
In times of crisis, SWFs not only invest a smaller proportion of their portfolios abroad and divest from some foreign holdings, but the total value of their investments tends to shrink as well.
At the same time, the expected benefits of having SWFs as shareholders – that is, of having a long, stable investor – might simply be a mirage, which disappears precisely when that stability is most needed: during a global financial crisis.
The outcome of two related policy battles will be key to the economic and political outlook in both the US and Europe.
But President Barack Obama and his congressional allies have rejected the consensus that government should be only a last resort for those in need, in favor of greater dependence, for both individuals and firms, on entitlement programs and other public spending, targeted tax breaks, regulations, and loans.
But those now demanding further deficit-financed stimulus must confront considerable evidence that an overhang of public debt impedes growth for a long time.
Canada, in the past two decades, has decreased spending by 8% of GDP and similarly prospered.
This is the rule set out by Walter Bagehot more than a century ago: calming the markets requires central banks to lend at a penalty rate to every distressed institution that would be able to put up reasonable collateral in normal times.
Of course, easy monetary policy can cause inflation, and the failure to “punish” financial institutions that exercised poor judgment in the past may lead to more of the same in the future.
Yes, the financial system is insolvent, but it has nominal liabilities and either it or its borrowers have some real assets.
CHICAGO – Democratic governments are not incentivized to take decisions that have short-term costs but produce long-term gains, the typical pattern for any investment.
Democracies are necessarily softhearted, whereas markets are not; government action has expanded to fill the gap.
For example, in the United States, public support for President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal was broad-based throughout the 1930’s.
Movements like the Tea Party have thus tended keep in check those who, after a crisis of the sort that America has had, typically want more government action, including curbing markets and competition.
Three Paths to America
The second Latin American position towards the US is embodied in “Chavism.” This stance characterizes populist governments, often sustained mainly by gas and oil, that practice autocratic democracy, ignoring any formal constitutional division of powers and running roughshod over independent institutions and the press.
But nothing guarantees that, even if the Democrats win, they will change America’s foreign policies.
Which Way for US Foreign Policy?
All of them were strong internationalists when compared to the true isolationists of the 1930s, who bitterly opposed coming to the aid of Britain in WWII.
The problem is not guns vs. butter, but guns vs. butter vs. taxes.
Is air power and the training of foreign forces enough? Particularly in the Middle East, where revolutions are likely to last for a generation, a smart combination of hard and soft power will be difficult to achieve.
How much to spend on foreign affairs and how to intervene in distant crises are important questions.
Just as important, however, was President Barack Obama’s reaction to the Colorado and Washington votes – both states that he won easily in his re-election bid.
The third change in recent months occurred in one of the world’s largest drug-supplying countries: Mexico, through which practically all of the illegal drugs shipped to the US – cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamines – must pass.
Uruguay is expected to approve legislation fully legalizing marijuana in January; the Organization of American States is scheduled to deliver a report to the region’s heads of state at mid-year on alternative drug-enforcement strategies and existing “best practices” in other countries.
Financial institutions with liquidity increasingly prefer to deposit their cash with the European Central Bank, which has had to resume its lending to banks.
Eurozone officials’ decision to reform the surveillance of governments and banks, and to boost the European Financial Stability Facility, is a welcome response, but, unfortunately, a partial one.
It has played this role with Italy and Spain, but it has met stiff opposition internally and may capitulate soon.
These responses are, of course, partly complementary.
Saving in China is in part a virtuous circle: rapid economic growth leads to high saving, which in turn sustains rapid growth.
However, the same factors seem to be working in the same direction for saving in the US, too.
For one thing, although the Chinese don’t elect their leaders, they trust their government more.
There is no shame in being poor in China if one reflects that one’s children or grandchildren will be wealthy and successful.
Today’s children will not view their own life stories from the perspective of the difficulties China has experienced.

दरअसल, पिछले 60 सालों में, तिब्बतियों ने प्रतिरोध के आंदोलन का ऐसा मॉडल अपनाया है, जिस पर आतंकवाद के साथ किन्हीं संबद्धताओं का दाग नहीं है। यहाँ तक कि तिब्बत की धार्मिक, सांस्कृतिक, और भाषायी विरासत के प्रति चीन का दमन अधिकाधिक कठोर होने पर भी, तिब्बतियों ने हथियार नहीं उठाए हैं। इसके बजाय, उन्होंने आत्मदाह के माध्यम से विरोध किया है, जो 2009 के बाद से 140 तिब्बतियों ने किया है।
Chua’s thesis is that, when compared to Americans, Chinese children tend to be successful because they have “tiger mothers,” whereas Western mothers are pussycats, or worse.
No matter how hard a tiger mom pushes, not every student can finish first (unless, of course, we make everyone “top of the class”).
Another couple believes in “self-directed learning” to such an extent that one evening they went to bed at 11 p.m., leaving their five-year-old watching her ninth straight hour of Barbie videos.
Tigers lead solitary lives, except for mothers with their cubs.
We are entering a post-American world – the world beyond America’s brief moment of global domination.
The late twentieth century worked so well for Europeans.
So, for most European states, transatlantic relations are primarily about NATO and their bilateral links with the US.
There is no shortage of ideas about how to encourage this through new processes and forums for US-EU strategic dialogue.
Time for America to Turn South
First and foremost is economic growth, which for the past few years - indeed, for the past two decades - has been dismal.
Second, America has a strong security interest in the region.
Last year, I visited the main jumping-off point on the US-Mexican border: El Sasabe on the Sonora-Arizona border.
China is being pressured to halt its interventions to prop up the US dollar in world currency markets, with opponents emphasizing how much harm the policy is causing to other countries.
There is a great deal of volatility in foreign-exchange markets across the globe, mainly owing to the weakening of the dollar.
If exchange rates were fixed but capital could move freely, capital flight from the country would generate pressures to end loose monetary policies.
LONDON – As US and NATO soldiers prepare for their tenth Christmas in Afghanistan, a new buzzword is making the rounds: “transition,” the process of transferring responsibility for security from international to Afghan forces ahead of the withdrawal of foreign troops, which is set to begin in the spring of 2011.
Lack of transparency is driving fears that Hamid Karzai’s government is brokering a power-sharing deal with the Taliban that will do little to foster stability or better governance.
For this reason, perpetrators of serious human-rights violations on all sides should be held accountable, a demand that has been pointedly ignored since 2001.
Fire, bullets, and bayonets were now joined by nuclear radiation – a silent, invisible killer like gas and biological agents.
The aim of the NPT, signed in 1968, is the universal elimination of nuclear weapons: non-nuclear-weapon states commit not to acquire them, and the five states that officially possess them (the US, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia) commit to disarmament negotiations.
Doing so, it was suggested, could lead Russia to remove its own tactical nuclear weapons.
For that reason alone, it should become an international priority.
The Americans are happy that India’s pesky left, reduced to a paltry 24 seats, has been all but eliminated from national government.
That’s exciting news to retailers looking for new markets.
Observers expect the young Gandhi to become prime minister within two years.
His philosophy of non-violence was aimed at the most basic form of human aggression: the appetite for more than one’s share.
“[I]f the US were getting good value from the extra…$750 billion diverted annually from paying people who make directly useful goods and provide directly useful services, it would be obvious in the statistics.”
It seemed to me that, yes, our modern sophisticated financial systems had created enormous macroeconomic risks.
That rather poor cost-benefit ratio does not appear to be improving.
And it carries its own serious risks of moral hazard and the loss of the ECB’s credibility and independence.
In response to this trend, the IMF urges a return to pre-crisis debt-to-GDP ratios.
Will a new Stability and Growth Pact, with eurozone members assessing the fiscal policies of their peers, solve these problems? IMF consultations and evaluations have had little impact outside of economies that are heavily dependent on IMF programs.
Sensible rules promise big payoffs, given the current and long-term global crisis in public finances.
In services, trade barriers stand in the way of improved quality and efficiency, slowing the growth of a sector that could make a huge contribution to competitiveness and employment.
If properly designed, they can benefit their members, especially if combined with reduced trade barriers for all trading partners.
For example, it is untenable in rich countries that farm interests accounting for less than 4% of employment are effectively able to block a deal to open new markets for services and manufactures, which account for more than 90% of employment.
For the sake of their citizens, the global trading system, and the world’s poor, it is time to get back to business.
So, the US banking system is effectively insolvent in the aggregate; most of the British banking system looks insolvent, too, as do many continental European banks.
Indeed, the problem has now grown larger, because the current approach has led weak banks to take over even weaker banks.
The US remains the world’s most powerful state, however, and the senators’ decision will inevitably have an impact beyond their country’s borders.
The cataclysmic potential of such a conflict makes it essential to limit and eventually eliminate this leftover from the Cold War.
Any delay to the treaty, however, will embolden those in Moscow who would rather have the West as an enemy than as a partner – and who thus would like to see the tenuous progress made in recent months to be undone.
For Europeans, the NIE has not removed, but rather confirmed, the concerns that in 2003 prompted the EU-3 (Britain, France, and Germany) – namely, that Iran’s nuclear program could eventually give it a military nuclear capability, and that even before that point, it might trigger regional nuclear proliferation.
Politically, Ahmadinejad certainly would not miss the chance to exploit unilateral measures for propaganda purposes – claiming that Iran has a conflict not with the international community, but with imperialist states intent on depriving his country of technological progress.
Both the EU and the US should be prepared to enter into direct, comprehensive, and unconditional negotiations with Iran. Where security guarantees are concerned, America is Iran’s actual foe and potential partner.
And, so far, we have neither.
The financial sector’s inexcusable recklessness, given free rein by mindless deregulation, was the obvious precipitating factor of the crisis.
Rapid productivity increases in manufacturing had outpaced growth in demand, which meant that manufacturing employment decreased.
Countries recognized that without reserves, they risked losing their economic sovereignty.
And government-financed education and training, in particular, will be critical in restoring competitiveness in Europe and the US.
Indeed, the number of research questions that we can pose is increasing exponentially.
In a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association published in July 2005, I showed that refutation is very common, even for the most prestigious research findings.
Sometimes, this will be the best evidence we have.
But it would be a damaging to expect science to “show off” in this way.
Greece will need to reduce its debt ratio considerably before it can return to the capital markets, which implies – even under an optimistic scenario – creating a primary surplus in excess of eight percentage points of GDP.
Debt reduction is not fatal.
Europe, however, is not obliged to choose between catastrophe and mutualization of debt.
They did agree – barely ­– to hold a low-level experts meeting in early July, but no one expects this to lead to a breakthrough.
There are several sub-texts underlying the current stand-off, superbly analyzed in a report this month from the International Crisis Group.
But those assessments will prove to be naïve unless Iran, at the very least, verifiably suspends any enrichment beyond 5%, renders its 20% stockpile incapable of military application, and meets the concern about Fordow by modifying its role and opening it to intrusive monitoring.
Tobacco use has the potential to undermine economic and social development worldwide.
The report also details the efforts countries are making to meet tobacco-control targets and makes recommendations for improvement.
The tobacco industry and other vested interests argue that tax increases on tobacco products fuel illicit trade.
CAMBRIDGE – European leaders are seriously considering a Tobin tax, which would put a small levy on financial transactions, thereby dampening trading.
While these are worthy goals, there are good reasons to believe that the tax would not achieve most of them.
That left the financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities in much weaker condition, and several failed.
To be sure, markets might move those transactions from France and from French financial institutions, and, if the regulators erred – because the business was profitable and not destabilizing – French institutions would lose out.
Until recently, the government’s response to the epidemic, which threatened the country’s very lifeblood, was lackluster and foolish.
But, during the 1990’s, and for reasons that are still not fully understood, the virus exploded into the general population.
With almost two million patients now on antiretroviral treatment, annual AIDS-related deaths have fallen by around 100,000 since 2005.
It seems appropriate that, due to the Iraq war, the world has been debating the nature of democracy 200 years after Alexis de Tocqueville’s birth.
Neither local democracy nor small societies, neither governmental checks and balances nor civil rights, can prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause.
Do the defects of democracy really mean, as Tocqueville claimed, that resigned pessimism is the only – realistic but unsustainable – path open to us? I don’t think so.
The result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences.
Since the 1960’s, such proscriptions have weakened until, in the end, explicit sexuality, violence, blasphemy – while upsetting to some people – were tolerated as a part of the enlightened world.
One such limit is the incitement to violence.
This means that we have to defend Salman Rushdie and the Danish cartoonists and the friends of Idomeneo , whether we like them or not.
Whether an editor publishes cartoons offensive to believers in Muhammad (or Christ, for that matter) is a matter of judgment, almost of taste.
That ideology is based on a warped and false view of religion.
When I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1997, Nigeria served as an example of productive cooperation between Christians and Muslims.
The Middle East, as we know, is immersed in a process of revolution and upheaval that has been immensely complicated by Islamism and its extremist offshoots.
This Islamist ideology is a spectrum.
So the battle is not lost.
LONDON – In November, I spoke at the United Nations Security Council for the first time in 13 years.
It is a threat that is constantly evolving, growing, and mutating to counter our fight against it.
That is why we need to start thinking of education as a security issue.
There are extremist acts perpetrated against Muslims because of their religion, and today there are fanatical Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists who disfigure the true nature of their faith.
To be sure, we are only a drop in the ocean.
It is up to all of us to show people that we have a better idea than the extremists have – to learn from each other and live with each other.
Britain’s most adept and skillful politician has evidently known for years exactly what not to do about arranging his departure, and yet he has chosen to ignore his own advice.
So there was the topic, inescapably, right in the middle of the room.
Now, with the country insisting on an answer to the question he posed, they see him as a liability.
They may also suggest a slight tendency, on the part of those uttering them, to believe in some kind of supernatural endorsement.
Throughout the long years of this bloody tragedy, we have tried to inch our way to a settlement through confidence-building measures or, in the case of the long dead “Road Map,” through pushing both parties to take parallel steps towards an agreement.
There cannot be a Palestinian state without dealing with West Bank settlements.
That historic triumph depended on bringing in Sinn Fein politicians – leaders of the Irish Republican movement who in many cases could not be distinguished from the IRA, which bombed, shot, and maimed civilians in pursuit of its political goals.
I want to see – and I’m sure Blair does, too – a peaceful Palestinian state next door to a secure Israel in a region united in prosperity and stability.
Yet Blair’s domestic legacy is a mood of disillusion and mistrust, especially of Blair himself.
So why did Blair support it? Part of the answer goes back to Blair’s first big foreign policy adventure, NATO’s intervention in Kosovo in 1999.
Indeed, it is possible that Blair, through his complicity in the Iraq war, has inflicted major damage on the very idea of a “special relationship” between Britain and the United States.
The term “too big to fail” dates back several decades, but it entered wide usage in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
Regulators are instructed, in no uncertain terms, to make sure that all large financial firms are structured in such a way that bankruptcy, using the standard rules and procedures of the court system, can happen without repeating the catastrophic post-Lehman cascade.
Second, it is fanciful to believe that the private sector would want to get involved in providing funding to a huge financial firm under court supervision, particularly during a systemic crisis.
Too Big to Reform?
That is easy to say, but governments, individually and collectively, are still struggling to redefine the terms of that contract.
The British government did the same, acting as midwife to the Lloyds-Halifax Bank of Scotland combine, now widely seen to have been a major error.
It is encouraging, too, that private equity funds look interested in creating and funding new entrants.
Numerous policy options to deal with this problem are now being debated.
And it is possible – indeed, I suspect likely – that such credit-supply problems would exist even if the too-big-to-fail problem were effectively addressed.
To remedy this, we need two kinds of transitions.
Government savings have fallen, especially in the United States and Japan, and household savings have virtually disappeared in some countries with housing booms.
But if the problem is weak investment, then a reduction in such incentives will lead to excessively high real interest rates when the factors holding back investment dissipate.
But the answer is not a low-quality investment binge led by government or fuelled by easy credit; we know the consequences of that.
In that possibility lies the well-being of us all.
Nevertheless, he is telling the truth.
The scandal over Mayor Luzhkov’s incompetence in handling this summer’s deadly heat wave and wild fires is being portrayed as a split between the “modernizing” Medvedev and the “old guard” Putin.
Since Putin did not formally take sides over what would happen to Luzhkov, had Medvedev’s campaign against Moscow’s former mayor failed, the president would have found himself without a job in 2012.
Beyond the opposition, numerous non-political public initiatives have sprung up in the last several years to protest specific government policies – leading inevitably to confrontation with the existing political order.
The answer is most likely both and neither.
Beyond this, we were taught that we could "apply pressure."
The hidden rules of the game came closest to being officially acknowledged during two uninterrupted weeks of simulated interrogations towards the end of the training course.
We never studied them, nor were we given a copy to read, much less tested on their contents.
Now that Europe’s current crisis has convinced many that existing institutional arrangements are unsustainable, this may be about to change.
But the euro is no longer a strong common currency that reinforces a shared European identity.
Although the Stability and Growth Pact has lost more and more respect (indeed, it is now to be applied, according to the European Commission, purely according to national leaders’ discretion), it would remain the anchor for fiscal stability and confidence.
Attempting to compel transfer payments would generate moral hazard on the part of the recipients and resistance from the donors, with the resulting increase in tensions possibly jeopardizing the integration that has been achieved so far.
It is difficult to see the stationing of 2,500 US Marines in Darwin, Australia – a decision announced by US President Barack Obama on his recent tour of Asia – as anything more than a symbolic gesture, a provocative reminder that the US is determined to stay in the region.
Under current conditions, responding to China’s rise with military force would be unwelcome.
An alliance between the US, Japan, Australia, and possibly India designed to contain China would be greeted by the Chinese with that history firmly in mind.
Of course, diplomacy needs to be backed by strength, but the US has plenty without militarizing the Asia-Pacific region more than it already has.
Asia today presents a completely new and unique set of circumstances.
De Gaulle’s constitution has also proved flexible enough to allow France to overcome several crises – Algeria, May 1968, de Gaulle’s resignation, changes of government from right to left, and antagonism between left-wing presidents and right-wing prime ministers or vice-versa (“la cohabitation”), as occurred in 1986, 1993, and 1997.
Others support moving toward a pure parliamentary regime in the manner of the United Kingdom.
To strengthen this new institutional balance, Sarkozy is considering providing the opposition with a formal status, thus turning it into a real alternative power, and he wants to review the constitution’s Article 16, which gives excessive power to the president in times of crisis.
It needs to become a political initiative.
Foreign ministries translated that idea into the Stability Pact, but finance ministers refused to finance it, so the pact remained an empty shell.
The European Commission is already engaged in preparing such plans. They need to be given greater substance.
They do on a small scale what the Wider European Initiative ought to do on a large scale: promote democratic development by supporting civil society while working with governments when possible.
Belarus seems beyond redemption, but appearances are deceptive.
By the decade’s end, China’s economy will be larger than Germany’s.
This gives us considerable standing.
Environmental degradation in Asia not only harms its population’s health, but will become an impediment to growth.
ASEAN is working with its partners to tackle global issues such as security, energy, and climate change, and its plans for a charter on enhanced cooperation is an encouraging first step toward creating a political architecture.
Europe must take Asian views on global governance seriously.
In this progressive transformation of the international system, German and European foreign policy will play an active role.
But, if the results of such tests are to be reliable, they should avoid the US tests’ fundamental flaw.
Rather than estimate the economic value of banks’ assets – what the assets would fetch in a well-functioning market – and the extent to which they exceed liabilities, the stress tests merely sought to verify that the banks’ accounting losses over the next two years will not exhaust their capital as recorded in their books.
Either way, the true value of banks’ toxic assets must be estimated before concluding that banks are armed with sufficient capital to carry out their critical roles.
Yet pressure to democratize is mounting, in part due to the smaller Gulf States, which compete with each other in democratic reforms.
Low turnout, by contrast, could convince western audiences that, despite the Saudi state’s best efforts to jump-start democracy, its people are satisfied with the status quo.
Indeed, the “King Abdul-Aziz Center for National Dialogue” is utterly divorced from domestic realities and serves as a mere propaganda center whose participants believe that they form part of the state’s message to the outside world.
Despite cynicism, apathy, frustration, despair, and violence, some Saudis still hope for the emergence of a prince on a white horse who will place the kingdom onto the path of reform.
But the politics of trade liberalization – that is, the way in which countries proceed to accept free trade – is much more complex, largely because of those particular groups it hurts.
After all, existing tariff levels on manufactured goods are already much lower than those on agriculture or dairy products.
As the economist Jagdish Bhagwati points out, maintaining increased protections for, say, intellectual property may encourage research and innovation.
Failure to ratify the TPP in all 12 countries would be a major disappointment, not just because of the tremendous amount of effort that has gone into it, but also – and more important – because of the vast economic benefits it would bring to all countries involved.
And then it became a convoy, as Malaysia, Mexico, Canada, and finally – in 2013 – Japan joined the negotiations.
South Korea is warming to the idea of the TPP, as is Indonesia, following President Joko Widodo’s recent visit to Washington, DC.
Japan’s ranchers do need time to adjust.
So why not protect our landscape as a resource for tourism – and even as a way of combating climate change?
But at this stage, the TPP is different: the odds of success would be much greater if the US attached the additional requirement that participating countries do not engage in currency manipulation.
Similarly, the US Treasury is legally required to determine if a country is intervening to an unfair and unreasonable extent.
Participating countries could allow their currencies to float, or they could operate a fixed exchange rate.
The fast-track measure, officially known as Trade Promotion Authority, passed only because Obama was able to rely on rare backing from the Republican majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
In 2007, by contrast, 109 House Democrats voted in favor of the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, precisely because its terms had been adjusted as requested and in line with the May agreement.
And the May 2007 agreement makes it clear that “foreign investors in the US will not be accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than US investors in the US.”
Yes, the logic of market-based global commerce is very strong.
Regrettably, the United States is insisting on a series of intellectual-property provisions that serve the interests of US-based firms, but do little to create a sound environment for innovation elsewhere.
A firm in Thailand, the Philippines, or Vietnam can develop a new product line by plugging into the huge East Asian value chain and producing, for example, a tiny component which, along with myriad other components, will be assembled into a smartphone at a factory in China.
The US is pushing for longer copyright protection for published works, music, and films.
But most economists agree that such incentives must be balanced against the need to accelerate knowledge dissemination and absorption, and that the optimum is somewhere in the middle.
The US itself would benefit from having trade partners that can innovate, instead of serving only as passive buyers for American movies and songs.
Additional gains from trade include increased variety and the economies of scale implied by producing for global markets.
Through a succession of lengthy and difficult global negotiations – the so-called “GATT rounds” – tariffs were steadily lowered for an increasing variety of goods.
This can occur in a number of ways, such as the erection of non-tariff barriers that favor domestic incumbents at the expense of lower-priced potential imports that would benefit consumers.
WASHINGTON, DC – It is impossible to deny that trade and exchange rates are closely linked.
The most direct method is purchases of foreign assets.
Meanwhile, most other eurozone countries have lately been forced to tighten fiscal policy, thereby reducing or eliminating their current-account deficits.
The G-20 “mutual assessment process” – established to analyze national economic policies’ effects on other countries and on global growth, with the goal of formulating individual adjustment commitments – has highlighted the difficulty of reaching agreement on macroeconomic policies with significant spillover effects.
But aid is no panacea.
Trade is also an engine of political and economic reform.
What is needed, therefore, is a pledge by governments to make global trade liberalization a much higher political priority.
CAMBRIDGE – US President Barack Obama is still pressing to obtain Trade Promotion Authority and use it to conclude negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union. But many in the US Congress insist that provisions must be added to the agreements to prevent currency manipulation.
The People’s Bank of China, for example, bought a record quantity of dollars from 2004 to 2014, thereby preventing the renminbi’s exchange rate from appreciating as fast as it otherwise would have done.
Some have argued that even though the PBOC has stopped buying US and other foreign assets, China’s sovereign wealth funds still do, and that this, too, counts as manipulation.
NEW YORK – The massacre in Norway in July 2011 and the recent attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, were the work of right-wing extremists who sought to remake the world in their neo-Nazi image.
Many in the US feared that, just as the nineteenth century had been British and the twentieth century had been American, the twenty-first century would be Japanese.
Similarly, Senator Charles Schumer of New York has indulged in Japan-bashing, China-bashing, and India-bashing – a singular record of truculence and economic illiteracy – while Senator Barbara Boxer of California attacked her most recent electoral opponent, Carly Fiorina, for eliminating 30,000 jobs at Hewlett Packard during her stewardship of the company.
Unfortunately, it has gotten a much lower standard than it anticipated.
The irony is that trade has collapsed just when these countries were becoming increasingly active in global markets, with their exports rising by more than 20% during this decade.
Trade increases competition and keeps inflation in check.
Despite the economic crisis, Aid for Trade donor contributions to help the less fortunate have risen 10% per year since 2005, and major donors are on track to meet or exceed their pledges for future funds.
The next Ministerial Conference ought to signal that we are ready to do so.
Our second message was optimistic: if the agenda of the current round is reoriented towards development, and if assistance is provided to manage implementation and adjustment costs, developing countries can gain much.
These were off the agenda in earlier trade rounds, as the US pushed for liberalization of financial services - thus serving its own comparative advantage.
Are developing countries really targeting this area in the next few years? Clearly, this issue is not high on their agenda.
The breakdown of the Cancun talks may yet provide an opportunity for deeper reflection.
She has written a manifesto about breaking the glass ceiling, called Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, and is drawing fire for it, because she argues that women often sabotage themselves.
So the opportunity to learn and practice speaking and negotiating skills is hardly inconsequential for women’s advancement.
The all-female peer group’s emphasis on supporting women to be strong and achieve their goals is critical, as two young leaders, Courtney Martin and Katie Orenstein (both Woodhull Institute alumnae) recently noted.
NEW YORK – As negotiators and ministers from the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries meet in Atlanta in an effort to finalize the details of the sweeping new Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), some sober analysis is warranted.
For starters, consider what the agreement would do to expand intellectual property rights for big pharmaceutical companies, as we learned from leaked versions of the negotiating text.
International corporate interests tout ISDS as necessary to protect property rights where the rule of law and credible courts are lacking.
Rather than shutting down manufacturers and forcing them to compensate those who had been harmed, under ISDS, governments would have had to pay the manufacturers not to kill their citizens.
(Members of Congress may read the technical text, under restricted conditions, but are not allowed to describe its contents in detail.)
Encouraging exports to these countries is surely desirable, but the economic impact on the US is unlikely to be more than a rounding error.
In Vietnam, moving large subsidies provided to state-owned enterprises onto a measurable, market basis would be a sensible goal.
As Levin recently argued in a detailed and persuasive speech, the US should be having a full and open debate about these dimensions of the TPP deal.
The drift in transatlantic relations during the eight years of George W. Bush’s presidency was meant to be stopped – and even reversed.
America fears deflation; Europe – driven by its largest economy, Germany – fears national debt and inflation.
Brown has few options left, and the UK is nowhere near the worst of the crisis.
This kind of legitimate and yet petty-minded thinking has serious international consequences.
If Europe sees its role in this crisis – which might yet turn into a full-blown depression – as that of a free-rider, it will be treated accordingly in the future.
Such actions undermine the slow renovation of transatlantic trust since Edward Snowden’s revelations concerning the extent of American surveillance of European governments and citizens alike.
Fortunately, solutions that satisfy the need for national security and demands for privacy are not out of reach.
That is why building transatlantic trust and cooperation is so important, and why America’s refusal to turn words into legal guarantees is likely to be self-defeating.
The Growth and Stability Pact would safeguard fiscal discipline.
But the International Monetary Fund and the United States rejected the idea.
The depreciation that followed the crisis helped accelerate recovery by boosting exports.
Europeans now have a regional monetary fund, which Asians wanted but could not have.
Although science has demonstrated that CO2 from fossil fuels is heating the planet, politicians are unwilling to follow his advice and stop building coal-fired power plants.
There is clearly a trend.
CO2 emissions result from other, generally beneficial acts, such as burning coal to keep warm, burning kerosene to cook, or burning gas to transport people.
Is it really treason against the planet to express some skepticism about whether this is the right way forward?
Earlier that day, the prince had the bomber flown in on his private jet from the Yemeni-Saudi border and reportedly ordered that he not be carefully searched.
For example, he offers significant financial inducements to individual jihadis, as well as their families, in return for political obedience.
Suicide bombings of public buildings and attacks on oil and other government installations have alienated many Saudis.
The annual World Economic Forum is rightly perceived as a global “barometer.”
Of course, the danger of Davos lies in this concentrated commingling of the chattering classes and the real world of politics and business.
The return of the state, even when it is the power of the European Commission to sanction Microsoft, is on everyone’s lips.
Traditional growth theories focus on systematic forces – for example, capital accumulation, employment, and technical change – that, by definition, operate all the time, although with varying degrees of intensity.
First, because financial crises as deep as the latest one are socially so costly, it is only natural to try to prevent them.
There are no policies that could suspend the operation of all these linkages without damaging longer-term growth.
Given the fiscal legacy of the current crisis, no efforts should be spared in anchoring fiscal discipline firmly in European Union countries.
ISLAMABAD – Sitting next to a four-foot-tall water pipe, I asked the tribal leader in front of me: What does victory mean to you? He sputtered smoke, raised his bushy white eyebrows, and said, “Victory.
America sends in missiles and air strikes that infuriate the people rather than aid and emissaries to engage them.
With five years of Iraqi experience – and powerful communication and financial support behind them – this network is growing rapidly.
And the international community is absent as well.
SRSP has the capacity; they just need direction and financial support in order to expand.
“Libertarian paternalists” like Sunstein and Thaler claim that we have two different ways of making decisions: one “from the gut” (called System I), and the other more deliberative and far more effective (called System II).
With a neat twist of logic, our cognitive imperfections are turned on their heads, and made to work to achieve System-II choices.
The benefits of tax evasion may far outweigh the risk of getting caught, but imagine if everyone decided to evade taxes at the same time.
The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices.
Japan’s new activism also was widely imitated. South Korea and then Brazil started similar action to drive down their currency.
But the report gave no guidance about how to judge whether exchange rates were appropriate or not.
As debate about Japanese economic decline intensified, a consensus emerged in Japan that outside pressure had forced the country into adopting a dangerous and ultimately destructive course.
The debate about China’s artificially pegged exchange rate has led Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to begin to believe that they, too, might try shaping exchange rates.
Harper’s tough talk on Russia’s annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine, and on China’s disturbing human-rights record won him wide public support.
And closer integration with Canada’s vast energy resources could provide Europe with an attractive alternative to its heavy reliance on imports from Russia and the Middle East.
Trudeau, by contrast, has vowed to be a very different type of leader, promising to pursue an inclusive approach to policymaking and to allow his ministers to take much greater responsibility for their portfolios.
And yet now we must ask whether the US current-account deficit is still a problem.
I propose a third, more speculative reason why it may be time to stop worrying about the US current-account deficit.
Everyone knows that errors and omissions are large, especially when it comes to financial transactions.
But part of the discrepancy also reflects the discovery of missing assets, some of which may have originated in the reinvestment of overseas income.
Admittedly, the country’s dire economic condition and its urgent need for energy made the agreement venal in a way.
Success would be guaranteed if the international community, especially the United States, clearly understands and admits its necessity, and supports it firmly and completely.
Nor has the Iranian government ever publicly expressed a will to possess nuclear weapons.
If we interpret the NPT correctly, we can launch negotiations with Iran that would carefully explore the potential sincerity or not of its official stance.
But Tsipras squandered Greece’s opportunity, because he and other Syriza leaders were unable to see beyond the horizon of their party’s origins in radical opposition activism.
I hope that they do not share policy priorities, particularly a change of strategic alliances, which would be equally bad for Greece and for Europe.
The Greek crisis cannot be used either to weaken European conservatives and change the balance of power within the EU, or to remove the Greek left from office.
Penurunan jumlah pemilih yang anjlok dalam waktu kurang dari dua bulan menggambarkan perubahan suasana hati pemilih secara drastis – dari penuh semangat menjadi murung.
Mulai tahun depan, setiap pengusaha diharuskan membayar 26% turnover tax dari setiap euro yang dihasilkan – sembari diwajibkan membayar pajak di muka pada tahun 2016 nanti yang besarnya adalah 75% dari jumlah pajak mereka tahun 2017.
Sayangnya, meskipun potong rambut ini diperlukan, sekarang sudah terlambat, hanya sedikit, dan terlalu berbahaya sehubungan dengan parameter keuangan dan hukum mereka.
Gagasan ini bertujuan untuk menunjukkan kepada pemilih bahwa pemerintah dapat menggabungkan kapitulasi pada troika dengan agenda reformasinya sendiri, terdiri atas peningkatan efisiensi dan serangan terhadap oligarki yang dapat membebaskan dana dengan tujuan mengurangi dampak austerity terhadap Yunani yang melemah.
That needs to change – especially as we learn more about the interaction between TB and another deadly global killer: diabetes.
Two decades ago, TB and HIV/AIDS were paired in a similar deadly interplay.
That event, hosted by the Indonesian Ministry of Health, drew experts from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.
In other words, the diseases that cause nine-tenths of what the World Health Organization refers to as “the global burden of disease” are getting only one-tenth of the world’s medical research effort.
At a meeting in Oslo in August, Incentives for Global Health, a nonprofit organization directed by Aidan Hollis, professor of economics at the University of Calgary, and Thomas Pogge, professor of philosophy and international affairs at Yale, launched a radical new proposal to change the incentives under which corporations are rewarded for developing new medicines.  They suggest that governments contribute to a Health Impact Fund that would pay pharmaceutical companies in proportion to the extent to which their products reduce the global burden of disease.
Hollis and Pogge estimate that about $6 billion a year would be required to enable the Fund to provide a sufficient incentive for drug companies to register products that target the diseases of the poor.
Given concerns about security and the fate of the democratic transition, economic issues were essentially put on hold in both elections. Now it is time for Tunisia’s leaders to put the economy at the top of their agenda.
There is already broad agreement among the major political parties on the necessary priorities: bringing public spending under control, encouraging private-sector growth and employment, promoting regional development and social inclusion, and investing in essential infrastructure.
The incoming funds, and the subsequent growth and job creation, would undergird the consolidation of democracy – and thus help cement the impressive gains that Tunisia has made so far.
They later found themselves on the losing end of a long history of violence between their own separatist forces and the Turkish army, as well as being subjected to an ongoing policy of discrimination and forced assimilation.
There are also understandable fears that diverging from the official line would trigger a flood of compensation claims, as occurred against Germany.
This is not healthy for the development of Armenia’s democracy and weak economy.
Turkey’s bureaucrats, politicians, and citizens united to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership and tolerated the pain of the IMF-directed structural-adjustment programs.
They consider a European Turkey an opportunity to develop their own relations with the EU.
Turkey’s constructive engagement with the EU creates a sense of trust in the West – among Western leaders at least, if not yet the general population -- for its regional initiatives.
At the start of the new decade, too, Turkey’s geopolitical position, rich historical heritage, cultural depth, well-educated young population, ever-strengthening democracy, growing economy, and constructive foreign policy make it an indispensable country in a world transformed by rapid globalization.
There are few countries that can play such a critical role.
History clearly shows that it is impossible to establish and sustain global peace without ensuring peace and stability in the Balkans and the Middle East.
Therefore, we urge Israel and all other countries involved to follow constructive and peaceful policies.
Turkey’s ever-increasing soft power is becoming one of its most significant traits, which we will continue to use to enhance regional and global peace.
Committed to regime change in Syria, Turkey turned a blind eye to some of these groups’ brutal tactics, radical ideologies, and big ambitions.
To this end, the US and its allies should consider striking Assad’s strongholds in Syria, while establishing safe havens for the moderate opposition under the protective cloak of a no-fly zone.
This means, first and foremost, adopting a zero-tolerance policy toward the Islamic State at home, aimed at preventing the group from fundraising and recruiting on Turkish soil.
In any serious variation of this Grand Strategy, Turkey will need to play a central role – politically, militarily, economically, and culturally.
The key dispute is over Cyprus.
But this attitude is irresponsible.
The final result of the accession process is therefore an open question for both sides.
Indeed, the Arab Spring strengthens rather than weakens Turkey’s position in the Arab world, and vindicates the new strategic thrust of Turkish foreign policy.
Arab intellectuals, activists, and youth leaders of different political inclinations have taken a keen interest in what some describe as the “Turkish model.”
Simply put, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the Nahda Movement in Tunisia, and Hamas in Palestine will all play important and legitimate roles in the political future of their respective countries.
Yesterday, there were flurries of snow in Istanbul. But today the sun glints across the water to the Asian coastline of the city; the seagulls bank in the breeze; a great liner sails majestically north towards the Black Sea.
And we dragged others into our struggles.
It worked far better than the doubters ever imagined was possible – indeed, perhaps even better than its progenitors expected.
Europe with Turkey as a member would naturally be a more dynamic economy.
TEL AVIV – As the Islamic State militant group has advanced across Iraq and Syria, traditional regional alliances, long shaped by Western powers, have been upended.
A couple of weeks later, Erdoğan himself unleashed a furious anti-Western diatribe at Istanbul’s Marmara University. In his speech,&nbsp;he compared the West’s interference in the Middle East today with the British officer Lawrence of Arabia’s involvement in the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans during World War I, and blasted the&nbsp;Sykes-Picot Agreement, which has since defined the Middle East’s political map.
Together, these groups have emerged as the most effective force in the war against the Islamic State.
Erdoğan now finds himself in a strategic quagmire.
The defendants had been given long prison sentences after the first trial concluded in September 2012, even though the evidence against them was clearly forged.
The Gülen movement – made up of the followers of the Pennsylvania-based Turkish imam Fethullah Gülen – did the heavy political lifting. The Gülen movement oversaw Sledgehammer and similar trials via its followers in the police and the judiciary, and used its extensive media outlets to craft and disseminate the narrative – built from countless stories of military plots and other malfeasance – on which these cases rested.
The Erdoğan government adopted legislation that lent credence to its false narrative.
Under intense attack by pro-government media, the general staff failed to mount even the slightest public effort on the accused officers’ behalf, even refusing to release an internal report that left no doubt that the defendants had been framed.
The Case for Turkey in Europe
Turkey has also been diligent in its efforts to consolidate its democracy through the expansion of civil rights and liberties.
Instead, they are facing a variety of criminal charges, including murder with a firearm, bank robbery, and the bombing of police stations.
In a region of predominantly Muslim countries, Turkey has proved itself to be the only one that can maintain and strengthen genuine democracy.
MADRID ‒ June’s Turkish general election sent a powerful message: Turkey’s democracy remains intact.
The direction of change will have to account for the various parties’ preferred approaches.
The escalation of warfare and sectarian violence, which are becoming chronic, endanger both Turkey and Europe.
European leaders should also carefully monitor the possible revision of Turkish foreign policy, grasping opportunities to reignite bilateral dialogue on issues of common interest.
Shortly after that decision, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reversed her previous opposition to Turkish membership in the EU, calling it an “open-ended issue” during a visit to Istanbul.
With the world now more determined than ever to defeat the Islamic State – an enterprise that will, it is becoming clear, require boots on the ground – the major powers are seeking immediately available forces.
Neither side can afford further complication of the already volatile situation.
In the wake of Turkey’s fraying relations with Russia, the decision to proceed with the planned EU-Turkey Summit is an important one.
The massacre of civilians (including many children) in Gaza last summer, the barbarity of ISIS, the murder of rabbis at a Jerusalem synagogue, and the terrorist attack in Ottawa last October – all convey a simple truth: violence is contagious.
The establishment of a more inclusive Iraqi government – enabled by the common sense and coordinated efforts of actors within and outside of the country – is also a positive sign, as are steps toward resolving disagreements between the Kurdistan Regional Government and the central authorities in Baghdad.
It is in everybody’s interest that Israel’s government acts with restraint regarding West Bank settlement and the status of Jerusalem and its holy sites.
The alternative may be too grim for even a pessimist to imagine.
Still, Turkey is in negotiations with a Franco-Japanese consortium for the construction of a second nuclear power plant on the Black Sea.
Indeed, the US has based nuclear weapons in Turkey for decades.
In these circumstances, it matters how the rest of the world portrays and talks about Turkey’s nuclear future.
But this did not happen as Atatürk planned.
Indeed, even Erdoğan, evidently trying to stop the MHP’s advance, used campaign rhetoric that alienated many Kurdish voters.
The third peace process in play concerns Turkey’s relationship with Armenia, which, if improved, could help create the conditions for a peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
So Turkey’s new administration should be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue, together with the United States and Iran, on possible solutions.
Many American policymakers and publicists, unable or unwilling to distinguish Turkish-Israeli relations from Turkish-American relations, interpreted Erdoğan’s condemnation of Israel’s blockade of Gaza as a bid to cozy up to his Arab neighbors at the expense of Turkey’s relations with not only Israel but with the West in general.
First, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) could not afford to be seen as opposing democracy in Syria, given that its own legitimacy rests heavily on its democratic credentials.
Finally, Turkey has invested far too much in its strategic relations with NATO, and with the US in particular, to fritter them away in exchange for uncertain gains in relations with Iran.
What makes the result so complex is that the ruling AKP got far more votes – up 13 percentage points from 2002 – but fewer seats than it had before.
A key factor was the increasing prominence and power of more traditional sections of the population from central Anatolia, where many small businesses grew big, enriching a more Islamic-oriented middle class.
The fact that two-thirds of the voters supported parties that were long considered extremist and whose allegiance to democracy is questionable has shocked many Turks, including those who comprised most of the ruling elite in modern times.
The president names the head of the armed forces, a power that could potentially turn the military into a servant of the government.
“Sledgehammer” is, sad to say, yet another alleged coup plot in a series of attempts to topple the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which was first elected in 2002.
General Yasar Buyukanit, the top commander of the Turkish Armed Forces back then, recently admitted that he himself wrote the April 27 memorandum.
If none of the above constitutes a breach of democratic principles, one wonders what would.
CAMBRIDGE – When questioned recently about a constitutional law professor who was arrested for lecturing at an institute run by the country’s main pro-Kurdish political party, Turkey’s interior minister, Idris Naim Sahin, couldn’t hide his irritation: “I am having a hard time understanding those saying a professor should not be arrested while thousands of other people are being arrested in Turkey.”
Previously autonomous regulatory bodies (such as the competition authority) have been quietly subordinated to the government, with no debate or discussion. 
The Gülenist media now set the country’s new ideological tone, producing a steady stream of disinformation in their vocal support of the country’s show trials.
For Turkey’s friends abroad, it is time for some tough love.
JERUSALEM – A few months before he became Turkey’s foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s chief adviser, met with a group of Middle Eastern academics and policy experts, including Arabs and Israelis.
This, he explained, was the reason that Turkey was trying to find an accommodation with Armenia.
Opposing new sanctions against Iran in the Security Council further alienated Turkey from both the EU and the US.
This is the exact opposite of a genuine “zero conflict” policy that aims to minimize tensions and enhance stability.
The region’s people are sliding into enemy camps, deepening their societies’ wounds in the process.
Second, there is an underlying historical tension between the large Sunni majority and the Alevi-Bektashi minority, loosely linked to Shia Islam.
Respect for diversity and individual freedom, and concern for generating growth and jobs in an atmosphere of social peace, must be guiding principles.
This kind of concern for the rights of all is a hallmark of Turkey’s young generation.
Domestic support for EU accession was 70% at the start of the negotiations, but is now closer to 40%.
Turkey was able not only to defuse the international tensions surrounding its Arab neighbor, but also to engineer the start of direct talks between Syria and Israel.
First, the rise of an Arab political class that is more influenced by religion than by secular nationalism has eroded the main structural barrier to Turkish engagement.
In that case, Turkey’s membership would not, as European federalists argue, lead to a weaker Europe.
As a result, in less than a decade, GDP has tripled, making Turkey the world’s 16th largest economy.
For example, we have quadrupled our trade volume just with our neighbors.
Every day, scores of people there die in pursuit of dignity.
Let us be clear: there is no military solution to this problem.
Turkey’s New Mission
Europe’s persistence in snubbing Turkey’s attempts to join the European Union, the rise of violent anti-Western popular sentiment in the wake of the Iraq war, and strained relations with the US – owing in part to the forthcoming Armenian Genocide Act – are major factors in Turkey’s change of direction.
The “Alliance of the Periphery” was a creative attempt to escape the consequences of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Surveying the regional scene, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has conceived of an audacious plan to enhance Turkey’s regional standing and extend his own political dominance at home.
A recently leaked account of Ocalan’s strategy highlights the risk, for it cites the PKK leader as threatening the government with full-scale war.
Under Iraq’s constitution, the Kurdish region is entitled to 17% of the country’s oil and gas revenues.
Turkey’s Rise and the Decline of Pan-Arabism
In Erdogan’s vision, modernization does not preclude a return to Turkey’s Islamic roots, nor does it require it to abandon its destiny as a Middle East power, even if this means flouting United States-led policies in the region.
Erdogan believes that, by exercising Turkey’s capacity for mediation, he will recover the burden of his Ottoman forbears as the guarantors of peace and security in the Mashreq.
Iran and Turkey are bound to assert their Islamic credentials more and more as they reach out to the Arab masses.
The Chief Prosecutor also formally recommended that Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, President Abdullah Gul, and 69 other leading politicians be banned from politics five years.
Its democratic content was also much weaker, assigning, for example, enormous power (and a military majority) to the National Security Council.
This may be why the Armenian Patriarch urged ethnic Armenians in Turkey to vote for the AKP in last July’s elections.
First, the AKP insists that it opposes creating a Sharia state, and experts say that there is no “smoking gun” in the Chief Prosecutor’s indictment showing that the AKP has moved toward such a goal.
This has caused consternation in both the United States and Europe, leading to growing concern that the West is somehow “losing” Turkey.
But Turkish democracy itself is not yet consolidated, and this is a precondition for Turkish foreign policy to become an asset for the EU and the US.
The EU’s role is even more critical.
Abdullah Gül’s election as Turkey’s 11th president marks a watershed in the country’s history.
He appoints judges to high courts and members to the Higher Educational Council (YOK). He selects the presidents of state universities from a list submitted by the YOK.
However, the contest is more accurately seen as one between an open and an introverted Turkey; between civilian, democratic rule and military tutelage; and between a globalizing and a protectionist economy. The AKP’s support came from both the winners and losers of globalization, from conservative middle Anatolia and cosmopolitan Istanbul, from the nationalist Black Sea region and the predominantly Kurdish Southeast.
Gül will be an engaged president.
With the political standoff surrounding the selection of a new president intensifying, Turkey is entering a critical period that could have a profound effect on both the country’s internal evolution as a secular democracy and its relations with the West.
These tensions have been compounded by differences between Buyukanit and Erdogan over Turkey’s struggle against Kurdish separatists led by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which the military regards as a serious threat to Turkey’s territorial integrity.
Given the key role the military plays in Turkish politics, especially on sensitive national security issues, Erdogan will need the military’s support – or at least its acquiescence – for any initiative to succeed.
So what is the EU left with? As its “hard power” ebbs, its “soft power,” as illustrated by the Copenhagen summit, seems to be very weak.
Europeans do not realize how little interest in “European affairs” there is in Seoul, Sydney, São Paolo, or San Francisco. There is a growing general global consensus that Europe is a pompous old has-been.
While the EU flatters itself on diversity, it is in fact one of the least diverse regions of the world.
Indeed, now it is the Union that will need to seduce the Turkish people, rather than the other way around.
He also isolated Turkmenistan from the outside world, forbidding access to the Internet and discouraging international travel.
Now Berdymukhamedov’s small opening provides an opportunity to build a different kind of reform-minded relationship not only with the US, but also with the entire West, particularly the European Union.
There are interest groups who benefit from the current system and the opportunities for corruption that it provides.
As the curtain drops, two developments will greatly influence the withdrawal process and the ultimate outcome.
Will these two developments bring about a stable peace, or will Afghanistan succumb to instability once more? And what consequences are in store for the US following this war without victory or defeat?
As a result, Afghanistan will remain what it was: a violent and ungovernable tribal melange.
Afghanistan’s history of occupation by foreign troops and their eventual withdrawal has been repeated so many times that one wearies of repeating the tale.
By contrast, the problems faced today – high energy and food prices and a crumbling financial system – have, to a large extent, been brought about by bad policies.
A country’s most valuable resource is its people.
A second major difference between left and right concerns the role of the state in promoting development.
The list of examples is long, but it includes subsidies to large corporate farms, tariffs to protect the steel industry, and, most recently, the mega-bail-outs of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.
The right’s deregulation mantra was simply wrong, and we are now paying the price.
SEOUL – Negotiations over the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula look set to resume.
In the late 1990’s, as China and Vietnam were posting rapid GDP growth, North Korea was ravaged by one of the worst famines in modern history.
We should think of North Korea’s economic transition process as a prerequisite for full denuclearization, rather than simply holding out the promise of a big assistance package as a quid pro quo .
Constructive economic engagement will be a tough sell outside North Korea.
The commission was to control the situation, and to ensure that serious measures were taken, particularly in regard to people’s health in the disaster zone.
Of course, the world first learned of the Chernobyl disaster from Swedish scientists, creating the impression that we were hiding something.
It made absolutely clear how important it was to continue the policy of glasnost, and I must say that I started to think about time in terms of pre-Chernobyl and post-Chernobyl.
According to scientific experts, one SS-18 rocket could contain a hundred Chernobyls.
Accordingly, most companies regard the entire issue warily, seeing only expensive disclosure requirements, constraints on their ability to collect information about their customers, and a potential source of legal liabilities.
But some companies actually want their customers to read and understand the statements.
B) 30%
Suddenly, the disclosure statement becomes a consumer application that adds value to the vendor-consumer relationship.
I see this happening already with a number of companies, including some with which I am involved.
But it is not quite as complex once Internet-based services provide the right tools – and once awareness and control of one’s own data become a habit.
The Electoral Court, however, decided otherwise.
Much more importantly, however – and perhaps to the surprise of many benevolent international observers – the Mexican left is nowhere near transforming itself into a modern, reformist, social-democratic party.
But they also entail the re-election of representatives and senators, recourse to referendums for constitutional amendments, and independent candidacies.
HAVANA – I was taking my usual morning swim, but this time on the roof of the Parque Central hotel in Havana, where the sun does not rise until 6.30 a.m. even in May. In the dim light, I saw a man poolside.
What did they want? Well, more freedom; the ability to be published and heard in Cuba.
I thought hard – and checked with Pardo and Rodiles – before publishing this column.
Pardo and Rodiles are probably better known outside Cuba than they are at home, thanks to the Internet, which allows them to publish worldwide, but which is barely available in Cuba. (I met them via Twitter, by posting a request to meet some “entrepreneurs” in Havana.)
Havana’s buildings are stunningly beautiful, but most are crumbling.
It is still unclear whether Google will continue to operate in China, but in any event we are not about to see much change in China’s Internet policy.
“Twitter can create a faster information flow than any official agency,” says Michael Anti, a journalist in Beijing who has long been at the forefront of the Chinese Internet movement.
Foreign companies, he added, could make available more secure browsers that would help “Chinese people to circumvent the GFW.”
In November, citizen protests against the construction of an incinerator in Guangzhou became a widely Tweeted event.
The world should continue to flood the Chinese market, and those of other countries that restrict freedom of expression, with cutting-edge technology.
Bolivia’s Morales also has managed to impose a similar Assembly, though with uncertain results, and Correa is wielding the threat of constitutional change against “the traditional parties, the native oligarchies, and the empire” – the common enemies of all three presidents.
Since its focus is the “law of laws,” the Assembly implicitly questions the status of all public norms and bodies, thus eroding the political system.
Indeed, often it is the state itself, now controlled by a powerful president, that mobilizes chosen groups, aided by the concentration of enormous resources in the government’s hands which has arisen due to greater state intervention in the economy.
Latin American populism has always nurtured itself on this dynamic.
Twenty years later, many revolutionary consequences of that night lie behind us.
After this terrible crime, countries – including in the Arab world – were ready to embrace far-reaching steps.
In Germany, which largely owes its reunification to its firm roots in the EU and NATO, Europe-weariness is palpable.
November 9, 1989, marked not only the end of the Cold War era, but also the beginning of a new wave of globalization.
Twilight of a Pontiff
In a conversation he protested: “No, the Church is not civil society, it is sacred society.”
Those of us who believe in a multidimensional culture will be grateful to him for his enormous efforts, thus for his “catholicism” in the original sense of the word, his all-embracing concerns.
This was all the more relevant to the extent that Pope John Paul II is not enamored with the United States.
For some time I thought that the Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was probably the best way to ensure that political leaders do not overstay their welcome, and, just as importantly, wear out their effectiveness.
Of course, it is always very hard for leaders to relinquish power. Some have done so, more or less voluntarily, only to re-emerge suddenly from oblivion.
Disconnection is the beginning, followed by the belief that one is the only person who knows what is right and good.
Maybe it is time to be a bit more generous to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and look at the outcome of what he does rather than the way that he does it.
The original Barcelona Process, launched in 1995, was an excellent scheme.
There was some co-operation on common problems like drugs and illegal immigration.
We must also hope that his attempts to act as a peace-broker between West Bank Palestinians and Israel are blessed with success.
The New “Two Chinas” Question
China had overtaken Japan as the world’s second largest economy.
Corruption is pervasive, and Xi’s campaign remains broadly popular. But the wave of prosecutions that Xi has unleashed is discouraging Chinese officials from making decisions, owing to their fear that they could face criminal charges in the future.
A slow-growth China would undermine the global economic recovery.
Major social unrest cannot be ruled out.
This infant democracy was harshly interrupted when martial law was imposed in December 1981, with Solidarity outlawed and dissidents arrested.
But it took the Communists two more years to realize that they could not introduce economic reform without Solidarity’s assent.
While the election to the newly created Senate was entirely free, the opposition could compete for only one-third of the seats in the Sejm (the lower house).
In September 1989, Poland had the first government ever led by democratic parties in the Soviet bloc.
In a few months, talks between Communist bosses and their democratic opponents (often in the form of a roundtable) paved the way to free elections and new democratic governments in Budapest, Prague, East Berlin, and Sofia.

But that would require lowering the limit to walking speed – at an immense cost to society.
Making ever-stronger promises on top of ever more failed promises is hardly the right way forward.
When we talk about the environment, we know tougher restrictions will mean better protection, but with higher costs.
Like an off-road rally through a mountainous desert, it promises excitement and fierce competition.
In the Scramble scenario, nations rush to secure energy resources for themselves, fearing that energy security is a zero-sum game, with clear winners and losers. The use of local coal and homegrown biofuels increases fast.
Rising CO2 prices in turn accelerate innovation, spawning breakthroughs.
For example, Blueprints assumes CO2 is captured at 90% of all coal- and gas-fired power plants in developed countries by 2050, plus at least 50% of those in non-OECD countries.
I suppose it was the 50th anniversary of the so-called “kitchen debate” which he held with Richard Nixon that first triggered my memories.
Béla Király, released from a sentence of life in prison (one of the four death sentences he received from the communists having been commuted) was offered the job of commander of the Hungarian National Guard and the defense of Budapest.
We frequently met at conferences, where it was always a delight to hear him speak Russian – a Russian that had the accent and elegance of Tolstoi and Pushkin, not the degraded Russian bark of Vladimir Putin.
Király and Kolakowski became voices of moderation and reconciliation in the Hungary and Poland that emerged out of communism’s darkness at noon.
Although Europe’s leaders have made some progress on institutional reform, the measures taken so far will not lead to real convergence of economic and budgetary policies, or to genuine economic union.
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Minimal harmonization of tax laws (such as a common basis for assessing corporate taxation) and social policy (such as further liberalization of national labor markets to encourage labor mobility);
In the Council, as in all cases of “enhanced cooperation,” only participating members have the right to vote.
To lose one international lending institution head is misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness (my apologies to Oscar Wilde).
Indeed, a week before Rato’s resignation announcement, the Fund asserted that it had the right to censure countries whose intervention policies threaten to undermine global economic stability.
On merit, some of the obvious candidates for the Fund job, such as Brazilian Arminio Fraga, and Egyptian-born Mohamed El-Erian, are not European.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
Despite such problems, effective measures were implemented to evacuate those at risk and limit the potential hazard from consumption of contaminated foodstuffs.
The JAEA demonstration projects can be used to develop estimates of cost and other resource requirements – and resulting waste volumes – for defined levels of contaminant reduction, but they cannot be used to specify or justify the numerical goals of the regional cleanup.
But don’t be fooled: Tzipi (Tzipora) Livni is nobody’s close friend.
Despite her brief spell in Mossad, Israel’s spy service, Livni is deeply civilian when set against Israel’s militarized landscape.
Moreover, Livni is as clean as politicians come.
And she is offering Jews and Arabs some hope, an open horizon, and low-key rationality.
But, given Livni’s record, she richly deserves the chance to try.
When it comes to the actual number of jobs available, there are reasons to question the doomsayers’ dire predictions.
This type of polarization has been going on in the United States for decades, and it is taking place in Europe too – with important consequences for society.
Labor becomes marked to market.
Rather than try to stop the unstoppable, we should think about how to put this new reality at the service of our values and welfare.
Many countries enacted regulations in the early 1970s to protect existing small shops against competition; as a result, the development of more modern distribution systems was delayed.
In Italy, the limitations on large stores created market power at home for those few that nonetheless managed to emerge and grow, but left them too weak to expand abroad.
And this is true in many other European countries and industries, where the structure of regulations protects suppliers more than consumers, hampering innovation.
Just ask any professional, university-educated descendant of a nineteenth-century textile artisan.
Taxi drivers in France and around the world are particularly incensed about UberPOP (called UberX outside Europe), a no-frills service.
While this problem always arises when disruptive new technologies appear, innovation and adoption are occurring faster than ever.
The final problem with innovative companies like Uber is that the financial returns overwhelmingly accrue to the company’s leadership, rather than to the service providers.
Working smarter is no empty slogan; it is the key to modernizing African agriculture.
The amount of spending on rice alone by Africans equals the combined national budgets of Ghana and Senegal.
Without protection, African farmers would once again be harmed by imports.
They are fighting back and, at least in the rice fields of Uganda, they are winning.
Indeed, with the English language now globally ubiquitous, the idea of an Anglosphere is little more than an artificial construct behind which anti-European sentiment can be hidden.
The country does punch above its weight when it comes to foreign policy; after all, it is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Economically, the UK’s trading position with the rest of the world is strengthened by its membership in the EU.
STOCKHOLM – The next 18-24 months are likely to decide the shape of Europe for decades to come, and the United Kingdom has now started the clock on that process.
Next year should be a period of intense debate on a reform package that, when put together, will, it is hoped, be agreed by all of the EU’s members, because Cameron needs to hold his promised in-or-out referendum on the EU before the UK takes over the rotating presidency on July 1, 2017.
On the contrary, British withdrawal would likely inspire similar moves in other countries, with the risk that the EU, already weakened, might begin to fragment.
Support for the two main contenders – the Labour Party and the ruling Conservative Party – seems stuck in the low-to-mid 30s.
The closest anyone has come to putting some international fizz into the campaign was when US President Barack Obama fired a couple of warning shots across the UK’s bow.
The British economy is now growing fast by current European standards, so 2% of GDP is becoming a larger sum.
Ukraine, Russia, and European Stability
Ukraine is a leading example of the benefits that accrue when a country takes charge of its own destiny, and seeks alliances with other countries.
Indeed, since 1991, the West has offered Russia extensive co-operation with the European Union and NATO, as well as membership of the Council of Europe and the G-8.
But this comparison does not bear serious examination.
Russia’s foreign-exchange reserves fell by $16 billion in one week, and Gazprom’s value fell by the same amount in one day.
Its strong links to Russia are firmly in both countries’ interests.
But we do need to examine the nature, depth, and breadth of relations with Russia.
It would also have important implications for the Russian defense industry, notably air defense and missile production.
Ukraine has been pressing Russia to begin discussions on the fleet's withdrawal. But Russia has dragged its feet, suggesting that Moscow may seek to use the presence of the fleet as a means of pressuring Ukraine.
Russia encouraged and supported separatist movements in both entities, then used the separatist tensions to justify sending ampquot;Russian peacekeepersampquot; into the regions.
Ask Mikheil Saakashvili.
Under normal circumstances, there would be little cause for worry.
But, though this approach works in some circumstances, it is poorly suited for cases of genuine uncertainty like Ukraine.
Persuading the bondholders to agree would be challenging – even more so in light of recent court decisions in the United States that strengthen the hand of holdout investors. But there is no superior alternative.
When the inevitable restructuring finally came in 2012, it was, in the IMF’s words, “too little, too late.”
Ukraine is a victim of Russian military aggression, and, like it or not, its fate will essentially determine that of Europe’s, because the current crisis will define the rules and principles that Europeans live by in the twenty-first century.
Despite the war in eastern Ukraine, the country has managed to take important steps toward democracy since the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych last February.
A major weakness of EU foreign policy is its lack of versatile instruments for allocating financial aid to neighboring countries.
Today, the only thing needed to convert EU funds into financial aid for Ukraine is political will.
Ukraine’s fate has become Europe’s fate. Indeed, Putin not only wants to stop European political, civic, and social norms from taking root within Ukraine; he wants to roll them back in the Baltics, the Balkans, and anywhere else in Europe made politically brittle by economic crisis and/or demagogic populism.
Our national debt is mounting by the day to levels that inspired The Economist to suggest that we may become the “Greece of the east.” Moreover, much of our economy remains in separatist hands, and they, no surprise, are running the stolen assets into the ground.
For starters, the EU should help us create a more stable exchange-rate regime to overcome the currency volatility that has wracked our economy since Russia’s invasion. And, although fiscal consolidation is necessary, given the state of our economy, Ukraine’s most vulnerable people are now enduring a hand-to-mouth existence.
The shape it takes five years from now will be decided in the coming 3-5 months.
That is the wrong approach, and it is producing the wrong results.
He can choose between hybrid war and hybrid peace, and Ukraine and its allies are struggling to respond.
So Ukraine continues to teeter on the edge of the abyss.
A more likely scenario is that Europe muddles through by drip-feeding Ukraine.
Doing so would not only help Ukraine; it would also help the EU to recapture the values and principles that it seems to have lost.
But there were also lingering conflicts in Croatia, notably in the Eastern Slavonia region, adjacent to Serbia.
At the moment, I strongly doubt it.
There certainly are very difficult issues that must be sorted out before a peacekeeping mission could go into Donbas, notably the composition and formal mandate of whatever force is deployed.
We should be ready.
With Russia’s neighbors free to join the alliance, the natural result could only be a new dividing line, one pressing up against the Russian Federation’s western and southern borders.
The dispute over the fate of Crimea would continue; but an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the issue could be made a precondition of the treaty’s entry into full effect.
European governments, however, remain unwilling to reconsider their position on supplying defensive equipment to Ukraine, and have instead reiterated that a diplomatic solution is the only option.
They would then be positioned to secure a “Novorossiya" statelet extending along the entire Black Sea coast, up to and including Odessa.
In such a charged situation, there will always be hotheads, eager to pursue military options.
KYIV – In 1983, the Soviet Union inaugurated two nuclear reactors in what is now Ukraine.
Three of Ukraine’s nuclear power units are currently operating beyond their design lifetime, with nine others set to reach the end of their intended lifetime within the next five years.
In other words, Ukraine’s dependence on nuclear energy, which accounts for about half of its electricity generation, has increased its strategic vulnerability to Russia.
Sending a clear military message remains essential.
Putting in place a rigorous oversight mechanism could help reassure governments and voters, and facilitate the country’s Association Agreement with the EU.
A greater emphasis must be put on preventing military miscalculations and unintended escalations, especially given the dramatic increase in provocations.
Ukraine\u0027s Borgia Campaign
Suspicions of foul play deepened when the opposition's second-leading figure, Yuliya Tymoshenko, a former deputy prime minister, was summoned by a Moscow prosecutor to answer questions related to charges that years ago she bribed a Russian military officer to benefit the gas firm she headed.
Yushchenko's promises resonate across Ukraine.
Pressure must be brought to bear on Kuchma to ensure that the vote in October is transparently free and fair.
These aspirations can be used to encourage Kiev to turn toward the West and democracy.
For a democratic-minded president to co-habit (as the French call it) with the very man who sought to sabotage Ukraine’s last presidential ballot would, I knew, provoke institutional paralysis and political chaos.
Economic growth since the Orange Revolution reinforces that reluctance, because an expanding middle class nearly always prefers the flexibility of pluralism to the thump of an authoritarian's fist.
As a result, something remarkable for a former Soviet country informs the habits of those who are demanding that their liberties be preserved: a deep respect for the rule of law, which is the ultimate check on abuse of power.
That Ukrainians will vote for their freedom this Christmas season is a coincidence of true perfection.
This left the regime to choose between using force to quell the growing resistance or cutting its losses.
Of course, our movement was created out of opposition: opposition to corruption, opposition to surrendering our national independence, opposition to the rule of the bully.
We will be guided, and bound, by the rule of law – and the spirit of ordered liberty that animates it.
KYIV – Politics and sports are often an incendiary mix, as the controversy now swirling around the Euro 2012 football championship, to be co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland, demonstrates.
Child mortality rates have declined in all Central European countries over the past 20 years, especially in Poland, where the rate fell from 17 per 10,000 live births to seven.
When spending is high, it is usually social spending that is badly targeted, which means that only a small share of poor people really benefit.
Poland introduced massive competition by dismantling monopolies and opening its economy to the world.
One year after our Orange Revolution, many Ukrainians see its ideals as betrayed.
Tamper with property, no matter how ill-gotten, and no investor will have confidence, they claim.
They reject the principle that there is a law which is superior to presidents, magnates, majorities, or mobs.
Another group also succumbed to this delusion.
Indeed, this did happen with the one property recovery that my government was able to secure, the giant Kryvorizhstal steel works that our former president’s son-in-law gained through a rigged sale at a bargain price.
If, as we were taught by Marx, belief in a higher law is a mixture of sentimentality, superstition, and unconscious rationalizations, then the predations that incited the Orange Revolution are in reality the only possible conditions in which we can live.
Ukraine’s Watershed Election
But the records of both alternatives suggest that Ukraine under those who backed the Orange Revolution will remain a member of the club of democracies and open economies, whereas under Yanukovich, Ukraine would turn its back on reform, and may re-embrace the grimmest aspects of our Soviet past.
Yanukovych’s foreign policy might not be openly subservient to Russia, but it won’t also be a clearly pro-western one either.
I have pledged that, under no circumstances will I form a coalition government with Viktor Yanukovych.
A Yanukovych restoration would be a disaster for Ukraine, for Russia, and for Europe, because it would put Ukraine’s independence in question and tempt Russia with dreams of renewed empire.
Most notable is the comparison with Poland: at independence, the two countries had roughly the same GDP per capita; today, Poland’s is more than three times higher.
The rest – Yanukovych’s renunciation of the EU agreement, the popular uprising that ousted him in response, two invasions by Russia, and thousands of people killed in the country’s eastern Donbas region – is history.
And the agreement with the EU must be used to drive the reform process forward.
That is why the emergence of a strong and democratic Ukraine from decades of failure is needed now.
Indeed, it is patently clear from his own words that Yanukovych does not accept the legitimacy of the Orange Revolution, which means that he does not accept the bedrock principle of democracy that you cannot cheat your way to power.
It is mind-boggling that an unrepentant, twice-convicted violent felon, a man who had sought to steal a presidential election – and who advocated a violent crackdown on the men and women peacefully protesting against his electoral fraud – should be a candidate for any office, let alone the presidency of a country of nearly 50 million people.
Although the whole world has suffered severely from the crisis, Ukraine was hit worse than most countries, as international demand for steel, which accounted for 42% of exports in the first half of 2008, collapsed.
Tymoshenko’s government also made a clean break with the ancien régime in the gas business, increasing Europe’s energy security in the process.

यही नहीं, शीत युद्ध के दिनों में संयुक्त राष्ट्र का योगदान मात्र एक कहानी नहीं है। उसके वि-उपनिवेशीकरण प्रयासों ने लाखों लोगों को साम्राज्यवादी दमन के जुए से मुक्त कराया। आर्थिक और सामाजिक विकास उसकी कार्यसूची में सबसे ऊपर आ गए।
इसके अलावा, संयुक्त राष्ट्र ने साबित किया है कि वह उल्लेखनीय रूप से अनुकूलनशील संगठन है; यदि वह ऐसा न होता तो इतने समय तक जीवित न रह पाता। जहां एक ओर इसे आज की दुनिया के अनुकूल बनाने के लिए इसमें सुधार किए जाने चाहिए, वहीं जिस एक और चीज़ की ज़रूरत है, वह है सात दशक पहले दर्शाया गया थोड़ा सा राजनीतिक कौशल, जब दुनिया भर के नेताओं ने अपने फ़ौरी अल्पावधि निहित स्वार्थों को उस तरह की दुनिया के दीर्घकालिक हितों के सामने त्याग दिया था जिसमें वे अपने बच्चों को बसाना चाहते थे।
Saya akan hadir, sebagai menteri Denmark yang bertanggung atas isu-isu iklim, dan saya yakin konferensi tahun ini akan menandai momen ketika negara-negara menunjukkan komitmennya untuk mengendalikan pemanasan global.
Pendekatan baru ini telah memperluas ruang lingkup perundingan iklim.
Kesepakatan di Paris akan menghasilkan kerangka kerja global yang sangat dibutuhkan semua negara dalam mengurangi total emisi gas rumah kaca.
The selection process is constrained further by an informal – but, after 43 years, essentially requisite – agreement to rotate through regions every two terms.
Indeed, that may be the main factor derailing the prospects of former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski.
Indeed, South Korea was the only Security Council member country to conduct such a campaign.
OXFORD – When the United Nations elects a new secretary-general next year, the world will face a crucial choice.
Ethical standards also need to be strengthened.
For decades, countries borrowing from the World Bank and regional development banks have begged for the loan process to be expedited; most cannot afford to wait more than two years to find out whether a loan has been approved.
Among their demands are a clear job description for the role, public scrutiny of candidates, and a shortlist with more than one candidate.
CANBERRA – The United Nations Security Council’s membership will be reconstituted in 2015, but it will not look very different from its predecessors.
The challenges that the Council faces today are as acute as they have ever been.
Too often the Security Council goes missing on the world’s most serious security and human rights problems, constrained by Realpolitik, out-of-date thinking, timidity, institutional limitations, or inadequate resources.
The solution seems to lie in some variation on the “Responsibility while Protecting” idea first proposed by Brazil (with China and Russia privately showing some sympathy), which would require some form of ongoing monitoring and review of military mandates.

समिति ने दावा किया कि संधि के मानवाधिकार जनादेश का अनुपालन करने के लिए, तंज़ानिया को उन प्रथागत उत्तराधिकार कानूनों को निरस्त और संशोधित करना होगा जो महिलाओं के खिलाफ भेदभाव करते हैं। उसने यह भी सिफारिश की है कि इस देश को महिलाओं को सीईडीएडब्ल्यू के तहत अपने अधिकारों के बारे में शिक्षित करना चाहिए और प्रथागत कानून से भेदभावपूर्ण व्यवहार को दूर करने के लिए समर्थन जुटाने के लिए न्यायाधीशों, वकीलों, स्थानीय अधिकारियों, और पारंपरिक नेताओं को प्रशिक्षित करना चाहिए। तंज़ानिया की सरकार को सितंबर तक इस फैसले पर प्रतिक्रिया देनी है।

Political impediments often enable lax arrangements to linger even after they are recognized as inefficient.
Institutional investors receive funds from individuals and invest them in publicly traded companies.
However, some events – such as a wave of corporate scandals or a stock market crash – can interrupt the ordinary pro-insider operations of interest-group politics by leading ordinary citizens to pay attention corporate governance failures.
It also assumes China’s annual growth rate will stabilize at 6.5-7%, thereby enabling the risks posed by pockets of excessive leverage in the shadow-banking system to be gradually defused, even as the economy’s growth engines continue to shift from exports and public capital spending toward domestic consumption and private investment.
This experimental approach by central banks has involved the conscious decoupling of financial-asset prices from their fundamentals.
The fact is that central banks do not have the tools to deliver rapid, sustainable, and inclusive growth on their own.
The United States’ trade and current account deficits have begun to shrink relative to American and world GDP.
The prospect of a truly hard landing – that global investors wake up one morning, suddenly recognize the US current account’s cannot be sustained, dump dollars, and bring about a crash of the global economy – is becoming less likely with each passing day.
Five or six years hence, the world economy faces the danger that it faced two years ago, although the fear this time is not of a sudden crash in the dollar’s value, but of a sudden crash in the value of the dollar and the euro against Asian currencies.
Indeed, just in the last year and a half, the European Central Bank adopted its own version of FG, then moved to ZIRP, and then embraced CE, before deciding to try NDR.
To be sure, most of the doomsayers have barely any knowledge of basic economics.
Commodity markets, too, have become a source of disinflationary pressure.
Perhaps more important has been a profound mismatch with fiscal policy.
All three of the remaining mainstream Democratic presidential candidates now agree that the existing state of the financial sector is not satisfactory and that more change is needed.
For example, Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank, and AIG was an insurance company.
Unfortunately, this is a great exaggeration.
Consider all the instances of money laundering and sanctions busting (with evidence against Credit Agricole last week, Deutsche Bank this week, and almost every major international bank in the past few years).
These policies are complements, not substitutes.
Perhaps the answer lies in human psychology.
Societies with well-functioning institutions allocate the burden of distress in predictable ways.
One answer may be to use arrangements that depend in a limited way on the legal system for enforcement.
Or they may hire informal workers who have no rights, or pay inspectors to look the other way (a related point could be made about workplace safety in Bangladesh’s garment factories).
How to Move China
Indeed, for all the characterization of China as a despotic state that one hears from the political right in the United States, its president enjoys fewer powers than his American counterpart.
Could they expect to see US troops and bases along the Chinese border on the Yalu River, or perhaps a string of listening posts to gather intelligence? Though such deployments would be inconceivable to most thinking Americans (indeed, the real task would be to maintain budget support in Congress and elsewhere for any deployments in a united Korea), Chinese security experts worry about it.
But the composed manner in which they delivered their remarks belied their countries’ long-simmering tensions over the islands, which have come to a near boil in the last few months.
Indeed, South Korea’s government denies that there is any dispute over the islands.
A survey of historical documents shows a distinct shift in Japan’s position on Dokdo.
In this context, the unconditional return of Dokdo to Korea – and Korea’s continued sovereignty over Dokdo – is indisputable.
Both involved terrible earthquakes that resulted in tremendous human suffering and large-scale physical damage.
Such predictions counsel caution against over-reaction by policymakers outside Japan.
The country’s sovereign rating is AA-, not AAA, as it was 16 years ago.
If this analysis proves correct, it implies that Japan’s reconstruction challenge will be more difficult than after the Kobe earthquake.
The Japanese have shown admirable courage in the face of unthinkable tragedy.
It is disastrous because it courts defeat by attacking superior forces: the 1967 Six Day War, Saddam Hussein’s challenge to the United States and his attack on Iran, Yasir Arafat’s fighting an endless battle in which he was always defeated, and so on.
That is why the kind of tactics that work well in conflicts elsewhere in the world do not function in the Middle East.
For its part, Israel will win an objective military and political victory but is not able to destroy Hezbollah for several reasons.
Naturally, most other Lebanese are unhappy that Hezbollah’s adventurism has dragged their country into war and inflicted great destruction on it.
At the same time, though, it will confine its threats mainly to the verbal level.
Sometimes errors are not discovered until later, when they are working papers, as with Reinhart and Rogoff, or after publication, as with Nobel laureate Ken Arrow, who had to correct a mistake in the proof of his famous impossibility theorem.
That sounds simple, but it is a much higher hurdle than politicians in Europe and the US have set for themselves in recent years.
Both could be expansionary – or not, depending on details and circumstances.
This is a crucial outcome.
However, progress has not gone as far or as fast as Pachauri and others would have liked.
Doing so would allow the IPCC to get on with its work – and enable governments around the world to focus on the challenges of climate change and the urgency of tackling them.
It is easy to see where Obiang – who seized power in Equatorial Guinea after killing his predecessor – gets the money that he tosses around.
My nieces and nephews in Equatorial Guinea still go to school on an empty stomach. They return home by mid-day to help supplement the household income by selling doughnuts in the streets – at a time when they are supposed to be completing homework.
Unfreezing Credit
Consider, for example, the real possibility that a large indebted financial institution faces a run on its deposits, as Lehman did, and starts dumping loans onto the market.
Any voluntary resumption of lending will necessitate reducing both fears and potential opportunities.
Perhaps, therefore, a mix of the two approaches can work best, with the authorities buying illiquid assets, which can help even unregulated entities, even while cleaning up the regulated financial sector, focusing particularly on entities that are likely to become distressed.
First, it must be understood that the EU and the US start from very different points in the race to reduce emissions. When the then 15-nation EU ratified the Kyoto Protocol, it pledged to cut CO2 emissions by 8% from 1990 levels by 2012.
But the bill that finally emerges from Congress is likely to have less ambitious targets.
Early and constant communication with Obama’s top climate officials would help the EU understand the likely US position.
Americans’ attitudes toward climate change have been transformed under the Obama administration.
Indeed, the UN has had two major recent triumphs, with two more on the way before the end of this year.
The precise value of the peace, poverty reduction, and environmental cooperation made possible by the UN is incalculable.
Some UN programs should be merged or closed, while other new SDG-related UN programs should be created.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains the world’s moral charter, and the SDGs promise to provide new guideposts for global development cooperation.
In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, great civil-rights battles were waged against racial discrimination and apartheid, followed by struggles to advance the rights of the disabled and sexual minorities.
Moreover, states are not legally bound to change the policies or laws that are deemed to be violating their international human-rights obligations.
Indeed, frustrated with adults’ failure to discharge what should be their duties toward children, young people are forming child-marriage-free zones, launching anti-slavery groups, and organizing education-rights campaigns.
For more than a half-century, no US president was willing to pay the political price for admitting failure and resuming diplomatic relations with the island.
Perhaps his effort to change America’s Cuba policy – which means challenging the highly disciplined lobby opposing the rule of Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl – will show the way.
By maintaining Cold War-era financial subsidies to Cuba, Russia has tried to ensure that the island remained a geopolitical flashpoint, as it was for the Soviet Union.
Ultimately, world peace is in the hands of leaders.
The government denied this, claiming that the experiments were conducted without its knowledge by academic researchers “for scientific interest.”
Indeed, Robert Schuman once declared that “Europe will not be built in a day, nor as part of an overall design. It will be built through the practical achievements that first create a sense of common purpose.”
North and South Korea must begin the work of reconciliation and community-building on their own initiative, as France and Germany did in 1952.
Although the United Kingdom is currently building two carriers of its own, the Royal Navy is years away from the capability to deliver instant airpower from the sea.
The operation, held annually and comprising 5-10 combat vessels, 1-2 auxiliary ships, and 2-4 maritime-patrol aircraft, includes forces from 26 European navies, and has undoubtedly helped to discourage, if not end, pirate attacks.
Adopting a comprehensive legal framework would be a useful first step.
While reducing such capabilities might seem like an expedient way to cut costs, European governments must not lose sight of their long-term security priorities.
Palestinians complained that the international community acted unjustly, simply because they were unhappy with the result of a free and fair election in the Palestinian territories, which Hamas won overwhelmingly.
Money, however, is not the only need.
The past year has been one of the most difficult years in modern Palestinian history.
Syria once boasted universal education.
It is truly fitting that South Korea is hosting this forum, because it is so often seen as a model of what investment in education can deliver.
The job is not done.
Less than 1% of the earth’s land area is densely urbanized, and even in the most populated major countries, the share is less than 10%.
But, to the extent that the products of land (food, timber, ethanol) are traded on world markets, the price of any particular kind of land should be roughly the same everywhere.
A few years ago Karl Case and I asked random home buyers in US cities undergoing bubbles how much they think the price of their home will rise each year on average over the next ten years.
Health and development experts, economists, non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies, and banks agree that the key to unlocking Africa’s potential lies in expanding women’s education, freedom, and job opportunities.
Simply put, women must be allowed to decide, free of coercion or violence, about their sexuality and health; if, when, and whom to marry; and whether and when to become a parent.
They are also more likely than older women to die of birth-related complications, and are more prone to abuse.
Attitudes can change.
Europe’s Hidden Stimulus
To be sure, the fact that companies are holding on to their cash, rather than paying it out in dividends, signals that they expect investment opportunities to return – a far more positive situation than in Japan, for example, where companies lack cash to invest.
Some degree of investment will add to demand, which may persuade others to invest – a virtuous circle.
In most European countries, action to spur private investment in local services and transport – both large sectors – should also be considered.
Over the past year, however, the shroud of mystery has begun to drop.
As part of his government’s efforts “to construct a harmonious society,” a tax on agricultural produce was scrapped last year, while the State Council vowed to boost annual investment in rural infrastructure.
He has revived the use of ideological campaigns, akin to those used during the Cultural Revolution, such as a requirement that Party members study The Collected Works of Jiang Zemin .
But it is equally obvious that Hu, the sphinx-like apparatchik in whom Chinese and Western liberals alike had once invested hope, is unlikely to deliver the more open and humane China that they thought he had promised.
When Putin welcomes Hamas’s leaders without consulting the other members of the “Quartet” – the United Nations, the European Union, and the United States – charged with shepherding peace talks between Israel and Palestine, is Russia testing its “nuisance value” or simply performing an “avant-garde” role for the other Quartet members?
Indeed, escalating tensions in the Middle East – particularly Iran’s nuclear ambition – is likely to incline the US to overlook Russia’s diplomatic prickliness even more.
But resigned acquiescence in whatever Putin’s regime chooses to do would only confirm it in its belief that it now holds all the cards.
In general, the exchange of information between the billions of neurons that make up the neuronal forest takes place through two types of highly specialized structures: chemical synapses (the majority) and so-called gap junctions (a substrate of one class of electrical synapse).
Furthermore, it has been proposed that glial cells are involved in information processing through their bi-directional signaling with neurons.
Nevertheless, even using this technology, full reconstruction of whole brains is possible only for relatively simple nervous systems.
If we succeed, we will finally be able to see the forest – without having to look for every tree.
The recent upsurge in milk-sharing can be explained by shifting attitudes toward breastfeeding in many countries, with the public-health and medical communities sending the message that breastfeeding is the best option for babies.
And, of course, it is possible that some breast-milk sellers adulterate their product to boost volumes and profits.
In this sense, though breastfeeding remains the best choice for able mothers, the single-minded focus on breastfeeding that prevails today could have adverse effects – at least in advanced countries where safe alternatives are available.
A “strongman” who cannot keep order in the streets is of no use to anyone.
Most Western leaders think naturally in terms of a “transition to democracy.”
But America’s long-term project is to remake the world in its image.
But, taking the long view, can anyone doubt that the invasion had the effect of shaking up the pieces, not just in Iraq, but across the Islamic chessboard?
True, America’s intervention in the Middle East also strengthened extremist Islam, breeding on the resentment that the US presence arouses.
Indeed, looking at the agenda they produced – more than 15,000 words and a headache-inducing 169 development targets – one might conclude that they simply threw everything they had heard into the document.
Other targets assume that helping “small-scale artisanal fishers” and “to promote sustainable tourism” are among the most important goals for the world. There is even a target to “ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature”.
In lofty language, the UN claims that the Agenda for Sustainable Development’s 169 targets are “integrated and indivisible.” This is nonsense.
People often attribute this to China’s hukou, or household registration system, which separates the urban privileged and the rural poor from the start of their lives.
Households can keep this entitlement for the term of the lease (now 30 years), but they do not have a property right in the land itself.
To achieve “permanent urbanization,” China must develop a new safety net.
Rather the key to success will be to make rural immigrants to Chinese cities equal citizens in terms of opportunities and public services.
The most important question to ask of any financial system is how much loss-absorbing equity major banks have on their balance sheets.
At the end of 2012, when Hoenig started to publish his US GAAP-IFRS adjustment, the average for the largest US banks was roughly 4% equity.
The latest significant development to surface is what Better Markets, a pro-reform group that has put out a helpful fact sheet, calls “de facto guaranteed foreign subsidiaries” that trade derivatives – a murky phenomenon that likely involves all the big players.
TOKYO – US President Barack Obama’s hesitations, ambivalence, U-turns, and political gamesmanship with the US Congress over punishing Syria for its use of chemical weapons has achieved only two things with certainty: it has raised Russia’s diplomatic profile for the first time in many years, and it has spooked those of America’s allies – from Saudi Arabia and Israel to Japan and South Korea – that rely heavily on US promises. To minimize the impact of both consequences, the United States now must enforce with utmost determination its agreement with Russia on eliminating Syria’s chemical weapons.
As Pakistan’s then-president, Pervez Musharraf, dismissively put it when I visited Islamabad as Japan’s defense minister, “Democracy?
His government continues to place great faith in the Japan-US alliance as the bedrock of Japanese (and Asian) security.
If America attempts to wash its hands of the Middle East in the coming years, will a similar rupture be inevitable?
First, would even a partial withdrawal of military force create a security vacuum that could be filled by a rival – say, China or Iran? And, second, would any diminution of America’s commitment to the region incite the kind of instability that breeds failed states and terrorist havens?
They will need to be clear with themselves about whether they have the means to achieve their national security ends.
The notion that the dollar’s global dominance is contributing to financial repression represents a significant historical shift.
If they failed to do so, their “undervalued” exchange rates were criticized as unfair.
The problem, as McKinnon recognized, is that these speculative inflows of “hot” money have weakened China’s macroeconomic tools and fueled ever more financial repression.
It is time for US leaders to recognize that what former French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing called the “exorbitant privilege” that the dollar’s global dominance affords America also entails considerable responsibility.
Indeed, whereas the US Federal Reserve terminated its large-scale securities purchases, known as “quantitative easing” (QE), last month, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank recently announced the expansion of their monetary-stimulus programs.
But a new issue risks bringing about a similarly problematic outcome: By repeatedly repressing financial-market volatility over the last few years, central-bank policies have inadvertently encouraged excessive risk-taking, which has pushed many financial-asset prices higher than economic fundamentals warrant.
NEW YORK – Since my teenage years, I have been fascinated by the permutations and machinations of national politics.
The Tea Party in the US is a case in point.
As a result, Western economies are running chronically below their potential – and risk undermining their future potential.
Over time, Western political systems will evolve to meet the needs of their economies.
Even now, seven years after the global financial crisis triggered the Great Recession, “official” unemployment among African-Americans is more than 9%.
But, with the bulk of the increase in incomes since the US “recovery” began going to the top 1% of earners, it is not true for most communities.
Inflation hawks argue that the inflation dragon must be slayed before one sees the whites of its eyes: Fail to act now and it will burn you in a year or two.
The Fed should simultaneously stimulate the economy and tame the financial markets.
But the killing of Eric Garner in New York City, like that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer and of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland in November, reflect the heightened risk that young African-American men face at the hands of the police in many US cities.
Over and over again, the same story plays out: a local power-broker is willing, even eager, to support the new US-backed government, only to be denounced as a Taliban member by a fellow Afghan – typically for local political or personal reasons – to unwitting American troops.
“There are those who will seize upon the report and say ‘see what Americans did,’” Feinstein said, “and they will try to use it to justify evil actions or to incite more violence.
We Americans must learn how to look at ourselves and our government the way others do.
All sides acknowledged progress toward eliminating Iran’s capacity to achieve a nuclear “breakout,” which would enable it to begin weapons production within a year.
It is now understood that even the sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime may have impeded the transition to majority rule.
The Revolutionary&nbsp;Guard is not worried about whether it is in the international community’s good graces.
But a strategy of compartmentalization requires focus and fortitude on the part of policymakers.
Weakness in the rest of the world implies a stronger dollar, which will invariably weaken US growth.
And Japan seems to be intent on inflicting on itself a second, growth-retarding consumption-tax increase.
The risk of a global crash has been low, because deleveraging has proceeded apace in most advanced economies; the effects of fiscal drag are smaller; monetary policies remain accommodative; and asset reflation has had positive wealth effects. Moreover, many emerging-market countries are still growing robustly, maintain sound macroeconomic policies, and are starting to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms.
Nonetheless, they are slowing down capital spending and consumption, given the option value of waiting during uncertain times.
After-tax income for the middle three quintiles in 2010 was 40% higher – equivalent to 1.1% average annual growth.
But that is not money that America’s poor can spend, so some downward adjustment should be applied.
America’s poor in 1979 lagged so far behind normal OECD social democracies in terms of health and health care that even though each extra dollar produced only $0.25 of real health-care services, that $0.25 was worth about one dollar to the poor in terms of material wellbeing.
After independence in 1947, India adopted an inward-looking planning system that focused on heavy industry.
Likewise, India’s annual per capita income of $1,760 is just one-fifth that of China. Even more striking, while 95% of the Chinese population is literate, the proportion for India is only 74% – and only 65% for women.
No one should expect an Indian-American alliance any time soon, given historical Indian public opinion. But one can predict a relationship in the coming years that will be both sui generis and stronger.
Meanwhile, scaling up infrastructure spending could provide an often-overlooked opportunity for long-term institutional investors.
There is little reason for US policymakers to accept this fate. Low interest rates, the dollar’s continuing role as the world’s main reserve currency, and the capacity of the public sector to increase spending make the case for higher infrastructure spending compelling.
Second, even if the Fed acts quickly, investor appetite for returns will anchor yields.
Given the deflationary impact of a stronger currency – and the Fed’s general intolerance of deflation – there is good reason to believe that the Fed will exercise caution in raising interest rates.
In this context, interest rates would remain capped, mitigating the risk of a disorderly bond-market sell-off.
At the same time, there is no shortage of money waiting to be put to productive use.
In 2002, Western financial institutions were thought to be wizards at managing risk and allocating capital; today, we see that they are wizards at market manipulation and other deceptive practices.
But today, there is no such way.
Last year, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released information about Luxembourg’s tax rulings that exposed the scale of tax avoidance and evasion.
New geopolitical realities demand new forms of global governance, with a greater voice for developing and emerging countries.
They have been a key element of Mesopotamia’s ruling classes for centuries, and their sense of entitlement is palpable.
If Maliki or Abadi were Nelson Mandela, they would recognize and act on the imperative to reach out to Sunnis and urge them to be part of the country’s future.
Overall, however, the US is addressing many of the region’s most important issues in the right way.
The Decline of US Military Innovation
The Navy’s research budget has been cut by some 20%, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – the organization tasked with keeping the US military ahead of the technological curve – has had to slash R&amp;D spending by 18%.
By contrast, America’s technology giants invest 4-6 times as much in R&amp;D.
“Continued fiscal pressure will likely limit our military’s ability to respond to long-term challenges by increasing the size of our force or simply outspending potential adversaries on current systems,” he said.
Now that Russia has knocked at least some of Assad’s enemies on their heels, the Kremlin has decided that the time has come to discuss forthcoming political arrangements – or, perhaps more accurately, the time has come to tell Assad what will happen next.
The administration’s difficulties in Syria emerged early on, with the assumption that Assad would be ousted within weeks of the conflict’s eruption.
Instead of attempting to impose a new Syrian leadership, the US should host a meeting with internally selected representatives to help them draft a constitution and make other political arrangements.
The Congressional Budget Office warns that falling off the fiscal cliff would push America’s economy into a serious recession next year.
The tougher problem will be how to raise revenue.
Opponents of tax increases should see that, because such revenue-raising is really cutting government spending, it does not imply the adverse incentive effects of raising marginal tax rates.
The cap rate could be higher, or it could start higher and be gradually tightened, or it could vary with an individual’s income level.
Unemployment remains persistently high, despite the $787 billion stimulus package in 2009, and house prices, though recovering slowly, remain far below their pre-2008 peak.
But governments can influence the development of productivity.
Such misallocation of resources was not just a menace of the interwar period.
It is no longer the real state of the economy, but rather the perception of asset markets, that is crucial.
The usual question posed about presidential aspirants is: Why is he running? This year, the answer seems to be: Why not?
She seems packaged and cautious, slow to get around to a position on some key issues, such as trade, that divide Democrats.
Evangelical Christians play a crucial role in the Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the quest for the nomination, but putting too much effort into pleasing them can make a candidate unelectable.
They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” – sent his popularity soaring, to the mortification of many Republican leaders.
NEW YORK – It is impossible to know whom American voters will choose as their next president.
In any case, foreign policy probably will play little role in the decision, as the issues that most concern voters likely to participate in the Democratic primary elections are domestic and economic in nature.
Questions will be raised about which sanctions are to be eased and when; about the terms of compliance inspections; and about what will happen once some of the limits on Iran’s nuclear activities expire.
The rhetoric, especially on the Republican side, will be muscular.
The answers to these questions should become clearer during the campaign.
So he promised that his party would try to compromise on a few issues, and offered an explicit pledge that there would be no government shutdowns like the highly unpopular one in 2013.
The Tea Party's rise exacerbated this split.
Numerous proposals are pending to undo significant parts of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health-insurance program (if the Supreme Court does not do the job later this year).
To break the impasse, McConnell has proposed addressing the issues in separate bills.
These agreements go well beyond trade, governing investment and intellectual property as well, imposing fundamental changes to countries’ legal, judicial, and regulatory frameworks, without input or accountability through democratic institutions.
Admittedly, both countries went a little further than the US, mandating the inclusion of graphic images showing the consequences of cigarette smoking.
Fundamental to America’s system of government is an impartial public judiciary, with legal standards built up over the decades, based on principles of transparency, precedent, and the opportunity to appeal unfavorable decisions.
And high-priced corporate lawyers in the US, Europe, and Japan will likely outmatch the underpaid government lawyers attempting to defend the public interest.
In the US, where concern has been heightened by weak recent trade numbers, President Barack Obama is pushing for Congress to give him Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), previously known as fast-track authority, to conclude the mega-regional Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with 11 Asian and Latin American countries.
Countries benefit most from producing and exporting what they are relatively best at producing and exporting, and from importing what other countries are relatively better at producing.
The volume of trade increased rapidly, owing partly to NAFTA in 1994 and the establishment in 1995 of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Of course, if one country erects import barriers, its trading partners are likely to retaliate with “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies of their own, leaving everyone worse off.
America’s Education Bubble
In China’s case, the government hoped that broader stock-market participation – achieved through efforts to bolster equity prices and promote lending for investment – would make citizens more open to pro-market reforms.
This is where the US risks falling short.
But this is no excuse for complacency; it merely provides time for a concerted effort to implement measures that will ameliorate the destructive trends stemming from student loans.
And more could be done to expand income-based repayment schemes.
Software engineers call backdoors “vulnerabilities,” deliberate efforts to weaken security. They regard a request for backdoors the same way an automobile manufacturer would view a request for a defective engine.
An initial report identifies 18 proposals from more than a dozen European governments on subjects including new undersea cables, encryption, localized data storage, domestic industry support, international codes of conduct, and data protection laws.
Principle 1 requires that policymakers “promote and protect the global free flow of information”; Principle 2 insists on promotion of “the open, distributed, and interconnected nature of the Internet”; Principle 8 mandates “transparency, fair process, and accountability” across the Internet; Principle 11 promotes “creativity and innovation”; and Principle 13 “encourage[s] cooperation to promote Internet security.”

निराशावादी तो मानकर चलेंगे ही कि व्यवहार को बदलना बहुत कठिन होता है, खास तौर पर तब जब जीवाणु-विज्ञान के बारे में अशिक्षित श्रोताओं को सिखाने की बात हो। इस सोच के कारण निम्न आय वाले देशों के मरी��ों को एचआईवी की दवा किफ़ायती दरों पर उपलब्ध कराने के बारे में सबसे घृणित यही तर्क दिमाग में आता है: अफ्रीका के लोगों के पास घड़ी तो होती नहीं, इसलिए वे एंटीरेट्रोवायरल दवा दिन में तीन बार नहीं ले सकेंगे।

Uncertain funding prospects not only discourage scientists from pursuing risky or undirected lines of research that could lead to crucial discoveries; they also make it more difficult to recruit the best and brightest for scientific careers, especially given the extensive training and specialization that such careers require.
The problems are clear. But addressing them requires a prudent strategy that accounts for the structural fragility of the scientific enterprise, in which scientists must complete extensive training, regulation can easily stifle creativity, and funding limitations can substantially delay progress.
India’s Data of Discrimination
But Indian society, which comprises more than 1.2 billion citizens, is hardly homogeneous.
Moreover, in the same region, more than 60% of girls are married well before the legal age, making pregnancies among anemic and malnourished teenagers a common occurrence. But, at the same time, most girls complete 12 years of schooling in the northern mountain state of Himachal Pradesh, demonstrating that the north-south distinction is no more conclusive than countrywide generalizations.
On one hand, universities are abiding by long-standing agreements with government; on the other, they face zealous reformers who seek market-based solutions that stress competition among institutions, encourage staff and student mobility, and emphasize student-centered learning.
And if years of schooling do not translate into greater cognitive skills, then much of the economic justification for investing in higher education falls apart.
Policymakers must be aware of the educational and cultural damage that continuous reforms – all justified in the future-oriented jargon of the day – can wreak.
I live in London now, but my roots will always be in Pakistan.
In 1994, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto launched the first national vaccination drive by inoculating her baby daughter, Aseefa.
According to UNICEF, Pakistan has the second-highest rate of child mortality in South Asia.
Vaccination’s Lifetime of Blessings
In the remaining three countries where polio has not yet been eliminated – Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria – there were just 223 reported cases in 2012. This makes me optimistic that I will live to celebrate the day when this dreaded disease is stamped out forever.
Strengthening routine immunization will protect our gains against polio and enable us to reach the most vulnerable children in the hardest-to-reach and most underserved communities.
But, as I told them, they have a big task of persuasion ahead of them.
In 2005, on the UN’s 60th anniversary, the General Assembly, convening at head of state and government level, unanimously endorsed the concept of states’ responsibility to protect populations at risk of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes.
Wall Street employees received more in annual bonuses ($33.2 billion) in 2007, the year before the global financial meltdown.
But the essence of that agenda was – and remains – largely correct.
Whether deemed naive or belligerent, this approach undeniably upset and angered European politicians.
He could not influence in any meaningful manner the national narratives that had sunk deep roots in other European countries and thus undermined those countries’ ability to adapt.
MUNICH – Game theorists know that a Plan A is never enough.
Capital flight does not mean that capital is moving abroad in net terms, but rather that private capital is being turned into public capital.
If Greece abandoned the euro, a substantial share of these funds – which totaled €43 billion at the end of April – would flow into the rest of the eurozone, both to purchase goods and assets and to pay off debts, resulting in a net loss for the monetary union’s remaining members.
In other words, thanks largely to the ECB, the Greek government would be able to secure a far more favorable outcome – including increased financial assistance and reduced reform requirements – than it could have gained at any point in the past.
But are we in the West radically misinterpreting Muslim sexual mores, particularly the meaning to many Muslim women of being veiled or wearing the chador ? And are we blind to our own markers of the oppression and control of women?
On the contrary, they felt liberated from what they experienced as the intrusive, commodifying, basely sexualizing Western gaze.
Islam and Judaism never had that same kind of mind-body split.
Veils of Ignorance
This is not the case - at least not yet - in Europe, where the majority, according to the same survey, believes that poor people are ordinary people who have been unlucky.
Suddenly, two days of training became sufficient before starting real jobs; the failure rate was low.
A bill banning any kind of negative discrimination against young women (including the headscarf) would have been enough to accomplish this goal.
Now its president is lashing out at academics.
The toll of this “taxation” is not confined to bondholders: pensioners, depositors, and anyone else with claims against the government – or who holds a bolívar – is affected.
But let’s not pretend that such a step is unprecedented in Venezuela’s history.
WASHINGTON, DC – The congressional elections to be held in Venezuela in December offer a flicker of hope to a country facing dark prospects.
And, fifth, observers must be free to issue public statements and reports with their findings and recommendations.
The observers are to request explicit approval for any visit, interview, or meeting to be carried out at the office of any electoral authority.
Venezuela’s democratic opposition has finally united behind a single candidate, Manuel Rosales, to challenge the incumbent populist maverick Hugo Chávez in the presidential election scheduled for December 3rd.
Under Rosales, Venezuela’s relations with its biggest trading partner, the United States, would also be re-established in a climate of mutual respect.
Forty-four thousand students are currently part of the
Whichever way it goes – even if Chávez really is recovering as quickly as he would have us believe – talk in Venezuela about the post-Chávez era has already begun.
But neither his tweets, his image as a sportsman, his government’s televised ministerial meetings, nor the articles in which he lashes out at the opposition have been able to stem a growing perception that his illness has launched an uncertain transition.
In the wake of his illness, Chávez is trying to strengthen his movement.
The military can choose to uphold the elected government, regardless of which party wins, or prevent the eventual triumph of the opposition Mesa de Unidad.
We spent a lot of time considering which short-term measures (specifically excluding government regulations and policy) could make a difference. We came to the conclusion that what start-ups need most is greater access to mentors.
If they can’t be bothered to get the details right, why should I waste my time with them?
Each side needs the other – and needs to keep the other side in check.
They may want a chance to try things again through someone else.
Moreover, their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated, they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves.
There is no power – save a new violent dictatorship – that can bring Shi’a, Sunnis, and Kurds to live once again in one body politic.
The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear.
This week, Austria is providing the world an opportunity to rethink its complacency.
On more than one occasion, the actions of plucky individuals, applying their intelligence against orders, saved us from catastrophe.
As long as some states possess them, other states will be led by envy or fear to desire their own.
TOKYO – For 30 years after World War II’s end, Vietnam claimed the global spotlight.
And earlier this summer, while hosting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vietnam encouraged her to intervene in the growing maritime disputes between China and Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, and Vietnam itself.
But, when the fighting ended, it was Deng who had to absorb most of the lessons.
Vietnam’s total trade turnover now equals 160% of GDP, making it one of the world’s most open economies.
For example, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) offer free or low-cost, high-quality higher-education classes to hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet, making it easier to learn whatever – and wherever – they want.
Fortunately, many governments are taking steps to promote the online education revolution. Malaysia’s government has announced a plan to provide lightweight laptops to primary and secondary schools nationwide, and has adopted free Web-based email, calendar, and document processing for ten million students, teachers, and parents.
With sufficient bandwidth, students can now meet virtually via Google+ Hangouts or other social-media platforms and study together – or with the leading experts on the planet. Thanks to the Internet, distances no longer matter: the world really can be our classroom.
Laws against child pornography in other countries may also have the effect of prohibiting games that permit virtual sex with virtual children.
Those who play violent video games are often at an impressionable age.
To date, such lawsuits have been dismissed, at least in part on the grounds that the manufacturers could not foresee that their products would cause people to commit crimes.
Africa’s Inclusive Growth Potential
Creating a sufficient number of rewarding jobs is a substantial challenge.
Similarly, with 60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land, Africa has a huge opportunity to feed the world’s growing population and promote agriculture as a business.
Infrastructure projects, by their very nature, are long-term and exposed to political vicissitudes; but investors need regulatory certainty.
Providing exit options where none now exist could also seed an explosive growth in private equity capital.
Today, shared interests have shrunk and values have diverged.
The first option may involve international conflict, the second domestic conflict.
This is the kind of civilizational choice that sovereign countries are entitled to make for themselves.
Twice in the twentieth century – in 1931 and again in 1969-70 – France helped to bring down the world monetary system.
In the West, he is regarded as an “authoritarian,” an “autocrat,” even as a “dictator” while in Russia a huge majority regard him as the most “democratic” of leaders, on the grounds that he has done more than his predecessors to improve the lot of ordinary people.
More important is that an almost equally large majority values the power to hire and fire their czar – in free elections held at regular intervals in line with the constitution.
Integrating the presidency into broader political structures and procedures – especially into party politics – would reduce this risk.
The habit of changing the rules to keep power would persist after the strongman eventually leaves the scene, but the superficial stability of his rule would not.
The Internet remains vibrant, and street protests continue to be held in major cities.
For starters, the nationwide anti-Putin demonstrations last winter and spring should not be underestimated.
This is why former President Dmitri Medvedev’s “rise and fall,” staged like a soap opera, has played a socially corrosive role.
Vladimir Putin’s Potemkin Nation
Upon assuming the presidency in 2008, Medvedev proclaimed: “We must achieve a true respect for law, and overcome the legal nihilism that is hampering modern development.”  And, in a much discussed newspaper article entitled “Russia Forward,” he declared, “Should we continue to drag into the future our primitive raw-materials economy, endemic corruption, and inveterate habit of relying on the state to solve our problems?
He does not need to modernize Russia so that it can actually compete with the world’s mightiest powers; he just needs to bluster enough that people – particularly his own – believe that Russia is once again among the first rank of nations.
Journalists and human rights activists and lawyers – Anna Politkovskaya, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Natalia Estemirova, and dozens of others – are murdered, and no one in the Kremlin seems to mind, because they are not really a part of the New Russia that Putin is building. Indeed, just this November, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management, died in prison because of his captors’ negligence.
Indeed, an ethos of perpetual vigilance is central to sustaining President Vladimir Putin’s high popular-approval ratings.
The supposed threat to Russia today was underscored for the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, with billboards springing up across Moscow to remind Russians of the sacrifices that victory required.
Now, however, many seem ready to give up this right.
It is an insidious and effective strategy, one that marginalizes dissenters and generates the impression of near-universal support for the regime.
The first timeline certainly receives the most attention.
And the rise of Kurdish military forces against them raises the possibility that a full-fledged Kurdish state will eventually emerge.
Having learned the hard way that they cannot dictate regional political outcomes, Western powers – as well as Russia, China, and India – will likely limit their involvement to protecting their direct interests and, if necessary, containing regional threats.
Of course, these ideas would amount to little were they not backed by modern weaponry, and had the countries whose territory the Islamic State is seizing not failed to create inclusive social contracts.
As the Ukraine crisis unfolded, Russian policymakers and commentators talked about “the end of the Post-Cold War era,” while Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dimitri Rogozin even appeared to welcome the start of a New Cold War.
Cynicism and schadenfreude may also be playing a role.
EU member states have no interest in letting their continent slip back into ethnic nationalism and power politics.
But what it can do is launch a much-needed political process and, more important, produce a ceasefire agreement between government and opposition forces.
Meanwhile, the Assad regime benefits from the fact that parts of the country that it no longer controls cannot be called “liberated zones,” given the prevailing chaos and extremism in these areas.
Moreover, a ceasefire would enable the FSA and its allies to coordinate action with units of the regular army against Al Qaeda bands, which would undoubtedly try to sustain the violence.
BERLIN – The Russian-American plan to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons – now embodied in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 – may open a more constructive approach to ending the country’s civil war, because the Security Council is also demanding that the long-planned Geneva II conference on Syria convene as soon as possible.
Such region-wide instability is not just a theoretical scenario; it follows from developments on the ground.
From Turkey’s perspective, a confederation of Syria’s northeastern region with the KRG might be favorable to continuing domestic Kurdish unrest, much less rule by the anti-Turkish Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) along its border with Syria.
Rather than pondering or devising new borders, regional and external powers need to focus their efforts on holding Syria together.
Warring parties start to negotiate seriously only if and when they know that other alternatives are out of reach.
You might think she heads a charity, rather than Kingfisher, a home-improvement retailer with some 1,200 stores across Europe and Asia.
In 2014, the International Council on Clean Transportation commissioned West Virginia University’s Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines, and Emissions to do just that.
It is even more obviously true if value includes the sense of satisfaction that all those involved take from their work.
Life goes on.
Critics consider it a form of insider dealing.
Everyone knows that actual fuel economy does not correspond to the numbers on the showroom sticker, which are generated by tests carried out with the wind blowing from behind or on a particularly smooth road surface.
As regulators’ focus turned toward limiting global warming, there were tremendous incentives to manufacture vehicles that produced fewer greenhouse-gas emissions, even if that meant, as with diesel engines, emitting other gases and micro-particles that are much more harmful to humans in their vicinity.
Its consequences are about to catch up with America, and the world.
Thus, it made sense to pursue a fiscal stimulus of some kind in early 2009.
Most American politicians like to think and talk only about the US.
Some people expected Paul Ryan, a rising star within the Republican Party who will become Chairman of the House budget committee in the next Congress, to provide a fiscally responsible anchor to the next round of the deficit debate in the US.
Sarkozy, despite initial attempts to roll back some French entitlements, has thus far produced less reform than Cameron or Harper, let alone Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher in the 1980’s.

But the size of the welfare state – and the erosion of incentives to work, save, and invest, owing to high taxes and bloated transfer payments – is a major impediment to faster income growth.
But comparing the US, Canada, the UK, and France reveals that the stakes are immense.

In this time of crisis and unemployment, the American public may question freer trade.
If he achieves this, Obama’s long trip will be valuable for Americans, and Asians will realize that it was worth waiting for him.
Those negotiations failure are generally attributed to India and the United States, but most observers seem to agree that America’s responsibility was greater.
These attitudes also largely echo their less convincing economic performance.
As regulation is a form of competition between governments, focusing on improved regulation increasingly looks like the best channel of influence available to OECD countries.
Even though each new store takes away business from Wal-Mart stores established nearby, ever-improving supply efficiencies help maintain the chain’s overall growth.
I have nothing against big box stores.
Big-box stores are not exactly attractive – hence their name. If they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years, will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth?
Americans, in turn, must think about where the proper balance lies between aesthetics, community, and low prices.
It was suggested that these outcomes required a force equivalent to a multi-story fall or major motor-vehicle accident, causing immediate symptoms or collapse.
These findings, combined with the immature anatomy of the infant dura, suggest that dural bleeding in young babies may be a natural protective device – a reservoir to prevent backflow into the brain’s blood vessels during the pressure fluctuations of normal labor and delivery.
They simply predict the likelihood that specific findings will be categorized as abusive, and that, consequently, the child’s caregiver at the time will be accused or convicted of abuse, regardless of the accuracy of the diagnosis.
After a reportedly tough meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vice Marshall Choe Ryong-hae, one of the four members of North Korea’s ruling presidium, the US-China summit in California took place with North Korea as one of the central points of discussion.
Though Chinese leaders became more active by hosting the six-party talks, they still regarded their role as that of mediator between the US and the North, rather than that of a party whose security interests were seriously affected by events on the Korean Peninsula.
Chinese leaders may still view North Korea as a strategic buffer state, but China’s status as a global power is pushing them to view the North in a new way.
Those improved ties matter, because the time has come for China to rebalance its traditional geostrategic interests with its role as a global leader.
However, this impression – correct where the past is concerned – might prove deceptive in the future, because two global megatrends will subject the region to more profound change than all the many previous political crises and wars were able to bring about.
And the same applies to the increasing demand for energy: although the region as a whole is rich in energy resources, their uneven geographical distribution suggests that any viable solution must be built on cooperation.
This would, finally, give the Middle East – a region poor in growth and rich in conflicts – a distinct identity, making it a player in global economic terms as well, and thus enabling it to become the architect of its own future.
Brazil’s finance minister speaks of a latent currency war, and he is not far off the mark: it is in the currency markets that different economic policies and different economic and political systems interact and clash.
It is no exaggeration to say that since the financial crisis, China has been in the driver’s seat of the world economy.
Countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Brazil are intervening unilaterally in currency markets.
At nearly 70% of GDP, consumption in the US is too high.
Whether it recognizes it or not, China has emerged as a world leader.
History is replete with examples of war expanding the voice of those who provided the resources to fight.
Modern democracy, with its mix of universal suffrage and property rights, looks remarkably like a compromise born of centuries of military competition among constitutionally evolving states, according to which the general public supplies the manpower to fight and moneyed interests supply the capital to train and equip the troops.
Volunteer soldiers – including many non-citizens – and mercenary units for manpower reduce even further the reasons for voters to care.
We do know, however, that until now governments have had to subject themselves to increased political oversight when they needed manpower or money to fight wars.
Still others are men and boys recruited and press-ganged into militia units.
Thousand more peacekeepers – let many of them be women – must be deployed in the affected provinces.
Whether it is civil war, pogroms, or other armed conflicts, all too often women’s bodies become part of the battlefield.
In cultures where girls and women are married off and chastity is central to womanhood, all is lost for a woman who loses her honor.
So it is all the more striking – and painful – that for so long this specific war crime has received little attention.
Recently, the Congolese militia leader Thomas Lubanga became the first prisoner to be tried at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for the recruitment of child soldiers.
Maybe then its judges would pay closer attention to sexual violence against women.
As a result, the banks have been focused on returning the bailout funds at the earliest opportunity, rather than using them to boost lending.
But, “[t]o reflate the economy,” he told us, “the Fed doesn’t have to restore business investment; any kind of increase in demand will do.”
The Irish National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) was set up in 2009 to clean up Irish banks’ balance sheets.
To rely instead on central banks to refloat the US and European economies is an abdication of responsibility that will cost us dearly in the future.
At the moment, the UN is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (hunger is one target area, among many).
More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen, in inefficient agriculture, because birds and rats eat crops during harvest, for example, or pests spoil grain stores.
Most of these gains would be in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the world’s most deprived regions.
This month, water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City.
This is a situation that few people in rich countries face.
Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples.
Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions, good governance, great attention to the environment, and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits.
If we calculate the time and energy lost in developing nations to gathering, treating, and storing water, and the health burden caused by a lack of decent drinking water and sanitation, the costs of creating a typical water and sewer network can remain higher than the benefits.
A single reservoir located in Ethiopia’s scarcely inhabited Blue Nile gorge, for example, could produce large amounts of sorely-needed power for Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, mitigate droughts, and lead to improved irrigation.
A cheaper and more successful approach in South Asia mobilizes communities to achieve environments that are free of open defecation by raising awareness of disease transmission, health costs, and the social benefits of sanitation.
The trouble is that residential water use accounts for less than 15% of total consumption.
And, because this arrangement is tied to property rights, only the bravest of politicians dare to address it.
The adoption of technologies like drip irrigation would make current water use seem primitive and outdated.
Unfortunately, the Forum is not yet an official body and has no decision-making power.
The multiplicity of interlocutors inevitably creates a multiplicity of water systems with vastly unequal levels of efficiency.
But the acknowledged responsibility of states in implementing the right to water cannot turn them into the sole paying authority.
But humanity already seems to be making more progress on matters related to drinking water than other global threats, such as climate change.
As a result, the United States and Europe often spend tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars to send troops or bombers to quell uprisings or target “failed states,” but do not send one-tenth or even one-hundredth of that amount to address the underlying crises of water scarcity and under-development.
In Senegal, for example, a world-leading pipe manufacturer, JM Eagle, donated more than 100 kilometers of piping to enable an impoverished community to join forces with the government water agency PEPAM to bring safe water to tens of thousands of people.
Solutions will have to be found at all “scales,” meaning that we will need water solutions within individual communities (as in the piped-water project in Senegal), along the length of a river (even as it crosses national boundaries), and globally, for example, to head off the worst effects of global climate change.
NEW YORK – Vaccines are one of the great success stories in the history of individual and public health. They have helped rid the planet of the scourge of smallpox, are poised to eliminate polio, and each year prevent millions of deaths, reducing the suffering and costs caused by infectious diseases.
Consider this: In just the past few years, many candidate vaccines against HIV, dengue, herpes, tuberculosis, and staphylococcus aureus have failed, at a cost of more than $1 billion.
Today, technological advances in vaccine discovery and immune monitoring allow us realistically to explore this potentially game-changing approach to disease prevention.
At the heart of their concerns is the lack of sustained demand needed to drive growth. While structural reforms – particularly on the supply side – are required in developed and developing countries, they are not sufficient to address what former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called “secular stagnation” – that is, the difficulty of sustaining sufficient demand to permit normal levels of output.
The Brisbane Summit therefore needs to rediscover the activism that it displayed in 2008 and 2009, during the height of the financial crisis. It must be led by the United States and other advanced economies, and backed up by major emerging economies.
Barack Obama’s first act as America’s president was to ban torture immediately.
The stakes, then, could not be higher in the “torture debate” gripping the US.
To drive this point home to the general public, which, in the US, is still easily persuaded by Cheney’s point of view that torture is justified if it saves lives, liberal commentators and politicians have called for a special commission to investigate fully the last administration’s record.
In the case of torture, that is the aim, which is why it is different from other acts of war.
In fact, the creation of the US Constitution and the birth of the American people offer reasons to hope that some of the most difficult issues facing Europe can one day be resolved.
Individual states held elections for their officials, but there were no elected officials (or parties) who ran on platforms and programs that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign state units.
Greece first tried and failed to use a referendum to impose its preferences on its creditors, which then used their superior leverage to render the referendum’s outcome moot.
And yet, in his book The Quartet: Orchestrating the Second American Revolution, the American historian Joseph J. Ellis points out that at the time that phrase was written, few in the country had a strong American identity.
That this is untrue is demonstrated by those, from Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez to Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, who are exploiting America’s loss of standing and influence.
In Ukraine, political forces resisting closer strategic links to the West have gained ground.
In today’s interdependent world, however, it is no longer the number of nuclear warheads that bestows influence, but a country’s ability to get others to go along with policies that it regards as serving its major interests.
If European governments today distance themselves from America, as their citizens frequently demand, they will both antagonize and further weaken the US.
But now Europe’s anchor has become a brake, hindering forward movement.
It was assumed that this would generate strong domestic demand in Germany, helping the periphery to export more.
This year, the public-sector budget might move from a small deficit to what German officials call a “black zero” – a very small surplus.
Public investment is the one area where the government could act.
Europe’s German anchor has become stuck, and the rising tide of anxiety among Germany’s partners should not leave its government indifferent.
Indeed, regulatory agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) arose because common-law fiduciary duties failed to protect distant owners.
Faced with a no-fire rule, shareholders have reason to be very cautious: if expansion is not profitable, they cannot reduce labor costs.
So, where political and social values strongly favor labor, managers' loyalty to shareholder interests will be weaker.
The Failed State of Egypt?
Assuming power only stoked their paranoia.
Egypt has always relied on munificent benefactors to sustain its patchy state and economy.
The US should increase funding for projects that focus on governance, civil society, and strengthening the rule of law.
Whoever triumphs in future elections will lack the legitimacy that only a majority can provide.
Do events like the Paris attacks show that forecasting them is impossible? Or did the attacks expose precisely the type of risk that long-term projections should identify?
Machiavelli referred to it as fortuna:the events that shape us and determine our wellbeing are often beyond our reason and control.
At the same time, such moments remind us that future generations ultimately will judge us not on the basis of what we accumulated – whether personally, as organizations, or as states – but by the impact we had on those around us, and by how well we responded to their needs.
If taken to extremes, Russian society’s response to its wrenching modernization could degenerate into a nationalist revolution led by xenophobes.
Opinion polls, for example, indicate that 50% of Russians support the slogan “Russia for Russians.”
For example, no one even mentions the idea of introducing a dictatorship, abolishing elections, and so on.
What liberals should do in these circumstances is obvious: support Putin’s regime insofar as it maintains the foundation and institutions of a liberal order.
They point to the fact that the world's major central banks - the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan - have so firmly established their anti-inflation credibility that the inflation risk premium has been wrung out of interest rates.
What, then, is an economist to do? One could emulate J.P. Morgan, whose standard response to questions about stock prices, bond prices, and interest rates was to say simply, "The market will fluctuate."
As Ron Suskind reports in his recent biography of Bush's first Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, former Bush Budget Director Mitch Daniels once whispered to himself at the end of a disastrous meeting, "Not a typical Republican package.
BREMEN – An estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 550 million in Africa and 400 million in India, have no access to electricity.
Until three or four years ago, photovoltaics were prohibitively expensive.
Many residential systems break down after 3-5 years when the battery dies, undermining confidence in the system among owners who assumed that they had a lifetime supply of energy.
WASHINGTON, DC – Ukraine may not be grabbing as many headlines now as it did a year ago, but the crisis there is far from over. The latest ceasefire agreement, concluded in Minsk in February, has contained, but not stopped, Russian military aggression.
A Russian attack on, say, Mariupol, eastern Ukraine’s second-largest port (accounting for roughly one-third of the country’s exports), would devastate an economy that is already tanking.
Europe’s leaders claim that they want to avoid giving Russia reason to escalate its war on Ukraine. But that is already happening, and Ukraine’s fight against Russia is, after all, a defense of core European values – and, indeed, of Europe itself.
The eurozone’s GDP remains mired below 2008 levels, and the United States last enjoyed Chinese-style growth back in 1984, when gasoline was $1.10 a gallon and the first Apple Macintosh was rolling off the production line in California.
Coming from the other direction, China’s crawl toward a more market-oriented brand of capitalism also has potential pitfalls.
By contrast, China’s rapid growth should not obscure its need for economic change.
One thing is certain: enlargement has confronted Western Europe with extremely stiff wage competition.
Since unemployment is low among the more highly qualified, higher demand for their services will lead to an increase in wages rather than an increase in employment.
Considering all these factors, the assertion that the EU’s eastward enlargement will lead to net job creation in Western Europe appears to be nothing more than empty politically correct rhetoric.
For example, there is talk of installing anti-missile defense systems in Poland in proximity to the Russian border, supposedly to prevent terrorist missile strikes, which by definition cannot reach Poland.
They will be fought for, and bloodshed is not hard to imagine.
The Age of Financial Repression
When the economy is growing, automatic stabilizers work their magic.
Among other things, Basel III stipulates that banks do not have to set aside cash against their investments in government bonds with ratings of AA- or higher.
A senior Italian banker once said that Italian banks would be hanged by the Ministry of Finance if they sold any of their government-debt holdings.
But lately an even more troubling sentiment seems to have emerged, with Western leaders willing to settle not for “our son of a bitch,” but for just about any son of a bitch who can impose stability, whatever the cost.
Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel noted the necessity of including Assad in talks about Syria’s future.

Unfortunately, Western leaders have repeatedly shown that they lack the patience and dedication needed to engage consistently and humbly with communities in crisis-stricken countries or to provide the reliable, incremental, and prolonged governance assistance needed to prevent state collapse.
But they are definitely stirring up the politics of fear.
But it is hardly an existential threat.
ISIS, despite its claims, is not a state, and Hollande should not treat it as one.
Republican candidates in the US are already using the recent murder spree in Paris to blame President Barack Obama, and by extension any future Democratic candidate, for being weak.
Indeed, the Black Sea region is the Euro-Atlantic community's eastern frontier with the wider Middle East.
But both organizations need to reach out to these countries, a process that should be seen as the next phase in completing the wider Europe.
Recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region's "frozen conflicts"- i.e., those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, of Transdneistria in Moldova, and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority.
What About the World?
There is something of a consensus, for example, emerging around the notion that the US should remain in Iraq for some time to come, albeit with a reduced level of military forces.
There may also be latent concern about foreign policy in the attention being given to the quantity and quality of candidates’ relevant experience.
America’s next president will face a host of pressing and difficult foreign policy challenges – and how he or she responds will affect not only the US, but the entire world.
But the boom generated by such beliefs cannot go on forever, because prices can’t go up forever, and there are already signs of a hard landing. In the United States, newspapers and magazines are trumpeting reports in the last few months that the decade-long boom in home prices may be at an end, and that the bubble may be bursting.
Changes in people’s fundamental ways of thinking are not easily reversed.
Though a small group of collectors invests speculatively in antique or specialty cars, the idea of speculating in automobiles just is not in the public consciousness.
What Asian Century?
Nor does Asia cohere politically; parts of it are democratic, other parts are ruled by despots.
Asia’s lagging capacity for innovation is probably rooted in its rote education: Asian students, when they have the opportunity, flock to North American and European universities.
The fragility of Asia does not mean that Western domination is guaranteed: with its universities, cultural values, entertainment industry, and strong military, the West keeps an edge, but maybe not forever.
Similarly, there is no contradiction between the West and Asia when it comes to threats to global security, like terrorism or nuclear rogue states.
But, already before the recent debt-ceiling imbroglio, the dollar had begun to lose its luster.
There was no realistic alternative, I concluded, to a future in which the leading national currencies, the dollar and the euro, still dominated international transactions.
The answer, unfortunately, is no.
The Yale University economist Robert Shiller has long argued that national governments should issue GDP-linked bonds as a safer way to borrow, but convincing them has been difficult.
Couple these tax increases and spending cuts with the provisions of “Obamacare,” the US health-care reform championed by President Barack Obama, and, as of January 1, 2013, America’s &#160;long-run structural budget deficit disappears.
It is, rather, an austerity bomb that hits an economy in which unemployment remains high, the employment-to-population ratio remains horrifyingly low, and there are only feeble signs that the large gap between current and potential output is closing.
Third, the large government-sponsored mortgage enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should be used as macroeconomic-policy tools to restore housing construction to its long-term trend level.
During the communist era, most people believed that individual efforts to effect change did not make sense.
In general, Western societies, it seems, are experiencing a certain crisis of the democratic ethos and active citizenship.
Instead, we witness a process of economic globalization that has escaped political control and, as such, is causing economic havoc as well as ecological devastation in many parts of the world.
Industrial civilization, which now spans the whole world, originated in Europe.
This provoked a small firestorm of distortion in the West: “Wolf Wants to Institutionalize the Burka,” etc.
Her aim is to replace journalists’ acceptance of the “party line” – even if the party is her own extended family – with a more critical perspective.
Honor killings claim an estimated 5,000 women every year, and are increasingly common in immigrant communities abroad.
Indeed, there is growing concern on both sides of the Pacific that Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama intends to turn away from the declining US hegemon and reach out to a rising China.
Likewise, his proposed regional community would be open in nature, and would welcome strong US involvement, although without formal US membership, on geographic grounds.
Nor does it hold the two-thirds majority in the lower house needed to override upper-house resolutions.
What Euro Crisis?
Worse, the leader of the German delegation to the EU meeting fell ill and was taken to hospital upon arrival in Brussels.
I do not share this view.
The average interest-rate spread relative to Germany of the countries protected by the new rescue package was 1.08 percentage points on May 7, when the world was claimed to be going under.
Any political attempt to stop this process any sooner is bound to fail.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who often complained about trade imbalances in Europe, should applaud these market reactions, which were unintentionally strengthened by her president.
In the wider European Union, countries like the United Kingdom or Hungary are as much afflicted by structural deficiencies as some peripheral eurozone countries are.
Much remains unknown. Are we seeing tentative signs of escape from the eurozone’s malaise?
More generous support for countries in trouble is essential, because the euro must be preserved (albeit not necessarily on the base of a larger eurozone).
Yet, despite the gray and chill of March in Central Europe, Berlin exudes confidence.
He is a happy Berliner and a proud new German.
But to emphasize only these problems, as some French do, is pure escapism.
The places of power in France do not encourage modesty.
Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around €13.5 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2009-2012, before falling to roughly €9.6 billion in 2014-2015.
Greece has not departed from past fiscal norms; it has returned to them.
Such measures would only help Greece to revive government spending.
Nurturing an abundance of imaginative innovators and vibrant entrepreneurs requires embracing a vision of venturesome lives of creativity and discovery.
Most Palestinians are in complete agreement with these priorities.
It is difficult for an international superpower like the US or a regional one like Israel to realize that a group or a people dare to have priorities different from theirs.
For the time being, and until this will is found, the world should give Hamas time to deal with the daily needs of Palestinians.
Hardest to understand, though, is why India is underperforming so much relative to its potential.
In any event, that election suggested a need to spread the benefits of growth to rural areas and the poor.
For example, industrialization requires a transparent system for acquiring land from farmers and tribal people, which in turn presupposes much better land-ownership records than India has.
As a result, industrial, mining, and infrastructure projects have ground to a halt.
On June 3, while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists, the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “apparent suicide.”
Al-Hanashi, it turned out, had been elected by the detainees to serve as their representative.
I have been putting questions to Lt. Commander Brook DeWalt, the head spokesman for the Guantánamo press office, about how al-Hanashi died, for eight weeks now.
Was al-Hanashi suicidal? Binyam Mohamed told the Associated Press that al-Hanashi was a positive person (and, one can assume, a natural leader) who would never consider suicide.

If Denmark were indeed to become 100% fossil-free by 2050, and remain so for the rest of the century, the effect, by 2100, would be to delay the rise in average global temperature by just two weeks.
Direct-current lines need to be constructed to carry solar and wind energy from sunny, windy areas to where most people live.
Even oil supplies are likely to be significantly boosted by non-conventional sources like tar sands.
DUBLIN – Both sides of the austerity debate that is now gripping economists and policymakers cite Ireland’s experience as evidence for their case.
Rather than restoring the banks to financial health and ensuring responsible behavior, the Irish economy as a whole was dragged down.
Growth has resumed, financial-risk premia have fallen sharply, foreign investment is picking up, and exports are booming.
Yet there is some good analytical news.
Efforts to regain national control of the country’s destiny, the Irish seem to believe, must take time.

And an additional 6.7 million are working part-time but would like to work more hours per week.
This group is eligible for Social Security (pensions) and Medicare (health insurance), and the majority are retired.
Or consider minimum-wage legislation, which reduces employers’ willingness to hire low-skilled workers.
Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt.
Indeed, few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections, typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios.
Countries with European-style growth rates could handle debt obligations of 60% of GDP when interest rates were low. But, with debts in many countries rising to 80% or 90% of GDP, and with today’s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon, trouble is brewing.
How much further will the dollar fall? Or has it already fallen so far that it will now start to move back to a higher level?
In falling, the dollar lowers the value of the dollar securities in foreign portfolios when valued in euros or other home currencies, shrinking the share of dollars in investors’ portfolios.
And that means further depreciation of the dollar.
BERKELEY – The International Monetary Fund has been one of the few beneficiaries of the global economic crisis.
The IMF’s first role is to assist countries that, as a result of domestic policies, experience balance-of-payments crises.
It would be more efficient to pool the reserves of countries that need them at different times.
The IMF, with its universal membership, is more representative, and it has a larger expert staff.
But, as the sub-prime mortgage debacle reminds us, large countries’ policies can place the global financial system at risk. The Fund, wary of biting the hand that feeds it, has been reluctant to issue strong warnings in such instances.
If the Fund does not provide a clear vision of its future by then, the opportunity will have been missed.
Where does Shanghai stand?
The non-Westerner, however, would rather place tradition above innovation.
The Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values: there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead.
If we accept the above definition of the West as a mindset, this leaves open three major questions: can the East be modernized without being Westernized? Where do we draw the line between West and East?
Vast groups who live in the West, Western and non-Western fundamentalists, fight the unending Westernization process in the name of tradition.
Addressing them will require a broad range of policy interventions.
Meanwhile, rapid technological change, including distributed manufacturing and digital business, has put many people aged 50-65 out of work.
It is unfortunate that precisely when loosening restrictions on immigration would help labor markets, the world is experiencing a spike in xenophobic attitudes and politics.
That is why well-functioning labor markets increasingly require both firm leadership and open minds.
Land was relatively abundant and allocated by tribal chiefs without regard to Western-style property rights.
Instead, anti-colonial liberation leaders often developed personality cults and hogged power for decades.
Structure, institutions, and policies are critical determinants, as is the availability of qualified technical and administrative personnel.
On the other side, Europe and the United States face stagnation – indeed, a Japanese-style malaise – and stubbornly high unemployment.
The outcome of premature fiscal consolidation is all but foretold: growth will slow, tax revenues will diminish, and the reduction in deficits will be disappointing.
Politics aside, property bubbles leave in their wake a legacy of debt and excess capacity in real estate that is not easily rectified – especially when politically connected banks resist restructuring mortgages.
The problem is politics: in the US, the Republican Party would rather see President Barack Obama fail than the economy succeed.
PRINCETON – Barack Obama worked for three years as a community organizer on Chicago’s blighted South Side, so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in America.
Again, Obama has both the background – with his family ties to Kenya – and a promising policy, to increase America’s foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012, using the money to stabilize failing states and bring sustainable growth to Africa. (Currently, of all the OECD donor nations, only Greece gives a lower percentage of its gross national income than the United States does.)
The global ethical challenge that has been most prominent in the campaign is climate change.
Monetary policy is usually the first line of defense in such situations.
But what could take the place of the stable exchange rate as an anchor for monetary policy and for tying down inflation expectations?
Only a shift in strategic focus would be needed to anchor monetary policy with a long-run target range for low inflation.
Unfortunately, the new sanctions are unlikely to be any more effective than the first two rounds.
The results amounted to little more than a pin prick.
But Europe’s negotiating experience raises doubts about that prospect, as Iran remains unequivocal about never abandoning its nuclear fuel cycle program.
Absent a dramatic improvement in the Middle East’s grim political landscape, the failure of deterrence would bring the sum of all the fears of our nuclear age upon us.
Unilateralism seems very expedient to shortsighted politicians, for it obviates the need for what they perceive as the mess of actual negotiations – that is, meeting their counterparts face to face and discovering the human results of their policies.
In the absence of relatively well-paying jobs, what will happen to the lines of unemployed Gazans? The potential flight of employment seekers – a formidable force worldwide – is only one problem.
Serious face-to-face talks, in accordance to international law and with the help of the international community, are the only way forward.
So while some members may walk out, Sharon can easily hold on to control of the party.
Today, most Israelis believe that this step, though justified on strategic grounds in the face of constant attacks by the Lebanese group Hizbollah, convinced Palestinians that violence worked.
Will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the Gaza Strip, or will that area dissolve into bloody battles among Palestinian factions and a staging area for attacks into Israel that will bring reprisal raids?
What Next for Europe?
Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim, and, unless the dispute is resolved soon, the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007.
Unfortunately, the host of the 2000 summit was José Manuel Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission, who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy.
Now, with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance, the battle will be firmly on the EU’s agenda in 2006.
It distracts the ECB, adds to the impression that Europe is bad, and, more importantly, will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings.
In the end, whatever light there is, it may not shine until 2007, after the French elections.
Follow it, and you will conclude that, ultimately, the war is all about the American superpower’s military victory over the Taliban, so that it can finally withdraw its troops – for a second time.
And in the north, the Tajik Northern Alliance and Abdul Rashid Dostum’s Uzbek militia were supported and equipped by Afghanistan’s northern neighbors and Russia.
On the other hand, the West’s strategy in Afghanistan up to now has also yielded little progress, only strengthening the Taliban day by day.
But the big question remains whether the US and its European allies still have the strength, perseverance and far-sightedness for such an undertaking.
Above all, the “no” votes in France and Holland – and rising discontent in other member states, such as Germany – are the result of the inability of national governments and the Union to respond effectively to the problems that most concern citizens.
The European Constitution has little to do with this, but referenda are never confined to the actual questions put to voters.
A key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there.
Diversity and inclusiveness, through the integration of European democracies with a common project, remains Europe’s great gift to the world.
The existing power relations in the Middle East have indeed been permanently shaken and, indeed, revolutionized.
The most the US can hope at this point is a withdrawal that saves face.
So at stake is no longer just Iraq, but rather the future of the entire region.
What’s more, it is threatened by a de-facto anti-Iranian coalition of all other regional powers, united by their fear of Iranian ascendancy.
Indeed, of the more than 200 countries in the world, only 30 use nuclear power.
But only five came onstream during this period – three in 2007 and two in 2009.
The view that the amount of energy derived from nuclear power worldwide will continue its slow decrease during the coming years is further supported by the 2008 annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency, which coordinates the long-term uranium needs of nuclear power plants within the European Union.
What Rebalancing?
In 2010, China ran deficits of more than $100 billion in processing trade with East Asia and surpluses of $100 billion with Europe and $150 billion each with the US and Hong Kong.
Europe’s ordinary exports to China increased from $85 billion in 2009 to $115 billion in 2010.
At that point, the US trade deficit will shrink.
For both men, the goal of clinging to power was a top priority.
Moreover, the opportunity provided by the oil boom was wasted.
So the government will prefer to muddle through the crisis, rather than risk any decisive reform.
The current government’s tactic of muddling through without changing the political system or the structure of the economy is fraught with the risk of gradual decline.
The economy seemed to have escaped its dependence on inventory accumulation.
This creates a strong incentive to default, because mortgages in the US are effectively non-recourse loans: the creditor may take the property if the borrower doesn’t pay, but cannot take other assets or a portion of wage income.
Lower share prices will now have negative effects on consumer spending and business investment.
Goldman Sachs coined the term in 2001 to call attention to profitable opportunities in what it considered “emerging markets.”
Although Russia accounts for only 5% of China’s trade, the two countries announced a similar agreement.
When one looks closely at the numbers, the heart of the BRIC acronym is the rise in China’s resources, but the role of Brazil is a pleasant surprise.
Poverty and inequality remain serious problems.
The Internet’s domain-name system (DNS) was formalized in the late 1990’s by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
The value is in people’s heads – in the meanings of the words and the brand associations – not in the expanded namespace.
But now someone comes along and says, “We will divide your land into smaller parcels and charge you to protect each of them.”

In fact, we were building an orderly market, setting policies for how much registries could charge, fostering competition among registrars, and making sure that we served the public interest.
And the way West Germany rolled over the wreckage of its East German neighbor seemed almost like an act of cruelty.
Society, Margaret Thatcher once famously declared, doesn’t exist.
People on the left would defend brutal dictators (Castro, Mao, Pol Pot, Khomeini, et al.) simply because they opposed “Western imperialism.”
Their promotion of American military force as the strong arm of democracy may have been misguided, crude, arrogant, ignorant, naïve, and deeply dangerous, but it was indisputably idealistic.
He has some modest ideals, and may yet be an excellent president.
So what should replace it?
It leaves open basic metaphysical commitments and takes a plural and tolerant view of religious life.
Jiang Qing advocates a tri-cameral legislature – a democratically elected People’s House representing the common people’s interests, a House of Exemplary Persons to secure the good of all those affected by government policies, including foreigners and minority groups, and a House of Cultural Continuity that would maintain China’s various religions and traditions.
Although the new tax law is generally described as a fiscal stimulus, it is more accurate to say that it avoids a large immediate fiscal contraction.
The previous temporary tax cuts in 2008 and 2009 appear to have gone largely into saving and debt reduction rather than increased spending.

I expected that many men of that younger generation would also have strong reactions, given how many of them are trying to figure out how to be with their children, support their wives’ careers, and pursue their own plans.
One major German magazine decided to frame my contribution to the debate as “career woman admits that it’s better to be home.”
After all, women have ascended the political ladder faster in many other countries than they have in the US.
In an article on “Women in Washington,” the National Journal observed that women in the US capital have come a long way, but “still face career barriers, and often the biggest one is having a family.”
The economy is slowing – the Bank of Korea cut its growth forecast for this year to 4.7%, while the OECD expects only 4.3% growth – inflation is rising, and some are concerned that Lee’s policies are too geared toward foreign investors and big business.
While most in the West applauded Lee’s visit, the reaction in Korea was significantly more negative.
The upside of all this political turmoil is that it demonstrates the vigor of Korean democracy.
But police officers across Europe continue to use it.
Given its failings, why is ethnic profiling so widespread? The answer is simple.
Over the past two years, a project that our organization undertook with police forces and civil-society groups in Hungary and Spain found that, when stops were systematically monitored and data publicly reported, the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other law-enforcement outcome actually increased.
Campaigns are always more extreme than the eventual reality, but countries should be wary of calls for transformational change.
But inadequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional context, together with poor planning and management, undercut Bush’s transformational objectives.
Nor is this an argument against transformational leaders in US foreign policy.
But Shultz’s Stanford colleague, Condoleezza Rice, wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was, but tried to change it.
Educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age, and what is required to operate successfully in it, will be the real transformational leadership task.
I was the lone dissenter.
Indeed, intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government.
What sort of Union would that be?
That is why former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing feared that Turkey’s entry would lead to the EU’s breakup, and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, “Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear.”
Global institutions, not ad hoc groups of countries, must be at the center of the reform effort.
Three central issues of IMF reform should also be taken on board.
In all these areas, the IMF should make more active use of regional institutions.
A global system for prudential regulation and supervision; a revamped IMF managing a global reserve currency, coordinating global macroeconomic policy, and providing agile credit lines; and an international debt court – all of these must be on the agenda.
Moreover, for too many investors, Portugal, with its poor growth prospects and insufficient domestic savings to fund the public-sector deficit, looks like Greece.
Everyone knows that in case of fire, only the first to leave will be safe. So, if the exit is small, even the faintest whiff of smoke can trigger a stampede.
So each one want to be among the first to get out.
First, governments should not be pushed into insolvency just to save all banks.
Who will grant him asylum?
A state that emphasizes security over civil rights and liberties is easily hijacked by security agencies.
Google already has some experience in turning over information to China’s security services.
Russian society will also pay a price, with the NSA’s surveillance programs giving the Kremlin ammunition to defend the expansion of state control over the Internet and other aspects of citizens’ personal lives.
It shattered the Georgian military, grievously damaged Georgia’s economy, and stirred up discord within the Western alliance.
The intense personal hatred between these men overlays two centuries of tortured history between Russia and Georgia.
Gurgenidze also foresees negative economic growth, a huge budget deficit, and a collapse of tourism, which was just taking off in this beautiful country.
On occasion, he has berated the Europeans for insufficient support – not a good tactic for someone trying to join the EU – and has used rhetoric about Russia that, while understandable, only increases the danger to himself.
NEW YORK – Campaigns, be they political or military, are waged to be won, and the current American presidential campaign is no exception.
Where the two candidates differ is on the timing and pace of this drawdown, not on its general direction.
One of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture.
On other issues, such as trade, there are distinctions between the candidates.
It is on this question that the entire development-aid complex is based.
There should be no illusion that the transformation that the protesters started will be smooth.
For example, the US will again give more than $1.5 billion of aid to Egypt this year. But who is receiving that aid?
That may not be the sort of outside intervention that could cure the ills of centuries of repression and underdevelopment overnight, but “we” need to stop searching for a non-existent panacea, and instead do something better than feeding the Egyptian military.
That failure was epitomized by the inability to impose a peace agreement on Palestinians and Israelis in 2000.
Nor does the appearance of hypocrisy end there.
In strategic terms, the waning influence of a paralyzed Europe is also very bad news for America.
But there has been far less constructive discussion of new ideas about how to confront these risks.
Despite all the intellectual applause, however, wage insurance programs are still not a significant force in the world economy.
With government deficits the norm, that appears unlikely.
In other words, this insurance policy would protect against lifetime income risks.
NEW YORK – Here’s a concept you’ve probably never heard of: “viral sovereignty.”
Indonesia’s government has accused NAMRU-2 scientists of everything from profiting from its “sovereign” viruses to manufacturing the H5N1 bird flu as part of an alleged biological warfare scheme.
It is even more ludicrous to extend the sovereignty notion to viruses that, like flu, can be carried across international borders by migratory birds.
They must get involved. And China must use its substantial influence with Indonesia on this issue – in its own self-interest.
Bipolarity is a thing of the past, and it is unlikely to re-emerge in a new Sino-American “G-2.”
Without actually admitting it, the US was clearly unhappy that these two states tried to play a diplomatic role of their own in the dispute.
There is little reason to react with anger when states like Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa set priorities different from those of Europe or the US, or have different views about how to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran, development aid, democracy promotion, or environmental protection.
The story would ordinarily be a mere curiosity.
Bewitched by symbols of affluence and a level of consumption that she could not afford, she acted like a child herself, with no thought to the future.
The manageable, honorable American Dream of the 1950’s – a decent, affordable college education; a small house of one’s own; hope that one’s children will be better off than oneself – was misplaced in the last decade and a half.
A better analogy for the No vote was the rejection in 1954 of the treaty to establish a European Defense Community (EDC).
Political parties and others who mobilized opposition to the EDC feared a remilitarized Germany and a threat to France’s sovereignty.
The reality is that Europe does manage to move ahead, but step by step through mutual compromise.
Europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity, and that Europe’s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitutional framework that promotes a common identity.
The numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be staggered over five phases, ending only on May 13, with electoral and security personnel being moved from state to state as polling is concluded in each place.
(Small ones were removed from the list when one candidate, running against another whose symbol was a parrot, wrung the neck of a live parrot at a public meeting to signify what he would do to his rival.)
It has been some time since there were reports of the occasional election worker, candidate, or voter being assaulted, kidnapped, or shot.
But, in Thailand in 2006, as in Egypt last month, they were happy to see their political leaders ousted by force.
Only the frail and ailing 85-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej still functions as a symbol of national cohesion.
One man, who was savagely stomped by a member of the armed forces in Tahrir Square in 2011, now claims that the Egyptian people should “stand together” with the military, and that all Muslim Brotherhood leaders should be arrested.
Nor was Morsi an Egyptian version of Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The other solution is to give democracy a chance.
PRINCETON – When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan in March, Brian Tucker was in Padang, Indonesia.
True, those walls did not work as well as had been hoped, but Japan was nonetheless much better prepared for a tsunami than Padang is.
One reason for this is that preventing a disaster does not make good television.
Instead, we should be guided by the best estimates of the chances that an intervention will save lives, as well as by the number of lives that would be saved, and the cost of saving those lives.
In other words, when the Fed even hints at tightening monetary policy, other countries suffer. Depending on just how much the FOMC decides to tighten at a future meeting, we foresee negative effects on world GDP in the medium term, not only for emerging markets but also for industrialized economies.
Using information released by the Fed in March, we have constructed two scenarios: “lift-off” is based on the maximum projected interest rates, while “delayed lift-off” is based on the minimum.
MANILA – The possibility that the US Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade sent jitters across emerging markets for weeks.
For starters, countries should embrace policies that favor foreign direct investment (FDI) over inflows that can be withdrawn more quickly, such as foreign bank loans, debt, or equity investments.
Third, domestic macroprudential and microprudential policies increase resilience.
ISLAMABAD – Relations between the United States and Pakistan have continued to fray since a US Special Forces team killed Osama bin Laden in a comfortable villa near a major Pakistani military academy.
For more than a decade, Pakistan and the US were close allies.
To do that, Pakistan would need help from some of the Afghan Pashtun tribes with which it had developed strong relations during the war against the Soviet Union.
On the other hand, the Chinese have been invited to develop Gwadar port on the Balochistan coast, and to use it as a base for their fast-expanding navy.
Income measured in PPP helps to avoid this problem.
One of them is agriculture-based, and people consume only food, while the other is industry-based, and people not only consume food but also buy clothes.
When it comes to the comparison of purchasing power in the international market, a more sensible question is: how many goods can a Chinese buy in the US using the income he earns in China?
By almost all recent estimates, China has little time to prepare.
Likewise, France’s economic growth is waning not because France has failed to undertake necessary structural reforms, but because European interest rates are too high.
But Berlin would not like a No vote.
A French No would sit well with the Union’s newer members from Eastern Europe, who know Chirac is not their friend, and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mischief.
“The EU is on autopilot, in stalemate, in deep crisis,” claims Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister and an important voice in Europe.
On the contrary, the quick international acceptance of the euro as one of the world’s premier currencies, aided by the European Central Bank’s determination to keep inflation under control, indicates that the monetary project is going full steam ahead.
Moreover, with the disappearance of the Soviet Union as a common threat, Europe’s left-wing parties are increasingly defining themselves as anti-American.
The world is in deepening crisis.
The first is the incoherence of American leadership.
This is obviously affordable, and is modest compared to military spending, but is far above the pittance that the G-8 actually brings to the table to solve these urgent challenges. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has made a valiant effort to get the rest of Europe to honor the modest aid pledges made at the G-8 Summit in 2005, but it has been a tough fight, and one that hasn’t been won.
They should agree to address shared global goals, including the fight against poverty, hunger, and disease (the Millennium Development Goals), as well as climate change and environmental destruction.
Time is short, since global problems are mounting rapidly.
Addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, which in turn involves choices in technology, some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed.
Similarly, it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal-fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide. 
And the US will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low-density population sites – such as the southwestern deserts for solar power and the northern plains for wind power – to the high-density populations of the coasts.
Of course, part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-emission technologies, so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right.
Islam, many say, is a threat to democracy. The West is said to be “at war with Islam,” to quote the Somali-born activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
Whatever drives the extremism of Osama bin Laden, he would not have found so many willing recruits for his acts of mass murder if the regimes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or Algeria had been less oppressive and corrupt.
But this does not mean that political parties whose programs are based on religious faith cannot be democratic.
Such an outcome remains possible, especially if the rebellions fail and more oppression follows.
But the vicious civil war that followed – and has still not entirely concluded – caused the violent deaths of up to 200,000 people.
Is the whole investment world on Prozac?
George Soros once made a billion dollars off the Bank of England in just an hour.
Yes, the big Asian central banks do sit on almost $3 trillion in assets; China’s central bank alone has around a trillion dollars.
Moreover, financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before, placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it.
Which Globalization Will Survive?
Europeans carried diseases to the Americas in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that destroyed up to 95% of the indigenous population.
The effects will include stronger storms, hurricanes, and floods, deeper droughts, and more landslides.
Today, Al Qaeda and other transnational actors have formed global networks of operatives, challenging conventional approaches to national defense through what has been called “asymmetrical warfare.”
Modern technology means that pathogens travel more easily than in earlier periods.
It is thus unlikely that the Grand Coalition will adopt a different political approach towards Turkey than the previous Red-Green government.
Nationalist Turks, on the other hand, regard joining the EU mainly as a confirmation of national power and view all criticism of the country as a violation of Turks’ collective honor.
Many “old” Europeans, including Germany after Schröder’s resignation and France under a weakened Jacques Chirac, share that stance.
When Turkey's parliament voted in March 2003 against allowing American troops to open a northern front against Iraq, Turkey's traditional strategic partnership with the United States ended.
So the authorities responded quickly to the Bush administration's request for Turkish troops to join the coalition, although the idea was stillborn - rejected by both the Kurds and the American-appointed Governing Council in Iraq.
These steps led to the European Commission's recent recommendation to begin accession negotiations with Turkey.
Furthermore, Turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in Kurdistan between the two largest Kurdish factions.
NEW YORK – Sex crime has a telltale signature, even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States.
Looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture, it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this.
All this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person, but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders.
Whither Africa’s “Frontier Markets”?
Every year, Africans living outside the continent send roughly $30 billion to family and friends back home.
While Yar’Adua could use the goodwill that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger margin, the 90-day election campaign would almost certainly trigger civil unrest, and Nigeria’s leadership would be too busy navigating domestic political rivalries to help stabilize conflicts elsewhere in Africa.
The resulting political firestorm may well force Zuma to rely on core support from key allies within the country’s trade union movement and Communist Party, challenging the political elite’s pro-market consensus and provoking debate over the future of South Africa’s economic policy.
The United States’ economy is gradually reviving, albeit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession.
In the second scenario, a two- or three-tiered Europe includes a two-tiered euro, with the weaker countries using a separate “euro-B” currency that can float against the stronger economies’ “euro-A.”
Legal chaos would result.
European banks are far more thinly capitalized, and account for a much larger share of credit extended, than banks in the US, where much more lending originates in capital markets.
LAHORE – Pakistan remains the world’s never-ending question.
The economy is in shambles, and unable to meet the International Monetary Fund demands for its continued support.
The political system also remains unsettled.
Will the economy collapse if the IMF withdraws its support? Will the US increase its pressure by intervening militarily if Pakistan continues to harbor Taliban fighters operating from the tribal areas?
Whither Tunisia’s “Jasmine Revolution”?
This time, however, the report is less clear, less reassuring. Who were the protesters?
The protesters are holding Tunisian flags or signs bearing various symbols and slogans rejecting Ben Ali and the authoritarianism he represented in his late years.
That does not bode well for a domino effect, as no other Arab country has either a strong middle class or a tradition of modern, secular government.
Nevertheless, the new government has expressed a solemn commitment to freedom of information and assembly, the release of all political prisoners, and free and internationally supervised presidential and legislative elections within six months.
But the West (and Europe in particular) will finally have to take Turkey seriously as a partner – and stop viewing it as a Western client state.
The eastern Mediterranean, the Aegean, the western Balkans, the Caspian region and the southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East are all areas where the West will achieve nothing or very little without Turkey’s support.
Turkey’s “no” to new sanctions against Iran in all likelihood will prove to be a significant error, unless Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan can deliver a real turnaround in Iran’s nuclear policy.
Meanwhile, news reports indicate that high-end shopping malls in India and China are increasingly empty.
The number of rich households amounts to barely 0.7 million in India and one million in Brazil.
He estimates that 18% of the world’s middle class lived in North America in 2009, while another 36% lived in Europe.
The median Russian will be even older, at 43.3 years.
By contrast, the extended family is giving way in India to nuclear families, which now account for 64% of households.
All societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure.
They tend to be the most despotic and corrupt, not because poor people care less about good governance – on the contrary, their very lives depend on it – but because they lack the means to keep their government disciplined and law abiding.
For example, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam.
The natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power.
Who is to blame for this situation getting so out of control, and what is likely to happen next?
And its export lobby is fighting fiercely to keep the exchange rate roughly where it is relative to the dollar.
As a result, emerging-market countries, aiming to ensure that they avoidneeding financial support from the IMF in the foreseeable future, are increasingly following China’s lead and trying to ensure that they, too, run current-account surpluses.
But, honestly, the US has been overconsuming – living far beyond its means – for the past decade.
The “currency wars” themselves are merely a skirmish.
The elder Assad’s approach was, if anything, more brutal than his son’s, as the survivors of his 1982 siege of the town of Hama, aimed at quelling an uprising by Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood, can attest.
To be sure, the Assad regime bears most of the blame for Syria’s current situation. But, in the absence of any meaningful political process, it would appear that external demands for regime change back in 2011 – which amounted to a choice between Assad and extremist Sunni terrorist organizations – were not entirely thought through, to say the least.
As a senior member of Blair’s government throughout its tenure, he shares responsibility for everything that Blair has done.
First, inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale.
This “closeness” has led the police to investigate claims that some Labour Party donors have been rewarded with political honors.
With hindsight, it is clear that Britain’s participation in the Iraq war was driven solely by Blair’s determination to stick limpet-like to the US.
Others have suggested that the 26-year-old Tamerlan, an ethnic Chechen, may have witnessed the Russian/Chechen war of 1999, or Russia’s brutal efforts to pacify insurgent fighting in the North Caucasus.
In her view, Tamerlan’s radicalization was made in America.
Indeed, so rapid was the vilification of Chechens that the Czech Republic’s ambassador to the US felt compelled to issue a statement aimed at preventing any confusion among Americans about his country’s involvement.
For years afterward, the US was held out as an exception – a country in which young men, whatever their background, felt truly at home.
Governments are now vulnerable, and politicians are under attack almost everywhere.
Today the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establishment.
In fact, developments or fashions in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valuations of complex and inherently unfathomable securities.
It was playful, allusive, and edgy – in short, post-modern.
So let’s remind ourselves how compelling the logic of the financial innovation that led us to our current predicament seemed not too long ago. 
The crisis that engulfed financial markets in recent months has buried Wall Street and humbled the United States.
Isn’t this the crux of the matter?
Perhaps it is futile to look for the single cause without which the financial system would not have blown up in our faces.
Who Lost Europe?
The reasoning seems to be that growth requires market confidence, which in turn requires fiscal retrenchment.
Even though its fiscal and external accounts are strong, Germany has resisted calls for boosting its domestic demand further.
But eurozone membership deprives these countries of this powerful tool, and depreciation of the euro itself is of limited benefit since so much of their trade (around 50%) is with Germany and other eurozone members.
Germany’s leaders may take comfort in lecturing other governments about their profligacy.
If Turkey has indeed been “lost,” those responsible include the European Union, the United States, Israel, and Turkey itself.
To do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian, Muslim, and Middle Eastern historical trajectory.
Israel is not in the European Union, but it, too, is in great danger of losing Turkey.
But what about the humanities – all those disciplines (literature, history, languages, and so forth) whose relevance to economic competitiveness is not so obvious?
What was originally called the “liberal arts” provided the skills necessary for this transformation.
What is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring.
But the enrichment provided by the humanities was no less enduring, though its subtler nature makes it harder to track.
The key point here is that Europe won’t be able to upgrade the job later.
This was among the problems that the EU’s controversial Lisbon treaty was designed to fix.
The second is the politics of detail, where the new foreign policy chief’s role is to create a single EU stance on the wide range of issues about which European governments still have wildly different national positions.
Who Owns Bolivia?
Genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people, he recognized that Bolivia needs foreigners’ expertise to achieve growth, and that this entails paying fairly for their services.
(Bolivia may, of course, not want to bear the risk of a fall in the price, so it may strike a deal to transfer some of the downside risk to foreign companies, giving them in exchange more of the upside potential.)
The problem in Bolivia is a lack of transparency, both when contracts are signed and afterwards.
The new method spread: chickens disappeared from fields into long, windowless sheds. Factory farming was born.
When this grain, which humans could eat directly, is fed to chickens, they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat.
Supporters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free-range flocks, or by wild ducks and other migrating birds, who may join the free-range birds to feed with them or drop their feces while flying overhead.
Factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods.
In the 1980s, Japan was widely regarded as on the verge of overtaking the US; today, after more than two decades of Japanese stagnation, no one would take this scenario seriously.
One hopes that the Indian government will heed Subramanian’s account of how China grew through exports of manufactured goods and associated productivity improvements.
The bigger issue is China’s exchange-rate policy.
For example, the US built the world’s trading and monetary system 70 years ago, but now Republicans in Congress refuse to support change at the IMF – including sensible reforms that almost all other countries favor.
But that does not make its news reporting untruthful.
Along that tortuous route, the world's major powers are bound to be offended, probably quite regularly.
Its leading journalists are Western-trained, many having worked for years at the BBC.
If American, British, and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world, they must support reform-minded Arab individuals and organizations, even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times.
In each case, the city has managed to protect itself from such large sea-level rises and thrive.
Not according to Nicholls, Tol, and Vafeidis.
Not only do we have this capacity, but we have demonstrated it many times in the past.
This may explain recent polling data showing that public concern about global warming has declined precipitously in the last three years.
Today, however, with Asia’s giants, India and China, joining the global economy, prices for oil, gold, wheat, and virtually every other commodity are exploding.
In the late 1800’s, oil extraction involved dredging with a mule. Today, no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor.
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who don’t just want to trade with commodity exporters, but to convert them as well.
But it is not immediately obvious whether it is Schroeder licking Putin’s boots nowadays or vice versa.
It is highly instructive to read the recommendations of these people and groups, as they unobtrusively render the objectives of their Kremlin clients into a language familiar to American leaders.
His recipe? Western countries should write off half a trillion dollars’ worth of debt owed to them by the Russian state corporations run by his pals from the Dresden KGB and the Ozero dacha cooperative.
It’s just that not all customers have the same motives.
After the government’s infusion of funds in September 2008, AIG’s losses continued to mount, so the government provided substantial amounts of additional capital two months later.
Without necessarily affecting the operations of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, the reorganization process would have simply shifted ownership of AIG’s assets from AIG’s existing shareholders to AIG’s creditors.
In the future, governments should not bail out failing financial institutions’ derivative counterparties, even when they provide a safety net to some of these institutions’ creditors (such as depositors).
It has rethought its traditional opposition to capital controls.
Sarkozy’s popularity is hitting new lows, and Strauss-Kahn’s friends say that he has never made a secret of his political ambitions.
The obvious choice is Asia, home to the most dynamic emerging markets.
समलैंगिक पुरुषों को जोखिम-पूर्व रोग-निवारण (PrEP) के लिए तैयार करना

एचआईवी के खिलाफ लड़ाई का दस वर्ष से अधिक का अनुभव रखनेवाला एक अफ्रीकी कार्यकर्ता होने के कारण, मुझे उम्मीद है कि डब्ल्यूएचओ जोखिम-पूर्व रोग-निवारण (PrEP) के उपयोग की सलाह देने के अपने पहले महत्वपूर्ण कदम से आगे बढ़ेगा। इसका मतलब है नाइजीरिया, युगांडा, गाम्बिया, और रूस जैसे देशों के साथ एचआईवी के खिलाफ लड़ाई में शामिल किए जाने के महत्व पर एक सार्वजनिक वार्तालाप की शुरुआत की जानी चाहिए।
But agreement about the regulatory role of central banks is not widely spread.
Under the new law, Snow would have been in charge of the stability of the entire US economy.
The same problems occur in many other countries.
Who Wants Cold War II?
In its quest to counter what it sees as a hostile US strategy of creating American “Cubas” on its doorstep, the Kremlin is promoting alliances with Raúl Castro’s Cuba and Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela.
But, as a power burdened with too many domestic ills and a chronic sense of insecurity along its vast and dangerously depopulated borders, Russia cannot be interested in a Cold War II, either.
Israel still refuses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because Hamas is part of that government.
We have nothing against Hamas; we are against their belligerent policies, which service in government has not changed.
Nobody in Israel will accept this.
The issue is not one of restoring nuclear “balance” to the Middle East, as Iran’s leaders maintain.
But we cannot reach that goal alone, much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel.
In particular, Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership.
On this dimension, the US seems destined to repeat the mistake of the British.
Similarly, it remains unclear that the Chinese development path will remain smooth.
China might well step in to fill that vacuum, but that is quite different from being able to elbow America aside.
In the Western world, the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation.
In a world of increasing complexity, perhaps what is needed are simple solutions.
But, when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice, perhaps “global deculturation” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions.
A few weeks of rain in Australia has emboldened those who think that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by the United Nations or conspiring scientists or maybe men from Mars.
We need Bill Clinton’s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals.
They want less government, lower taxes, and a smaller deficit, a combination to be achieved seemingly without pain.
But the fiasco in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games showcased some of India’s problems, not least deep corruption and inadequate infrastructure.
But who, exactly, is responsible for the rescue operation?
China’s standard response to any suggestion that it exercise global leadership is to hide beneath its vast internal agenda and plead poverty.
Yet emissions are not just rising, but accelerating.
This is hardly surprising.
Whether countries abide by agreements has far more to do with international processes of persuasion, socialization, and capacity-building – and those can be done by anyone with a good argument.
The rise of former President Hosni Mubarak’s last prime minister, General Ahmad Shafiq, who will enter the presidential runoff alongside the Muslim Brothers (MB) candidate Mohamed Morsi, has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum.
And Shafiq received financing and support from Mubarak’s National Democratic Party (NDP), as well as from business and security interests that benefited from the status quo.
If anything, the first-round results revealed the power of the non-Islamist revolutionary bloc, as well as Egyptians’ willingness to punish Islamists for their weak job performance in the parliament.
Moreover, the MB will most likely have to offer some concessions to guarantee balanced representation of Islamists and non-Islamists in the assembly that the parliament is to choose to draft a new constitution.
The latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation (and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host-country regulations).
This is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years.
Such CSR builds the firm’s image as a “good” corporation, just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as “good” billionaires.
In this case, the choice of CSR spending is focused directly on generating added revenue, much like advertising, and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is.
With popular dissent growing and opposition forces strengthening, the authorities have sought to controll non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and strengthen the security forces.
Thus, those of us who value Georgia’s historical ties with Russia are called, at best, “archaists,” and at worst “enemies of Georgian independence,” as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power.
Regardless of what the Saakashvili government claims about his opponents, our political orientation is not pro-Russian, but pro-Georgian.
Whose War on Terror?
Many Muslims understand – as well as anyone in the West, and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence. They know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations. Only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies.
Almost from the moment of Saddam’s fall, Saudi/Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded.
NOTTINGHAM – North Korea’s third nuclear test is a game changer not only for the United States and Japan, but also for the regime’s last ally, China.
Indeed, China should make clear that, much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper, it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode.
The US will remain committed to de-nuclearizing the peninsula, while the Korean government will be tempted to retain the North’s nuclear capabilities.
Europe’s Path to Disunity
These advantages include the right to move freely across borders, the free movement of goods and services, legal certainty for cross-border economic activities, Europe-wide transportation infrastructure, and, not least, common security arrangements.
The decisions taken by the European Central Bank are a particularly dramatic example of this problem, taken as they are by a simple majority of a body that is not even democratically elected.
The path toward a union based on joint liabilities, against the wishes of large parts of its population, is not leading to a federal state in the true sense of the term –&#160;that is, to an alliance of equals, who freely decide to unite and promise to protect each other.
And, despite having left the church, I still feel a profound reverence for the holy truth.
Investigative journalism and serious commentary, like religion, do not have a profit model.
In our market-driven times, we tend to think about the price of everything and the value of nothing, as Oscar Wilde put it.
And, finally, there is Project Syndicate itself (which publishes this column).

One reason, of course, is that the financial system takes time to heal – and thus for credit to begin flowing properly again. Pumping vast taxpayer funds into financial behemoths does not solve the deeper problem of deflating an overleveraged society.
Deferred maintenance on income equality is one of many imbalances that built up in the US economy during the pre-crisis boom.
All in all, the G-20’s policy of aiming for gradual stabilization of growth in government debt, bringing it into line with national-income growth by 2016, seems a reasonable approach to balancing short-term stimulus against longer-term financial risks, even at the cost of lingering unemployment.
President George W. Bush is endangering the United States and the world's safety while undermining American values.
In fact, Bush played right into the hands of Osama bin Laden.
Nor was the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison the work of a few bad apples.
It is a war of choice, not necessity.
The Bush administration's flip-flops and missteps are legion.
North Korea, Iran, Pakistan, and other countries pursue nuclear programs with renewed vigor.
A moment's reflection should raise another question: does Bush's Texas swagger qualify him to remain America's Commander-in-Chief?
In 2012, the aggregate fiscal deficit in the eurozone is expected to be slightly above 3% of GDP, compared to more than 8% in the US.
As early as the second half of 2009 – that is, before bond markets got nervous – policymakers’ top priority was to find the exit from fiscal stimulus.
As in continental Europe, productivity has suffered from a combination of insufficient profitability and dysfunctional capital markets.
Calling Off America’s Bombs
Neighboring Turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground, giving sanctuary to rebel forces along its border with Syria.
The US government’s misguided move from potential mediator and problem solver to active backer of the Syrian insurrection was, predictably, a terrible mistake.
The Russians openly backed Annan’s peace initiative.
To put it simply, President Barack Obama’s administration has inherited the neoconservative philosophy of regime change in the Middle East.
More broadly, the US should stop using countries like Syria as proxies against Iran.
Living with tyranny might be less life-threatening than embracing anarchy.
It is not as if maintaining its $1.3 billion in annual military aid gives the US any leverage over Egypt’s behavior.
And there was the 2008 agreement to trade nuclear material and technology with India, despite its unwillingness to accept serious new disarmament or non-proliferation commitments.
No state that aspires to win the support or cooperation of others can afford to be seen to be comfortable with unambiguous double standards.
How can this be? After all, power and influence are built on the back of economic success.
Moreover, in remaining preeminent, America requires other key states and regional groupings, such as ASEAN, to acquiesce in its security relationships.
Indeed, China’s strategists are frequently puzzled by the lack of “balancing” that takes place against the US in the region.
False triumphalism breeds poor discipline.
Its effects on risk-taking are debatable.
One might expect that after a dangerous crisis rooted in growing structural imbalances and an unsustainable growth pattern on the demand side, there would be serious, ongoing debate about what is needed to restore long-term growth and productive job creation in the context of a rapidly evolving global economy.
Many countries, including developing ones, will adopt defensive postures, some of which, such as making better use of the domestic market as a driver of growth, will have broadly positive impacts, even if growth prospects are somewhat diminished in the aggregate.
While a relatively high and sustainable growth pattern can be achieved, it will take time.
Second, I described how emerging data could suggest measurement problems with the conventional wisdom that more rapid trading in financial markets is making them more oriented to the short term than ever before.
So the company has wisely left its cash invested in global financial accounts, not business operations.
Apple has been one of those companies.
Could the rollout last fall of the inferior Apple Maps, which sent people to the wrong destination – causing severe public embarrassment and leading to a managerial shakeup – foreshadow a time when Apple’s best days are behind it? The company could be at a high plateau and could stay there for years, even decades, but does it really need $137 billion in cash for new investments?
Credit easing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse.
For that price, American taxpayers will get an extra $1 trillion of goods and services, and employment will be higher by about ten million job-years.
They are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new homebuyers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid-2000’s, or of the princes of Silicon Valley to spend more building new companies during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990’s.
What the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt, but that it has too much private debt, which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive.
What accounts for the apparent lack of effective policy action across a broad range of countries and regions?
Economic deleveraging takes time.
Others support constrained government on the grounds that it protects everyone from waste, rent-seeking, and interference with freedom of choice, and that, when needed, inspired leadership can build the required consensus to address changing circumstances.
This brings us to a crucial obstacle: Government, business, financial, and academic elites are not trusted.
Bernanke’s original speech emphasized several factors – some that decreased the demand for global savings, and some that increased supply.
A lot has changed since 2005.
Witness, for example, the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or decelerating.
Similarly, the integration of emerging-market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor.
In 1988, the household savings rate in China and the United States was roughly equal, at about 5%.
When interest rates decline, borrowers are able to borrow more.
In fact, there was a remarkable contrast in savings behavior across age groups in China and the US in the period 1992-2009.
Austerity and Demoralization
John Maynard Keynes, in his 1930 essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” speculated that, within a hundred years, that is, by 2030, higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours, for a total workweek of only 15 hours.
Work-sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump, thereby preserving their self-esteem.
In his book Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession, Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs.
And for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally, the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally.
Instead, GDP has collapsed, with the Spanish and Italian economies expected to contract by close to 2% this year.
For example, according to official estimates, Spain’s public debt, which amounted to only about 36% of GDP when the crisis began, has almost tripled – and the actual figure may be much higher.
Investors’ subsequent efforts to price in the risk of a eurozone breakup – not the volume of sovereign debt – caused bond yields to spike.
The long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates’ positions, style, and personal qualities.
And Barack Obama has it.
By starting to draw down combat troops in Iraq, Obama would change the image and policies of America immediately.
Here again, the contrasting styles of Obama and McCain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one, between a major change in the nation’s direction and a minor one, between a conciliatory style and a more combative one.
The explanation of why the obvious lessons of the crisis are being not drawn lies in the curious character of financial activity.
Banks got much bigger very quickly, and bigness brought problems.
China can handle its large banks, even if they have large portfolios of poor credits.
By contrast, in the US, the government pushed big banks into buying up smaller and vulnerable banks, and is now doing everything it can to press them to lend more.
George W. Bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him. He then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times, egged on by his vice-president, Dick Cheney.
When they are plainly wrong, why let them off the hook? Here we have had Republicans criticizing an increase in America’s budget deficit after doubling America’s national debt in the Bush presidency’s eight years.
They are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism, if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone.
Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech, take seriously the views of his critics, and defend their right to disagree with him.
Indeed, can central bankers be truly independent? Unquestioning acceptance of a greater government role in taming markets would, in short, give way to asking whether that role can sometimes be part of the problem.
To enforce the statute, regulators periodically examine banks for CRA compliance.
The authors speculate that easier loan securitization may have made risky CRA-compliant loans seem less costly.
Studies like this one are useful in setting the record straight.
The Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with Mexico. And on a Sunday morning talk show, another Republican candidate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, described building a wall on the US-Canada border as “a legitimate issue for us to look at.”
The US employs more than 20,000 Border Patrol agents; but even if they were all on duty at the same time, each would need to guard a 1,700-foot section of the border.
Football Fury
Have millions of Brazilians suddenly lost their passion for the game?
Football teams are now like multinational franchises, with coaches and players from all over the world.
It was striking to see how often the most prosperous-looking representatives came from the world’s poorest countries.
On the contrary, by protesting against the grotesque manipulation of the modern game, they are trying to take it back.
For investors, that outcome justified the creation of the catchy acronym.
And both have worked to thwart efforts by India, Brazil, and South Africa to become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
Unless it improves its infrastructure and literacy rate (particularly for women), India is unlikely to catch up with China.
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – China’s current economic slowdown has no shortage of causes: Europe’s financial turmoil, sputtering recovery in the United States, and weak domestic investment growth, to name the most commonly cited factors.
But there is another explanation for China’s excessive export dependence, one that has more to do with the country’s poor political and economic institutions.
Unfortunately, as China has already claimed a large share of the world’s merchandise exports (10.4% in 2010) and economic stagnation in the West is constraining external demand, this strategy can no longer work.
So in a sense, the Chinese bubble – as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one – has burst.
As the IMF noted, China’s growth rate has been declining steadily for five years – from 10.6% in 2010 to a projected rate of 6.8% this year and 6.3% in 2016.
Many Western analysts, especially in financial institutions, treat China’s official GDP growth of around 7% as a political fabrication – and the IMF’s latest confirmation of its 6.8% estimate is unlikely to convince them.
In mid-September, for example, when the private-sector Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) came out at 47.0, the result was generally reported along these lines: “The index has now indicated contraction in the [manufacturing] sector for seven consecutive months.”
This suggests that the government’s policy of shifting gradually to a market-based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed; even the measures to support the stock market now look less futile than they did in July.
Some observers, including those most fearful of a trade war, will be relieved.
In fact, both sets of critics have it wrong.
And if its exports grow more rapidly, they can allow the renminbi to rise.
But, as investment now rises relative to saving, there is a danger that the US current-account deficit, which fell from 6% of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5% of GDP last year, will widen again.
While the previous round of housing-sector restrictions, implemented less than two years ago, dampened market sentiment temporarily, it failed to curb rising property prices.
In order to curb this trend, policymakers have reverted to the quota as a macroeconomic tool, but this time for housing credit.
But China has attained much higher GDP growth than the OECD economies, driven largely by the rapid productivity gains that characterize the initial “catch up” phase of emerging-market development.
To manage exorbitant demand for financial and physical assets, China’s leaders must address its root cause: the low cost of capital.
To compare, M2 in the United States amounts to only roughly 63% of GDP.
Indeed, the rapid expansion of bank credit needed to finance skyrocketing government-led investment is increasing the amount of liquidity in China’s financial system.
China’s low official government debt largely reflects the role of currency in assuming quasi-fiscal liabilities – not only the write-off costs incurred from reforming state-owned banks, but also the takeover of banks’ bad debts via note financing and the purchase of asset-management companies’ bonds.
By 2010, close to 100 ozone-depleting substances, including CFCs, will have been phased-out globally.
Meanwhile, many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health, agriculture, and the planet’s multi-trillion dollar ecosystems, including forests.
WASHINGTON – In most advanced democracies, a large center-right party competes with a large center-left party.
In some countries, the “Greens” have their own identity, close to the left; but, despite remarkable progress in Germany, they remain unable to reach the electoral size of the large center-right and center-left parties.
As income inequality has increased – dramatically in some countries, such as the US – it is moving to the forefront of the debate, reinforcing the traditional political divide.
Such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream, while facilitating alternation in power, which is essential to any democracy’s dynamism; a system in which a large centrist party remained permanently in power would be far less desirable.
China, in turn, is a major market for final products, intermediate goods (including those used to produce finished exports), and commodities.
In particular, although China’s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies, the government is likely to accept some short-run slowdown, rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures.
Moreover, overall economic performance in Brazil masks an important fact: growth rates have been substantially higher among the country’s poorer citizens, and unemployment is declining.
Most of the downside risk to this scenario lies in the systemically important economies of Europe, the US, and China.
Power has also shifted in the global political arena, with the global financial crisis catalysing the emergence of the G-20.
These countries are able to choose a different technological path to growth, one based on low-carbon strategies and green principles.
Tax havens make economic crime more profitable, and the only way to fight them is to adopt global agreements on transparency in financial transfers, which should also cover companies on a country-to-country basis.
It is not true that we academics did not have useful models to explain what happened.
But hindsight distorts analysis.
Or it may be an explicit bias: an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear, or give testimony that is purely mercenary.
Yet, to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease.
Malala’s Revolution
Dawn, Pakistan’s largest-circulation English-language newspaper, reported that Hakimullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban’s leader, had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad in response.
But, even with this growth rate, girls still accounted for just 44.3% of the total number of enrolled students in 2010.
She will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway.
Some 4.25 million are displaced internally, and more than 1.5 million have fled the country, sheltering as refugees mainly in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.
Delivery problems abound in the war zones, but not everywhere.
But it remains the case that there are no obvious takers for a military role, partly because of the scale, difficulty, and risk of the commitment required, and partly because of the likely political and legal costs, given the minimal prospect of Security Council endorsement.
Painful concessions will be required from both sides if the Geneva conference is even to convene, let alone reach agreement on a cease-fire and transitional administration.
It is hard to find a US ambassador in any part of the world who has not embraced the challenge of mastering these communication technologies.
All fun stuff.
She did what any good – and, in her case, superb – diplomat should do: maintain relations with both sides and try to find a way forward.
Lo and behold, political leaders, especially tough and terrible ones like Assad, tend not to embrace a process whose stated purpose is to eliminate them.
But, in terms of growth and living standards, the cost of economic diversification, when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, eventually outweighs the benefits.
When the private and social returns of investment diminish too much, growth cannot be sustained indefinitely, even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while.
First, in one or several dimensions, some part of the economy’s base of tangible, intangible, and natural-resource assets is being run down.
Contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays, some degree of Keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period.
Not long before he died, Kuznets recommended to a young colleague that one ought study the role of Jews in economic life.
They pioneered new retail institutions, from department stores to box stores.
Jews were spread across many countries, but to some extent shared a common language and a sense of common fate.
Societies long oriented to economic dynamism tend to welcome the economically successful, viewing them as a source of mutual gains.
Indeed, the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well-known risk factors for illness and death, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, high blood glucose, and high cholesterol.
After all, the brain is just one organ of the body, so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others’.
As adults, they tend to have better diets, exercise more, gain less weight, have fewer hangovers, and so on.
Researchers have also searched for clues about the intelligence-mortality link in specific types of death.
The ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer.
Moreover, German politicians rarely heed the advice of German economists.
But the contraction will be primarily because of declining exports, a large portion of which consists of investment goods, as well as the drop in domestic equipment investment.
Germany should prepare its economic stimulus program now and implement it when the time comes.
After all, aside from political under-representation, Germany’s annual contribution to the EU budget (most recently €7.4 billion) makes the country by far the largest net contributor.
So his recent exercise in speculative future history, which asks whether economic growth in the United States has come to an end, has attracted much favorable attention.

Together, these companies invented mail order as the “killer app” of the railroad age, creating a continental market for consumer goods, with all of the economies of scale that followed.
Decades of frustration are now yielding to success: the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called Big Data that the Internet simultaneously generates and captures.
And here, too, Gordon disappoints.
The eurozone aspires to full economic integration, which entails the elimination of transaction costs that impede cross-border commerce and finance.
No one even keeps track of, say, Florida’s current-account deficit with the rest of the country, although we can safely guess that it is huge (since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere).
Even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance, there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so.
If European leaders want to maintain democracy, they must make a choice between political union and economic disintegration.
It must capture the imagination, address the public’s anxieties, and generate realistic hope.
Europe, in particular, needs a narrative of long-term hope that will trigger a real recovery.
It can secure decent jobs and prosperity, with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2%.
This implies two-tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries: the “euro-ins” and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger Europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values.
Rather, the problem is that the benefits of growth have failed to trickle down to disaffected youth.
So far those masses have little to complain about.
Thus, China needs to move quickly on education reform.
Recent migrants from the countryside and graduates with degrees from second-tier universities sorely lack such connections.
Yes, globalization represents a challenge to all EU member states; but it is not clear how more integration would help them to confront it.
Economists long ago recognized that it is theoretically possible that the emergence of new growth poles abroad does more harm than good to an economy.
Moreover, this relatively good trade performance has been achieved with a much lower increase in wage inequality in Europe than in the US.
The claim that Europe needs more integration to save its social model has long lost credibility.
Federal assumption of the states’ war debts also yielded an advantage in terms of economic development: once states no longer had any debt, they had no need to raise any revenues through direct taxation, which might have impeded the growth of America’s internal market. Indeed, after the federal government assumed the states’ debt (already a small part of the total), state revenues fell by 80-90%.
By contrast, growth prospects in Europe today are rather dim, and interest payments, even for Greece or Italy, account for less than 20% of total revenues.
The bailout request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states (represented by the Senate) and the population (represented by the House of Representatives) under the normal decision-making procedure (the “Community method,” in European Union jargon).
The policy’s scope is also widely misunderstood.
US leaders are well aware of the geopolitical factors that make Europe their most important and reliable ally.
To this end, the EU can leverage its position as a leading trading partner, investor, and aid donor; it can also contribute at leaders’ summits, such as the Asia-Europe Meeting and the ASEAN Regional Forum.
The crucial issue is the extent to which creditors will have to participate in rescue measures by accepting “haircuts” – that is, partial losses on their claims.
But haircuts in the case of a solvency crisis are indispensable for the stability of the European financial system itself.
This level of protection would induce them to invest their money only if the borrowing country offered a reasonable, limited interest-rate premium over safe assets.
This mechanism is not available in a monetary union such as the eurozone.
In the United States, businesses and labor unions use “fair trade” laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls “barbed-wire barriers to imports.”
By the end of 2007, more than 600 producers’ organizations, representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries, were selling fair-trade products.
This has raised farm producers’ income independently of the fair-trade movement’s efforts.
This is without considering the effect that FAIRTRADE has on the poorest people in these countries – not farmers but casual laborers – who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards.
Is US Monetary Policy Made in China?
In 2005, US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan pointed to the phenomenon as an explanation for his famous “conundrum”: interest rates on Treasury bonds were lower than market conditions appeared to warrant.
His estimates imply that foreign sales at a rate of $60 billion per month raise yields by ten basis points.
Why Finance Can Save the Planet
In 2011, “Unburnable Carbon,” a path-breaking report by the nongovernmental Carbon Tracker Initiative, showed that the proven fossil-fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exceed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees Celsius.
A second reason why finance matters is that the transition to a low-carbon economy requires huge investments.
But, because high fuel prices are unpopular with consumers and raise competitiveness concerns among businesses, governments are reluctant to take action today – and may renege on their commitments to act tomorrow.
There would be no procrastination.
So, should governments step back and let financial firms reform themselves?
As a result, even if corporate governance problems in financial firms are fully addressed, a government role in regulating their compensation structures may still be warranted.
In such a case, firms could still remain free to choose the number of shares and options awarded to any given manager, as well as to adjust somewhat the length of the post-vesting period during which cashing out would be precluded. 
Consider the facts.
Indeed, the figures have been repeatedly revised, even over quite short periods of time, casting strong doubt on the validity of the economic models being used.
This may be true when the economy is operating at full employment – when state and market are in competition for every last resource.
This implies that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit – reluctance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market.
These are trying times for French President François Hollande.
For Islamic fundamentalists, France is now the “Great Satan.”
While the French public agrees that Mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists, the way Afghanistan did in the late 1990’s, attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades.
For Hollande, war in Mali is both an opportunity and a risk.
It is no less significant for Hollande and France.
Moreover, the capabilities of the Malian army and those of other West African countries that are supposed to join the operation are too weak to turn the tide.
To be sure, Europe has the means for joint action.
Britain’s bilateral cooperation with France – highlighted during the Libyan crisis – is sometimes very strong.
Now, however, it recoils at any prospect of military intervention, even as it remains the world’s third-largest arms exporter.
Two striking statements on economic policy by France’s leaders in the first weeks of this year have highlighted the force of this logic.
Not surprisingly, the preference has been for transfers, which, until the 2008 financial crash, took the form of cross-border private-sector lending to governments and banks.
From this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity, because this would boost economic growth, in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run.
The specter of continuing economic stagnation and ever-rising unemployment (with the young and older workers being the worst hit) should remove the second, geopolitical obstacle to a French exit from the eurozone.
For example, Arvind Panagariya of Columbia University divided developing countries into two groups: “miracle” countries that had annual per capita GDP growth rates of 3% or higher, and “debacle” countries that had negative or zero growth rates.
He has also shown that many of the nineteenth century’s successful high-tariff countries, such as Canada and Argentina, used tariffs as a revenue source, not as a means of sheltering domestic manufacturers.
The opposite is true.
That refrain is followed by a chorus from the rest of the monetary union demanding to know why Germany is taking such an inflexible approach.
To be sure, even Germans know that rules sometimes need to be bent. Thinkers as far back as Aristotle have argued that rules fail when they are too rigid.
The default of 1945 was the consequence of losing World War II. Indeed, the tradition of so-called Ordoliberalism that has shaped Germany’s post-war economic policy was a response to the Nazis’ destructive arbitrariness.
ATHENS – The centrality of Germany to Europe and, more widely, to world affairs has been amply, and often bloodily, demonstrated over many centuries.
And yet, despite the risks, European leaders remain remarkably inactive, apparently reassured by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to protect the monetary union from collapse. But prolonged inaction, induced by relative calm in financial markets, will perpetuate stagnation and eventually lead to a breakup of one sort or another.
Austerity should be eased, particularly in the fiscally stronger core economies, and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in the over-indebted countries.
There is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982.
When the European Union was created, it was the embodiment of an open society – a voluntary association of equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good.
But the periphery is seething with discontent.
If the euro breaks up in disarray, the common market and the EU will be destroyed, leaving Europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began, owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility.
The same result could be achieved, with less cost to Germany, if Germany chose to behave as a benevolent hegemon.
But, whatever form the default takes, the current owners of Greek debt will get less than the full amount that they are now owed.
There simply is no way around the arithmetic implied by the scale of deficit reduction and the accompanying economic decline: Greece’s default on its debt is inevitable.
The substantial surge in the interest rate on Greek bonds relative to German bonds in the past few weeks shows that the market now regards such a default as increasingly likely.
Now, 15 months into the expansion, the level of real GDP is still lower than it was when the recession started.
When those price bubbles burst, households lost substantial wealth and financial markets became dysfunctional.
But it is worth remembering that the saving rate averaged 9% in the quarter-century from 1960 to 1985.
Now those projections have been cut to less than 2%, which is too slow to make a dent in the very high rate of unemployment.
“Reform” suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life, undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism, as an antidote to Mao Zedong’s ideology of “revolution.”
Little in China today speaks of moderation.
After all, Mao’s Cultural Revolution against “feudal society” did raze much of the cultural landscape, denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions, but also of failed socialist efforts, leaving China ready for the seeds of capitalist development.
The first wrong Chinese was Gao Xingjian, a critical playwright, artist, and novelist, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000, while living in exile in Paris.
As the warm welcome given to Hillary Clinton on her recent swing through Asia – even in communist Vietnam – appears to show, Southeast Asians are more than happy to hang on to Pax Americana for a bit longer, out of fear of China.
Communist ideology is a spent force.
Democracy has not tempered South Korean chauvinism much, either, since the demise of the military dictatorship in the 1980’s.
The urban disturbances in France have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968.
The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity, religion, and even social class.
France is now very bad at creating new jobs.
One study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants, those with an Islamic-sounding name, and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb, had only one-fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French-sounding name and a “safe” address.
Similar sentiments are all but universal among modern physicists.
You can write the equations of the core theories of physics – known as the standard model – quite comfortably on a T-shirt.
The answer likely lies within us.
Viewed from this perspective, the apparent beauty of the laws of physics – our attraction to their symmetry and exuberance – is not surprising.
Rather than recognizing the beauty of laws otherwise discovered, we use principles of beauty – vast symmetry and a high ratio of output to input – to enable discovery.
Virginia Woolf called the ideal of womanhood in this period “The Angel in the House”: a retiring, fragile creature who could not withstand the rigors of the public arena.
My alma mater, Yale, used anonymity in reporting of sex harassment and rape to sweep sex-crime incidents and repeat offenders’ records under the rug for two decades, thereby protecting its own interest in preventing systematic investigation.
And we have the myth of higher false reporting of rape relative to other crimes (in the US, the rate is no different: 2-4%).
It is no one’s business whom a victim has slept with previously, or what she was wearing when she was attacked.
The interest-rate spreads for Italian and Spanish government bonds have dropped dramatically, corporate-bond issues have resumed, and a sense of normalcy is slowly pervading the continent.
By the time the German Bundestag decided, it could be too late.
But why is Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who is not an elected politician (and has promised not to run for election), so hesitant? Given that he does not have to fear electoral defeat, he could help Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy by filing first, which would weaken the political stigma for Rajoy’s government were it to file subsequently.
While Monti’s mandate was set to last until the election, he might be trying to extend it with the support of the new parliament.
Given that France overcame similar weaknesses and political deadlock with the creation of the Fifth Republic, which includes a robust executive led by a powerful president, the French model seems like an effective one to follow.
The right-wing RPR-UDF coalition did even better in 1993, when it won 38.5% of the vote in the first round but obtained an astonishing 82% of the seats.
At the end of the day, there is no institutional reform that could miraculously “save” Italy.
For example, when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases, it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities, because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations.
Lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished.
Saddled by a viral infection, drug-related insecurity, and rising crime, Mexico feels like a besieged place.
That is why home seems far, far away for so many Mexicans.
Against the backdrop of rapid globalization, the individual risks and costs of moving internationally will continue to fall.
Approximately 200 million people, around 3% of the world’s population, now live in countries in which they were not born.
As education levels rise, so do expectations about work.
Opening borders completely could produce gains as high as $39 trillion for the world economy over 25 years.
Occasional frustrations notwithstanding, it is, in fact, unlikely that the US will turn against a faithful – and dependent – ally, especially one whose leader enjoys cordial personal relations with Bush.
Obaidullah’s capture – carried out reluctantly – underscores the Pakistan military’s ambiguous relationship with the Taliban.
This is clear in Islamabad, where over the past two months, Kalashnikov-toting students have openly challenged the state, following a government order for the demolition of dozens of illegally built mosques and seminaries.
Hardline Islamists, favored previously, are now out, and soldiers charged with mutiny have received the death penalty.
It is unresolved because the scientific question has always been entangled with politics.
Society would be spending scarce resources on losers rather than winners.
The evolutionary story was now recast as a battle of genes to secure their survival over time by means of mutations, which create individuals (phenotypes) best adapted to pass on their genes.
Consideration for others is “located in the prefrontal cortex.”
Obama’s Rocky Path to Success in Syria
There simply was not enough hard evidence of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, at least before the Ghouta massacre in August, to pressure Russia – either in the United Nations Security Council or the court of global opinion – to reconsider its reflex support of the regime.
And the administration could have helped itself by better explaining that a cooperative response to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons had long been on the table, and was not just the result of deftly opportunistic Russian diplomacy in response to a Kerry thought-bubble.
And that outcome is not possible without Iran.
In December 2012, Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons, including sarin gas, being transferred to Syria.
America’s regional position weakened, and Iran’s strengthened, following the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq; US intervention in Syria could reproduce that pattern.
This, in turn, would strengthen the Russia-Iran alliance.
Obama has his “red line” on the use of chemical weapons. So does Khamenei.
If the market price rises above that figure, the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher.
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children.
Why Put Charles Taylor on Trial
Both our home government and friends in Sierra Leone agreed.
When we tried to escape, the rebels captured us.
They then cut off David's arms before setting him ablaze.
Russia’s conflict with the Islamic State, the argument goes, has aligned the country’s interests with those of the West.
Ordinary Russians may be in danger of attacks by Islamic extremists, but they pose little threat to Putin or his allies.
Putin’s Russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum, while the United States and Europe (despite the protests of civil libertarians) have chosen to occupy the other end.
Hard to be Easing
Moreover, fiscal support is absent this time: QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip, respectively, because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus.
Indeed, the bond-market channel is unlikely to boost growth.
Empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker US dollar on the trade balance is close to zero.
NEW HAVEN – The politicization of central banking continues unabated.
The reason is not hard to fathom.
Not only is QE’s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn, balance-sheet-constrained economies limited; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy.
Household debt stood at 112% of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record highs in 2006, but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75% norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century.
Where it goes, the next crisis is inevitably doomed to follow.
In fact, Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end.
Japan’s military thrust into Southeast Asia led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s administration to impose sanctions.
On December 1, it was decided that the war would commence in six days.
However, high-handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response, for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated, and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice.
Romney’s proposed contractionary policies –&nbsp;the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely, while the US economy is still frail –&nbsp;will almost surely weaken America’s already anemic growth, and, if the euro crisis worsens, it could bring on another recession.
Indeed, the model blew up even before Bush left office.
Consider, for example, the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier: climate change, financial regulation, and trade.
A stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the US from China to lower-cost producers of textiles, apparel, and other goods.
Of course, Scotland’s technocratic nationalism made sense.
In fact, the “no” campaign’s victory might have been even more resounding if the Westminster establishment’s desperate, last-minute offer to grant Scotland more powers on taxation, spending, and welfare had been included as an option in the ballot.
True, Scotland’s great minds in the age of Enlightenment, such as David Hume, Adam Smith, and even the national poet, Robert Burns, were all fervent advocates of “Britishness,” whatever that might mean today. Yet an identity-based campaign could have resorted to the heritage of the Scottish Renaissance of the mid-twentieth century or to the Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight movements, which awakened a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots in the late nineteenth century.
Long Live China’s Slowdown
That number has potentially huge implications, because it means that China could grow at an annual rate in the 7-8% range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction.
Yet services offer more than just a labor-intensive growth path.
Invariably, the middle-income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early-stage development models for too long.
Who will then fund America’s budget deficit – and on what terms?
How can this be?
John Maynard Keynes, however, had little time for this view.
The financial reaction to the collapse of a bubble and the resulting wave of bankruptcies drives the natural rate of interest below zero, even though there are still many ways to put people productively to work.
MILAN – Until recently, relatively little attention was paid to states’ balance sheets.
Of course, state ownership is not the only way to impede efficiency and dynamism.
States own land, mineral rights, and infrastructure.
Here is the dilemma: Governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act, but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism.
The alternative is a poor intergenerational burden-sharing choice.
In fact, those concerned about labor rights and the environment risked hurting their own cause.
The agreement includes substantial steps to enforce the prohibitions contained in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
There was, of course, a danger that such protections for corporations could go too far.
In all these areas and more, traditional textbook arguments about the gains from trade apply: new export opportunities lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living.
In response, US President Barack Obama’s administration has been working through the United Nations Security Council to impose tougher economic sanctions.  Nonetheless, Iran edges toward mastering the process of enriching uranium to weapons-grade purity.
Accordingly, if tougher sanctions prove to be useful, they will do so by confronting Iran with a united diplomatic front, thereby encouraging its government to make a deal in order to end the country’s isolation.
In response to an attack, Iran might well seek to obstruct shipping in the Persian Gulf, potentially triggering oil shortages and soaring prices.
Dialogue with the US could focus on areas, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where the two parties share a measure of common ground.
Credit mistakes are made during the boom, not during the crash, so the argument goes.
Small failures can give birth to large panics, which means that in a crisis almost everyone is “too big to fail.”
Those that failed were relatively small, like IKB, Bear Sterns, and so on.
Let’s not forget the essays in central banks’ stability reports on how credit derivatives were benefiting the financial sector.
Europe’s Non-Deal of the Century
One of the most powerful arguments for the EADS-BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market, while also creating a powerful new defense industry.
Mario Draghi’s Opiate of the Markets
And they regard this outcome as the worst-case scenario, one that implies a delay of any further economic measures, deep policy uncertainty, and the risk of an even less favorable electoral outcome.
For this reason, triggering the OMT mechanism requires the unanimous consent of eurozone governments.
Even after Germany’s election, I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives – and even the composition – of Italy’s ruling coalition.
There are many reasons for these gyrations, but the expectation that the Fed will start to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as September – is clearly one of them.
Some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors, which have reduced the labor force, as well as to weak productivity levels, which have been low.
Estimates from Citigroup indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrupted in the coming decades.
The direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods.
If the Fed is seen as unleashing a major crisis in emerging markets, this will almost certainly do long-term damage to the global financial system.
And without structural reform, there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay.
Back in 2013, IMF staff wrote a sobering report on the organization’s experience in the country.
Breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers (as they do in much of southern Europe, including Italy and, to some extent, France) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers. Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier.
In an ideal world, offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state.
These six international banks alone accounted for nearly 20% of the prime money-market funds’ value.
The proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money-market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value “float” – and not be rounded up – to reflect its true, underlying risk.
But the 2008 financial crisis showed that, when push comes to shove, the government will backstop money-market funds nonetheless.
So the mutual-fund industry had the regulators all to itself.
Given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms, America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order.
The US and the EU (taken as a whole) are not only the world’s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies; they also maintain the world’s largest bilateral trade relationship.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement spearheaded by the US, is set to be a game-changer in the Asia-Pacific region, with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015.
But let’s not wait: faced with predictions of the West’s relative decline, the US and the EU must commit themselves to more union, more cooperation, and more prosperity.
At the same time, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has become a bastion of sensible thinking on financial-sector issues.
But what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time?
Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig’s The Bankers’ New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it? will appear officially in March, but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks.
Whatever else happens in 2013, we can be sure that they will not win the Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award.
On the unification of Germany, he resisted the advice of Thatcher and others, apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Other critics complained that Bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding Russian democracy, the Middle East, or nuclear non-proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid.
He was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev, and to manage the transition to Boris Yeltsin’s presidency in a newly independent Russia.
The lesson is that in some circumstances, we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like George H. W. Bush (or Dwight Eisenhower before him), rather than by more flashy and inspirational transformers.
But, for several reasons, the Turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small-scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all-out war.
That’s hardball politics, not a declaration of war.
It can close the two countries’ principal border crossing, an important route for food, fuel, and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds.
Most supplies headed for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the Incirlik airbase in Turkey.
The outcome of this standoff could determine Ukraine’s future, as much as the military confrontation with Russia.
Russia’s intervention has to some extent backfired, strengthening support for a European orientation.
The energy monopoly Naftogaz, previously a cesspool of illicit transactions, has in a year managed the seemingly impossible: making Ukraine virtually independent from direct gas delivery from Russia for at least a year.
Infrastructure Minister Andriy Pivovarsky, also a former investment banker, was most recently CEO of Continium, one of the country’s largest holding companies.
The stakes could not be higher.
The US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves, but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth.
Indeed, almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of QE, more than 95%, are sitting in excess reserves, neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation.
The new Consumer Financial Protection Board is also a deterrent, as banks consider it safer to lend to the government, large corporations, and giant real-estate speculators.
It will take a clearly stated, widely understood strategy – the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979-1982 – to complete the job.
There are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial-market participants would rather forget.
Our national politicians, increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises, are suspected, often with good reason, of simply looking after their own interests.
In the Anglo-Saxon media world, Rupert Murdoch, owner of far too many newspapers, TV stations, and movie studios, is a typical populist tycoon.
A few years ago, a clown named Brozo, with a large red nose and a bright green wig, was Mexico’s most popular political commentator on television, actively courted by all candidates running for national office.
They are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views.
Their main interest is in their own business.
NEW YORK – The sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle.
Lifestyle changes, for example, have spurred increasing per capita water consumption, with rising incomes promoting dietary change, for example, especially higher consumption of meat, production of which is ten times more water-intensive, on average, than plant-based calories and proteins.
China, however, is not yet in the category of water-stressed states.
With the era of cheap, bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints, many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil.
But recently, a fifth element, information, has entered the debate.
Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring, an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature.
For example, those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier, more vibrant, and more attractive than those who do not.
But mimicry’s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz.
Such tools can be used to comprehend, for example, the difference between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama.
In “House of Cards,” the world is not as viewers believe it should be, but as they fear it is.
The series has become known not just for its massive budget or intricate storytelling, but also for its sustained choreography of brutal violence.
They relish the reminder that politics is just as ruthless in the US as it is at home.
Many of the links were obvious, but had been given insufficient attention.
The Bank’s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state, and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government.
Worse, the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance, an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies, thereby enervating their effectiveness.
He has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up.
Such arguments also ignore the fact that affluent working women and their partners overwhelmingly offload the work-family imbalance onto lower-income women – overwhelmingly women of color.
This solution was not framed as a “women’s issue,” but as a family benefit.
Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40% female board membership.
After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as well as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions – no matter how much “soft pressure” is put upon them.
Indeed, the critics point out that the wide-ranging and comprehensive talks agreed to by the two sides are the old “composite dialogue” under a new label.
The transcendent reality of life on the subcontinent is that it has always been India that wished to live in peace.
And, should it prove necessary, dialogue can also be used to send a few tough signals.
NEW YORK – Long ago, I wrote about the Internet pioneer Julf Helsingius, who ran a precursor to WikiLeaks called anon.penet.fi.
He was opaque and playfully cryptic, already a little paranoid – perhaps justifiably so.
If institutions are not fully accountable, it is useful to have an unaccountable countervailing institution to reveal their secrets.
If the cure is to be worse than the disease, to quote Personal Democracy Forum co-founder Andrew Rasiej, let’s find a better cure: let’s make the proper distinction between what should be secret and what everyone knows.
Information – and specifically the Internet’s power to spread it – is our best defense against bad, unaccountable behavior.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange argues that the answer is no, and that greater transparency “creates a better society for all people.”
Avoiding embarrassment may at times be in the national interest, but it can also protect the careers of politicians and bureaucrats.
Perversely, it will lead to greater secrecy.
This model, within which individuals are subjects or, at best, taxpayers and voters, is being undermined by several recent trends that have empowered the individual.
Global finance has been one of the most eager beneficiaries of these trends, using Internet networks not just as a tool to conduct operations with greater efficiency and velocity, but also as a means to circumvent state supervision.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for circulating on the Internet his proposal for a truly democratic constitution, Charter 08, which gathered 10,000 signatures online in only 24 hours.
That storm will leave behind no trace of understanding if it is assessed in isolation, rather than as part of a broader pattern.
Contagion soon spread across East Asia, with the ripple effects of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as Russia and Brazil.
Since then, China has aggressively pursued a fast-growth, export, and investment heavy model of economic development.

Europe’s Unending Berlusconi Problem
But the overall picture remains fragile.
While the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition, many uncertainties could derail the reform process.
Will Cap-and-Trade Incite Protectionism?
That uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements, such as automobile mileage standards, production technology standards (e.g., minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation), etc.
When the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions, there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices. Such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products (being higher on more CO2-intensive products) and among countries (being higher for countries with low permit prices).
But as China’s leaders begin final preparations for the Games next August, they may be wondering if hosting the event was such a good idea after all.
Television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide Beijing with the signature Olympic image it had in mind, and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage.
China’s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes, but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics.
As China’s leaders scramble to address these challenges, will they still relish the idea of providing an international audience with front-row seats? How they look back on the Games once the confetti is swept from the streets is far from certain.
But China’s history of humiliation at the hands of European colonial powers has made its leaders ardent supporters of inviolable national rights and suspicious of any sacrifice of sovereignty.

Today, the country is a remarkable economic power: the world’s manufacturing workshop, its foremost financier, a leading investor across the globe from Africa to Latin America, and, increasingly, a major source of research and development.
All of which raises the question of whether China will eventually replace the US as the world’s hegemon, the global economy’s rule setter and enforcer.
Gone will be the evangelism of markets and democracy.
The trouble is that it will become increasingly difficult for China to maintain the kind of growth that it has experienced in recent years.
Will China’s Capitalist Revolution Turn Democratic
Nearly all the major institutional reforms, such as strengthening the legislature, holding village elections, and building a modern legal system, were launched in the 1980’s.
Having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co-opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders, the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base.
At the same time, selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily.
This imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity, analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity, when computers replace human intelligence.
Indeed, according to a computer crunching big data, this would be an optimal decision.
In this context, it is difficult not to think of China’s recent stock-market plunge.
These people influence markets, because all other investors must reckon with them; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon.
Optimists – fortunately, there remain a few, especially in Europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical, political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth, job creation, and financial stability.
Left to its own devices, such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering, disruptive posturing, and disagreement over visions of the future.
For them, only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and, instead, catalyze the policy initiatives – greater fiscal, banking, and political union – that, together with monetary union, would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four-legged platform.
And global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves, shifting countries’ liabilities to taxpayers and the ECB’s balance sheet.
So the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety. It also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome.
Europe’s banking system remains sickly, even though many national governments have gone to great lengths to hide their banks’ woes.
It is just as important to ask what happens over the next five years as over the next six months, and the jury is still very much out on that.
If reform resumes, there is no reason why Europe should not enjoy a decade of per capita income growth at least as high as that of the US.
Portugal did so in 2001 and the Netherlands in 2003.
The reform proposals that are currently being debated are adventurous to say the least, because they all seem to center around the question of which government expenses should be exempt from the calculation of the deficit.
Europe is, moreover, the continent with the slowest rate of economic growth in the world.
Will Ex-Mexicans Choose America’s Next President?
The first American immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 – the so-called Gentleman’s Agreement with Japan, while the US and Mexico negotiated and administered the Bracero Program for more than twenty years, from 1942 thru 1964.
The electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation’s importance in today’s presidential campaigns.
The other, already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high-savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East.
But once American households rebuild their retirement accounts, they may return to their profligate ways.
They need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging Chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving.
One development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money-losing proposition.
Today, one might ask the same question about the global economy’s vulnerability to cyber-attack.
They say that the ability of cyber-terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink, as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4, is utterly fictional.
Third, with slowing growth in advanced economies, information technology seems to hold the moral high ground, just as finance did until five years ago.
If the world’s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses, what guarantee is there that something won’t go awry?
Over the past few decades, the International Monetary Fund became associated with excessive fiscal austerity, extreme political insensitivity, and – since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 – with an out-and-out stigma.
Greek trade unions know what this means – and are in the streets.
T he IMF was created in the waning days of World War II, essentially as a United States-West European partnership.
We can expect to hear all kinds of misleading excuses from EU sources for excluding the IMF: “the Fund is too American,” “Europe must resolve its own problems,” and “the IMF is not appropriate to our circumstances.”
The end game – for both Israel and Hamas – is thus crucially important.
With open borders, Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank, putting enormous pressure on Abbas, the leader of the rival Fatah movement, to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas.
Palestinians will recognize Hamas’s acceptance of a multi-year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat, which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment.
More importantly, Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war, sharing Palestinian suffering; many have been killed, along with their families.
The region’s economic stature was bolstered in 2003 with the advent of the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, a $4.2 billion project brokered by the World Bank that is expected to boost exploration and output in Chad and at offshore sites in Equatorial Guinea, while spreading the benefits more widely.
For this reason, the World Bank imposed stringent conditions on Chad and Cameroon.
This constitutes a powerful disincentive for Chad and Cameroon to act against company malfeasance or to defend individuals adversely affected by the project.
PARIS &#45;&#45; Few state visits have lasting results.
Sarkozy’s strategy is to link progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a redefinition of NATO.
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even tried to use divide-and-rule tactics by pitting “New” Europe against the “Old” Europe led by France and Germany, which opposed the Iraq war.
LONDON – When Mark Carney replaces Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England in July 2013, the world will be deprived of King’s witty public utterances.
Regulators have been wrestling with this problem for years, without conspicuous success.
They will also be required to maintain stronger capital and liquidity positions in the US.
He adds: “I wouldn’t call it a trade war, but I would certainly call it a high level of protectionism.”
“Be careful what you wish for” is wise advice in the regulatory world, as it is elsewhere.
The government’s incentives are clear.
In this cat-and-mouse game, risk takers have the upper hand.
For example, the US Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble, ultra-low interest rates will be maintained (at the expense of savers) until the sector recovers.
Finally, the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net.
For most Israelis, even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon’s legacy after the Gaza disengagement, Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister.
Halutz already resigned a few months ago.
Only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed.
What will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes?
Does that experience suggest that the NASDAQ index will drop sharply if the Fed raises interest rates on June 30?
If one borrows the equivalent of three years' income to buy a house, a mortgage rate of 6% means that 18% of one's income goes to interest payments, which may be tolerable.
Low interest rates did not cause the bubbles.
Of course, Russia partly belongs to this region.
Russians, on the other hand, emphasize their “hard power,” including military force, because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind.
Thus, the old mentality survived on both sides.
Without Russia, which will remain the world’s third strongest power for the foreseeable future, it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security.
I love this guy.”
Brazil’s current success is rooted not only in Lula’s two terms, which must end in 2010.
And Lula achieved all this without triggering inflation, which he knows – perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood – wreaks havoc on the poor most of all.
If Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path, it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures.
Meanwhile, the advanced economies are tentatively recovering from the 2008 crisis.
Second, emerging-market bears point out that these economies have gained major productivity benefits from the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas, a surplus that will soon be exhausted.
And coding-supported products often have lower costs per unit of output than even very cheap labor can provide.
In fact, it could be argued that new “leap-frogging” may become possible.
Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life.
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture.
On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.
The main impediment to further progress is that two competing narratives have emerged to explain Europe’s economic travails and lay out a path forward.
While an integrated financial framework for Europe is taking shape, daunting decisions regarding the design of a European resolution mechanism need to be worked out.
Although politicians and voters are equally unwilling to admit it, the EU has reached a fork in the road.
American financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles Britain’s position in world finance a century ago.
Despite the dollar’s instant credibility, however, it took more than a decade for America’s currency to match Britain’s as an international medium of exchange. Payment habits melt at a glacier’s pace.
The European Central Bank, established in 1998, has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability.
A catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange.
The primary problem is that conditions in individual EMU members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be tempted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members.
Although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus, a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants.
But even if it is one of the smaller countries, it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end.
European officials’ incensed reaction – the banks are fine, they insist, and need only liquidity support – should serve to buttress the Fund’s determination to be sensible about Europe.
My own sarcastic reaction was to think, “Oh, now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk.”
That is why, for example, so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner.
Now that the Fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many European banks, it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis, a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform.
More than a decade after the fact, the Kremlin still decries NATO’s eastward enlargement as a security threat.
Yet this is not in the group interests of Putin’s backers, the people who run, and own, Russia: its security, military, and industrial complex.
The St. Petersburg Economic Forum is mostly for international consumption.
In his decade in power, Putin has consolidated and strengthened the security forces, intimidated and jailed opponents, and muzzled the media and courts.
Arab democracy, he claims, has now become a domestic concern in the United States, which will make it hard for American presidents to sweep the abuses of friendly Arab regimes under the rug, as they did in the past.
They have even inspired the birth of a new political party, Hizb al ghad (the Party of Tomorrow), founded by a young parliamentarian committed to democratic reform.
The NDP appears to believe that democratization must begin with changing the political culture and instilling democratic values.
City employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25.5 Celsius).
It is already having harmful consequences for others, and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change, while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs.
Overwhelmingly, the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt, to find alternative sources of food, and who do not have access to health care.
Camilla Toulmin, who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development, a London-based NGO, was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June.
So what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows?
On the downside, confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit, mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages.
Almost 30% expected to recover by the summer, and the remaining 10% foresaw normal operations after the autumn.
The disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration.
On November 4-5, the fourth Summit of the Americas took place in Mar del Plata, Argentina.
Unfortunately, the lack of progress on trade-related issues is not the only burden on relations between the US and Latin America.
Second, immigration reform in the US should be enacted in a way that protects the rights of Latino migrants.
This is not happening, because bond traders cannot imagine that the Republicans would be able – or even willing – to follow through.
Countries never default because they can’t pay their debts; there are always ways to decrease expenditures or raise taxes.
Symbolic gestures are to be expected, as with the threatened government shutdown earlier this year, which merely created fodder for political advertising by both parties.
Some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded.
Rather, it depends on a combination of capability and credibility.
First, China poses a potential threat, whereas Japan does not.
Third, the US-Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests, such as pandemics, terrorism, and human outflows from failed states.
Even so, the elections may check President Viktor Yanukovych’s power.
But the opposition, which comprises half the country, is badly demoralized after five years of stalemate among the Orange Revolution’s leaders, for which the largest share of blame falls on former President Viktor Yushchenko, who by almost all accounts has betrayed the democratic breakthrough that he represented.
Unlike Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yanukovych seems to have steamrolled too many too fast, overestimating his power and narrowing his base.
Their most vocal public representatives are First Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy and the economy minister, Petro Poroshenko, who was a major force behind the Orange Revolution.
But it is a lapsed democratic country. They must help to change that.
As a result, the possibility of achieving a common understanding of the act is being lost – and, with it, whatever potential there may be for meaningful cooperation.
While the full details of the attack on MH17 remain unknown, shooting a surface-to-air missile at a civilian airliner flying over a war zone is most likely a violation of the law of war – by which the Ukrainian government, the Russian government, and the rebels are all bound.
And, perhaps more important, doing so can play a key role in securing the political, diplomatic, and legal support needed to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Recent history explains this re-concentration of power.
The somnolent Hu/Wen era, fortunately, did not dampen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms undertaken by Jiang and Zhu.
And it announced its intention to slow local governments’ seizures of farmland and excessive borrowing through captive enterprises.
Previously, the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark; and the party’s foreign-affairs office, which handled North Korea, often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry, which handled South Korea.
This is desperation migration.
Unsurprisingly, migrant women are often victims of human trafficking, finding themselves enslaved as laborers, prostitutes, or participants in organized begging operations.
Moreover, social integration in a new country can be more difficult for women than for men.
Renminbi Rising?
Relative economic strength explains why the Japanese yen failed to develop into an IVC, and why Tokyo – whose financial markets satisfied the relevant requirements – failed to become a 1-IFC.
In fact, effective financial-monitoring and prudential-regulation systems do not have to precede opening the capital account.
While the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade, 9/11 was the turning point. Five years into this new era, how should we characterize it?
Then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support.
Jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins.
In the aftermath of 9/11, there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America’s military response against the Taliban.
The first two were forced upon the US, but the third was the result of a willful, deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush, taken on ideological grounds and, most likely, for personal reasons as well.
With Saddam gone, Iraq’s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war, leaving Iraq’s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy.
They have a point: with the Shia in power in Iraq, Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims.
This, too, is a result brought about by the American neocon masterminds.
People everywhere, consumers and investors alike, are canceling spending plans, because the world economy seems very risky right now.
Confidence isn’t built up on the basis of spending or lending alone.
After years of privation (and in many countries the physical destruction of war), people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild, own a home, a car, and other consumer goods.
She concluded that the positive effect of “pent-up demand” and government measures can “make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy.”
Seemingly peripheral issues, like aid to the developing world and the poor, who suffer the most from a crisis like this one, will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence, just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II.
But there is an important caveat, which has largely been ignored in public discussions: if this funding is senior to private debt (as IMF funding typically is), it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets.
The bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by loss-bearing capacity.
So a final element of the package ought to be a monitored pledge by eurozone banks that they will not unload bonds as the official sector steps in; that they will raise capital over time instead of continuing to deleverage (if this hurts bank equity holders, they should think of this as burden sharing); and that they will be circumspect about banker bonuses until economies start growing strongly again.
Peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops, and the arrival of jobs, productive farms and factories, tourism, health care, and schools.
Crony businesses from the US and Europe, which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions, squander time, aid funds, and opportunities.
In the fourth phase, which can last a generation or more, assistance is directed to long-term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts.
This type of aid does not require long studies, but quick action.
Only by taking quick, meaningful action to fight hunger, poverty, and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace.
You do not win people over by bombing them, but by helping them.
As a way to address this dilemma, the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan, which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process.
Only then could a new, long-term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war, and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented.
The topic is too broad to be discussed solely among governments and secret services.
We Europeans need to be self-critical and admit that we are not only lagging behind in terms of technical capabilities; we are also in danger of not fully grasping in time the possibilities and dangers of the digital world.
However, without domestic pressure, little will change.
This weekend in Munich, the Schmidts and Kissingers of today and tomorrow will have an opportunity to engage in what is probably the most important strategic debate of our time: how to prevent the West from falling apart in
Instead, his claim to fame was his role as architect of America’s failed war in Iraq.
Europe does not get in America’s way because it wants to maintain Europe’s equally out-dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank’s sister institution.
Perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK’s next prime minister, he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change.
Women and Development
An obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately.
Covering every eligible girl in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $6 billion.
Other tools, aside from schooling, can help women improve their income-earning ability.
Being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life.
McCain’s selection of Palin was an attempt to appeal to these mothers and to pick up votes from women disappointed about Clinton’s loss.
At first glance, it seems reasonable that political parties might be able to translate women’s gender consciousness into a unified voting bloc.
Those who can or must support themselves outside marriage tend to favor expanding economic opportunities for women and to oppose laws and values that give familial authority to husbands and fathers.
Palin’s nomination, however, could have an unintended consequence on the gender views of social conservatives.
What does it mean to be Danish, German, or French in the presence of these millions of newcomers, most of whom come from non-democratic societies?
The program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one-to-one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Danish society.
I am often struck by the way many Europeans use arms-length euphemisms when talking about immigrants: they want immigrants to feel “welcome” or “comfortable.”
More than once, I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions.
In Tunisia, the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-seat Constituent Assembly.
Likewise, in Egypt, women protesters face greater scrutiny than men.
They must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence.
They all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism.
Likewise, the leader of Britain’s Conservatives, David Cameron, startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “need, above all, love.” When Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the “flyweight” Cameron would be carried out and the “heavyweight” Brown victorious after a short bout, he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons, but the remark went down badly with voters.
It took decades to become real, and there are still countries that have a long way to go.
Whatever the particular values of leading candidates, this is undoubtedly progress.
Looking healthy, fit, youthful, and professional are now signs that male elites use to signal their status to one another in an advanced consumer and corporate economy.
This continual, rather fetishistic sexualizing of powerful women confirms the argument I made more than two decades ago in my book The Beauty Myth: Women’s appearance is used against them most rigorously – as a diversionary tactic – when real social, economic, or political power is at stake and almost within their grasp.
But, because the media play a major role in perpetuating this double standard against women in the public eye, legislating or litigating against this kind of workplace harassment will not help.
Only the public sector, where the membership rate is 35%, has remained a union bastion. One of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike-happy Canada.
Teachers’ unions, especially, are a catastrophe, blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries’ education systems.
For rich countries, income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system, rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions.
The outlook for developing countries, in particular, is decidedly mixed.
This was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up.
Labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy: The same or higher quantity of steel, cars, and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers.
The transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions, employment protections, and norms of pay equity, greatly weakening workers’ bargaining power and job security.
Second, the forces of globalization and technological progress have combined to alter the nature of manufacturing work in a way that makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to emulate the industrialization experience of the Four Asian Tigers, or the European and North American economies before them.

Some schools are already becoming learning labs for sustainable development, where young students are being prepared to adapt to and help mitigate the consequences of climate change.
The Return of Currency Wars
In the eurozone, a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed, with Germany’s backing, by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the ECB have been a massive impediment to growth.
Of course, monetary easing is not purely zero-sum.
Unfortunately, the political economy of austerity has led to sub-optimal outcomes.
The world seems to be undergoing fundamental change: new actors are emerging on the world stage, previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied, and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors.
Its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate, in which “the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations becomes null” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory.
As Marcel Proust noted: “Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were.”
But, rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia, we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them.
The US at the time did not seem to understand that a multipolar world order was emerging – one that would make it very difficult to pursue, without serious consequences, the policies that Bush and Clinton had discussed in 2000. In a 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin made this plain, vehemently rejecting the intervention in Iraq and especially US plans to expand antimissile defense systems to Europe, calling this an act of aggression toward Russia and a breach of common European security.
China then took matters into its own hands, spearheading the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.
Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced.
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions.
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious.
In comparison, 13% of all Third World deaths result from water and air pollution.
But seriously, why do well-meaning First Worlders think that the Third World should have energy technologies that are more expensive, feebler, and less reliable than their own?
Africa needs to boost its yields, and that means enabling farmers to use modern crops, fertilizers, and pesticides.
Rather than pandering to advanced countries’ obsessions, Rio+20 could do more good for humanity – and the planet – by focusing on the top environmental problems and their simple solutions.
Critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the West today with the Germans who invaded Russia in 1941, while painting Ukrainian government officials as “fascists” and “neo-Nazis.”
Without defending Stalin, one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the Allied victory in WWII.
The parallels with Putin’s Russia are clear.
BEIJING – On November 15 Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the CCP’s Central Military Commission, giving him supreme authority over China’s armed forces.
China opened itself to the world in 1978, when Xi and his contemporaries were young men eager to understand the world outside China.
“The Pacific Ocean is wide enough to accommodate the two major countries of China and the US,” he declared.
Thus, he is willing to show diplomatic muscle if China is challenged on a core area of concern.
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Ruling elites almost everywhere – whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes – believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power.
Official corruption escalated.
After a decade of government by slogan, the Chinese public wants substance.
In an economy where several sectors are still shackled by pervasive regulations and controls, the payment of bribes in exchange for government permits can sometimes restore some semblance of a free market.
Two distinguishing features of the Chinese economy help to explain why it has seemed able to swim successfully against the current.
But, as China has grown into a more internationally integrated, modern economy, pervasive corruption has become more harmful than beneficial.
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle, home to many of the world’s leading technology firms, most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama.
To maintain his domestic image as a strong leader, he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies.
For China, the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty (BIT).
Facing enormous domestic pressure, Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi.
But, until now, the “right” to work at home was sacrosanct at Yahoo!, something that an employee’s manager could not overrule.
Cafeteria (now more inviting and more frequented with the advent of free food), or the halls of the Plug &amp; Play startup accelerator, proximity matters.
Personally, I come at this from the opposite direction.
Sixteen graduate and undergraduate students, male and female, felt that the university’s administration then did little to push back against such encroachments on female students’ rights to a fair and non-threatening learning environment.
Indeed, in the course of trying to report to the university in 2004 what had happened to me in 1983, I found the same pattern of stonewalling victims and defending perpetrators.
I know that one undergraduate has more recently pursued legal action against a staff member, who, she said, drugged her with Rohypnol, the “date rape” drug, and assaulted her.
Yale alumnae are reportedly now contacting these 16 students with their own stories of sexual assault and harassment, spanning two decades.
For, instead of infrastructure plans, commercial or environmental treaties, or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty, the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new US-Colombian military agreement, announced less than a month before the summit.
But her words did little soothing.
Another unexpected consequence of the US-Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia.
Unemployment in the eurozone as a whole averages about 12%, compared to more than 25% in Spain and Greece (where youth unemployment now stands at 60%).
In fact, by maintaining large trade surpluses, Germany is exporting unemployment and recession to its weaker neighbors.
Two outcomes now seem possible.
Europe’s north-south divide has become a time bomb lying at the foundations of the currency union.
The average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright.
Instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish.
They should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector, which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy, but also to people’s lives, with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment.
In fact, in the first half of this year, services accounted for more than half of total economic growth.
The share of working-age people (16-65 years old) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72%.
In other words, young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement.
By next year, Chinese R&amp;D expenditure, at 2.2% of GDP, will be closing in on advanced-country levels.
While the American and Yemeni governments have lauded the drones’ precise targeting, they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes, including how many have been conducted, who has been targeted, or, crucially, the number and identities of civilians killed.
Indeed, if the US never acknowledges the specific strikes, how can ordinary Americans possibly know that Rasilah al-Faqih, a pregnant Yemeni woman, was killed in Walad Rabei’, along with her husband and ten-year-old daughter, as they headed home from a visit to the doctor? Or that Abdoh Mohammed al-Jarraah’s house in Silat al-Jarraah had 19 people, including women and children, inside when it was hit by a US drone strike?
It should come as no surprise, then, that civilians like Nasser, who have lost mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters in US strikes, are outraged not only at the US, but also at the Yemeni government, which consented to the attacks.
After the attacks on New York and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001, the group's battle took on a geopolitical dimension, as its fighters objected to Yemen's decision to collaborate with the United States and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation.
In response, armed groups seized checkpoints and closed the port of Aden.
If the turmoil is not curtailed and the Saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country's ability to function, Yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures.
But, although al-Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution, his decision was anything but altruistic.
While the Central Security Service, led by Saleh’s nephew Yahya, has received millions of dollars to fight al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza.
When more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there, al-Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war.
If the Salehs retain control of the air force, which remains under the control of Saleh’s half-brother, employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath.
Accelerating the Clean-Energy Revolution
Clean Energy Solutions Center’s no-cost “Ask an Expert” service has provided policy assistance to more than 60 countries.
At the same time, more than one billion people still have no access to electricity.
The transition to a world powered by clean energy has the potential not only to reduce carbon pollution and the risks of climate change, but also to create entrepreneurial opportunities and jobs, realize cost savings for business and individuals, enhance energy security, and improve access to energy worldwide.
The region’s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests.
It is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles, rules, and decision-making procedures for the region.
Its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century.
Asia-Pacific leaders must shake off their complacency.
In these circumstances, the US and China – the only viable candidates for global leadership – must achieve a grand compromise that reconciles their fundamental interests, in turn enabling them to act in concert to provide and protect global public goods.
The quid quo pro for these changes to US policy would be a commitment by China to respect and defend a set of international norms, principles, and institutions that was created largely without its involvement.
Nevertheless, understanding this phenomenon and its political consequences sheds light on what other OECD countries might face in the near future.
Instead, the gerontocracy has simply realized older generations’ dreams of equity and social security at the expense of today’s youth, who have been shouldered with a crushing burden of public debt.
The former can be physical (according to some studies, Italy is the only European country experiencing a “brain drain” rather than a “brain exchange”) or silent (for example, low voter turnout).
Leaders of OECD countries should look at Italy and recognize the dangers emerging from their young people who are being left behind.
In the early 2000s, short-term capital began to flow into China, with investors betting on the renminbi’s appreciation and, from 2004-2006, on rising asset prices.
Given China’s twin surpluses, the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003, so it has been selling central-bank bills ever since, with CN¥5 trillion ($812 billion) in such bills currently held by banks.
The quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments.
The fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place – including real-estate bubbles, local-government debt, rapid growth in shadow-banking activity, and rising corporate leverage ratios – remain unresolved.
This destructive cycle will be difficult to break.
Despite these risks, it is too early to bet on a corporate-debt crisis in China.
But the truth of life for a political prisoner, even for one on a hunger strike, is the opposite.
But here, in this place, it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination.

He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause. And he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family.
सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि हमारे ख़िलाफ़ रूसी सेना के लामबंद हो जाने के बावजूद, हम चुनाव अभियान की तैयारी कर रहे हैं।  अगले महीने, यूक्रेन के नागरिक स्वतंत्र रूप से नए राष्ट्रपति का चुनाव करेंगे - जो लोकतंत्र बनाए रखने की हमारी तथाकथित विफलता पर रूसी प्रचार का सर्वोत्तम संभव मुँहतोड़ जवाब होगा।

TOKYO – Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, with official ceremonies held in Washington, DC, and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary.
There have also been political heavyweights, such as Michael Mansfield, a long-time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate, former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley, and Senator Howard Baker, who also served as President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff.
Instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him, he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected, but that will help to transform myriad aspects of Japan’s economy.
Asia’s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the United States faced when Mao Zedong marched into Beijing, and again when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah in Iran.
Yet Thaksin’s supporters did not abandon him.
So, in essence, what is happening in Thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country’s entrenched elite.
By standing aside as Thailand’s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country’s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule, Asia’s democracies risk driving some elements of the Thaksin camp into the arms of China, which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force.
If that happens, we will all know who lost Thailand. We did.
But the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama’s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe’s government who question Obama’s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America’s defense commitment.
Strangely, it is all but forgotten – particularly by the Chinese – that for two decades Japan has watched China’s rise quietly from the sidelines (even supportively, to the extent that Japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy).
Fortunately, Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different.
TOKYO – Shinzo Abe’s second term as Japan’s prime minister began with a laser-like focus on economic revitalization.
A permanent National Security Secretariat, headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience, will be established in the prime minister’s office, with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy.
Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue, it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring.
For the people of Mindanao, this is a life-changing development.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea. Indeed, the Philippines is challenging China’s claims in the International Court of Arbitration, using provisions from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
But Japan, having already endured the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 14, meaning that the war was already over when the Red Army marched in.
The lesson now being drawn is that, where territorial disputes are concerned, Japan must not kowtow to “attempts to change the status quo backed by force.”
Moreover, several bilateral economic cooperation efforts, such as projects involving liquefied natural gas, were moving forward.
A military coup, imposed following the Thai constitutional court’s ouster of an elected government on spurious legal grounds, can lead only to an artificial peace.
Putin’s idea was that he could pivot Russia’s economy into a partnership with China.
Narendra Modi’s landslide victory in India’s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller, but may well mark a decisive break with India’s traditional inward-looking policies.
Abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in Singapore at this year’s Shangri La Dialogue, the annual meeting of Asian military and civilian military leaders.
Great significance was read into who signed an official document, or who stood where atop Lenin’s Tomb in Red Square when reviewing military parades.
I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong-il’s death has been his sister, Kim Kyong-hui, and no one else.
North Korea, always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states, remains in a twilight world.
While China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime, North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself.
For Germany and South Korea, however, relationships with historic allies – NATO and the United States, respectively – appear to be changing before our eyes.
Every gesture by the South toward one of the protagonists – China, the US, Japan, and North Korea – elicits so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow devise a compensatory policy.
This is not the only recent case in which Germany has distanced itself from its allies and partners.
TOKYO – Georges Clemenceau, who, as France’s prime minister, led his country to victory in World War I, famously said that “war is too important to be left to the generals.”
Their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them, but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of Franco-German enmity, and to generations yet to come, which would benefit from reconciliation.
No doubt, many, if not most, South Korean foreign-policy experts and strategists share that sentiment.
After all, member countries would then be able to pool their resources, harmonize programs, and rationalize costs, thereby reducing individual governments’ financial burden.
The truth is that the only kind of defense the British accept is that conducted by a coalition of European states acting under their national flags, as occurred in Libya.
The French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic – exemplified by Germany’s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations.
The GDP-Wellbeing Gap
But GDP fails to account for changes in a country’s stock of assets, making it difficult for policymakers to balance economic, social, and environmental concerns.
By providing a long-term comparison between GDP and “inclusive wealth” for 20 countries, the report aimed to motivate policymakers to take a more comprehensive, longer-term view of their economies’ development.
The world must align its value systems with this reality.
For example, the “triangular trade” model – whereby China imports significant quantities of intermediate inputs from East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, then exports the assembled products to the US – allows for substantial redundancy in trade records. In 2010, more than one-quarter of the world’s $19 trillion in exports was counted more than once.
In 2011, Hong Kong handled about 14% of mainland China’s exports and 13% of its imports, with more than 60% of Hong Kong’s total re-exports originating from the Chinese mainland. Meanwhile, by exporting products through designated export-processing zones, companies gain access to export-tax refunds and, once the intermediate cargo is imported and processed, advantageous export tariffs.
China’s Quest for Value
At the same time, it should preserve a level playing field by explicitly prohibiting rule changes, limiting the establishment of entry and exit barriers in various industries, and using taxation, finance, and brand authentication to cultivate core competitiveness.
Although there are several ongoing trade and investment negotiations – including the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – Chinese policies remain largely defined by the traditional World Trade Organization (WTO) framework.
With rapid growth in the local market, China could become a leading source of global demand, a hub of high-level factors of production, and a strategic center, with the Shanghai free-trade zone at its core.
And this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution, censored media, and a partisan security and military establishment.
The UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections.
Zimbabwe’s Permanent Guantánamo
It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court.
Most recently, the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence.
The actions of the Mugabe regime in the run-up to Tsvangirai’s decision demand a strong regional response to what is clearly a stolen victory.
Regional institutions can entrench themselves only if their members promote adherence to the spirit and letter of their legal frameworks.
The SADC’s censure of Mugabe and his regime should be backed up by concrete actions, such as restrictions on all arms flows to Zimbabwe, travel restrictions on senior officials of Zimbabwe’s ruling ZANU-PF party, and the threat of property seizures and the freezing of financial assets in the region and beyond.
Will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz? Although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category, he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job.
Any number of developing countries, from China to India to Brazil, could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down.
Third, Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid.
Or, less likely, he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over-reaching vision of government intervention, as others have tried.
He speaks the language of populism, raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing, schools, and health care.
Dismissing complaints, Zuma insists, “There’s no cloud around me.”
Yet, according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, at his core, “Zuma is a conservative.”
