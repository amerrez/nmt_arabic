# nmt_arabic
The neural network in this repo is from the google blog https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt

I worked on the English-Arabic data from here http://www.casmacat.eu/corpus/news-commentary.html
and convert it to the format required by the google nmt network in the blog mentioned above tensorflow/nmt

I trained this network with the converted En-Ar data on an AWS instance with an Nvidia GPU. No satisfying results yet.
