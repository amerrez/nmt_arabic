Indeed, Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky recently criticized the film for its darkness and pessimism.
George Orwell neatly summarized why: “All propaganda is a lie even when it's telling the truth."
No government, rich or poor, can ignore the imperative to encourage economic growth.
Like the dramatic changes once wrought by mass production, there is similar potential in the development and application of 3D printing, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and other resource-efficient technologies.
By adopting new economic models, their large but finite reserves will not be rendered useless; they will simply last longer.
By Freedom House’s count, more than 60% of the world’s countries are electoral democracies – regimes in which political parties compete and come to power in regularly scheduled elections – up from around 40% in the late 1980s.
They may be comparatively few in number, but they can mobilize material resources if they do not get their way.
In return, the masses – or their representatives – agree not to expropriate the elite.
One set of circumstances that favors liberal democracy is the absence of clear-cut ethnic or other identity cleavages among the non-elites.
Alternatively, perhaps liberal democracy has little to do with the balance of power among social groups and their strategic motivations.
The space business was the preserve of a few governments, plus a number of large cost-plus contractors who lived in symbiosis with their government customers. 
And it's a huge opportunity for NASA as well as for space exploration and science.
I'm not suggesting that private companies should be allowed to kill people, but they can take risks (with people who understand the risks they are taking), which governments cannot.  Of course, they are also incentivized not to take risks; any start-up space company that carelessly kills someone will probably also kill itself.
Their scorn has also extended to the second part of the budget, a program that normally they would have liked: bringing back to the US jobs that currently go to Russians.
Look around you. There are lots of organizations like that, waiting to be liberated, their employees yearning to breathe free.
She was “sure that it [would] be used by Pyongyang and our own government in attempting to make political points.”
Rock music was severely restricted in Communist dictatorships, just as jazz was in Nazi Germany, for all the Platonic reasons: uncontrolled passions were seen as a threat to the perfect order of the state.
Obviously, Dvorak and Wagner are not Zappa and the Stones.
There are plenty of rock bands in China already.
Milton Friedman was a giant among modern social thinkers for at least two reasons.
Any attempt to use expansionary government policies to drive unemployment below a certain level, they demonstrated, would fuel inflationary expectations and undermine both economic growth and employment.
For example, he pioneered the idea of school vouchers, arguing that private competition would ensure better educational performance than government systems.
Libya After Qaddafi
According to the same study, which was based on 323 cases of armed and unarmed opposition campaigns between 1900 and 2006, the likelihood of democratic transition within five years following a successful armed opposition campaign is only 3%, compared to 51% when campaigns were unarmed.
A move by army officers in Tripoli against Qaddafi and his sons might end the conflict, with military commanders getting the credit – and the political capital.
The fourth scenario is partition, with the old three-province, Ottoman-style setup commonly mentioned: Cyrenaica (east), Fezzan (south), and Tripolitania (west).
This is a far cry from recent years, when staying at a Libyan-owned hotel would make you subject to a US felony charge!
Of course, it is unrealistic and naïve to expect that the changes now underway in Libya will result in a rapid transition to European-style democracy.
DOHA – “They are armed, I am not going to fight a losing battle and kill my men over a demolished shrine,” said Fawzi Abd al-‘Aali, the former Libyan interior minister, before he “resigned” last August.
“They should not come near the Shariah. It should be above the constitution, and not an article for referendum.”
The National Guard, headed by the former LIFG deputy leader, Khaled al-Sharif, absorbed more than 30 brigades, mostly from the west and southwest.
One of the Muslim Brothers’ Web sites includes such a statement, and Libya’s Grand Mufti, Sheikh Sadeq al-Gheriani, also condemned the attack.
The LIA has always been exceptional; indeed, several indices that rank SWFs on transparency, accountability, and governance issues have traditionally given only Iran a lower ranking.
In this case, the Libyans did not respond by withdrawing a large amount of funds, but that could happen in the future.
Large allocations based on pragmatic political concerns, such as Libya-Italy relations, or cronyism should be reevaluated in the light of better and stronger governance practices.
Other members were previously political prisoners or exiled dissidents.
Instead of injecting new blood into senior government posts during his 42 years in power, Qaddafi merely shuffled cronies between ministries.
Such trials were held in revolutionary courts staffed by Qaddafi zealots and operating outside the formal judiciary.
With the NTC confronting so many dilemmas with so little time, it must concentrate on a small number of key issues that can be resolved before it hands over power.
The NTC has preserved much of the institutional paralysis and knee-jerk behavior typical of Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi’s overthrown regime.
With no access to Libyan assets frozen abroad, it frequently paid salaries weeks in arrears.
When a colonel recently asked NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdel-Jalil why he has not moved to merge the militias into a national army, Abdel-Jalil replied, “I head the legislative branch.
Bureaucrats lament ministerial dithering.
But Abdel-Jalil named no specific foreign powers and offered no proof to support his allegations, which sounded much like Qaddafi’s frequent rants against “imperialist-Zionist plots.”
By “better,” I mean better ethically, not materially.
But socialism, in its classical form, failed – as it had to.
This made him a fervent free trader.
Their choices are framed by their societies’ dominant culture.
It was only in the eighteenth century that greed became morally respectable. It was now considered healthily Promethean to turn wealth into money and put it to work to make more money, because by doing this one was benefiting humanity.
The evidence suggests that economies would be more stable and citizens happier if wealth and income were more evenly distributed.
And from that remnant of the Biblical story of creation sprung the notion of a tree of life, alongside major concepts such as gradualism (the view that speciation does not occur abruptly) and the idea that minor selection pressures can, over time, have a profound effect on improved fitness.
The unidentified genetic sequences pose a problem, because it is not known whether vehicles other than viruses, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes exist.
But the current classification of the domains of life is based on the ribosome – the production apparatus of proteins – which does not exist in these viruses.
Today, Darwin’s theory of evolution is more a hindrance than a help, because it has become a quasi-theological creed that is preventing the benefits of improved research from being fully realized.

Everyone has cancer cells every day, but usually the body deals with them, using strength gained from eating right, exercise, and social engagement.
In my case, they could have gone something like this: assume you have a 70% chance of survival (defined as no recurrence for five years) if you simply have the tumor removed. Radiation and chemotherapy treatments can reduce recurrence by a further 30%.
Whether we are choosing what to eat or how much to exercise, or trying to assess our chances of a specific condition, the numbers make it feel real and immediate.
Although it is very similar to a natural bacterium from which it was largely copied, the creators put distinctive strings of DNA into its genome to prove that it is not a natural object.
But the work has taken 20 scientists a decade to complete, at an estimated cost of $40 million, and commercial investors are an obvious source for such funds.
The most exciting prospect held out by Venter, however, is a form of algae that can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to create diesel fuel or gasoline.
Presumably, our attempt at resurrecting it was pathetic and hopeless.
The Bhagwati-Sutherland Report amply documents that much has already been agreed upon in all the major areas.
These rules are then advertised as “avant garde,” implying that the PTAs are the “vanguard” of new rules.
In the Middle East, democratic development has been lagging.
Most encouraging is that producing countries themselves are beginning to seize the initiative.
Two-thirds of the world’s most impoverished people live in about 60 developing or transition countries that depend on oil, mining, or gas revenues.
The EITI still has a long way to go, but it is one of the most effective vehicles available for achieving a global standard of disclosure and accountability.
No fewer than 210 Congolese nongovernmental organizations, including those enjoying the widest recognition and respect across the country, recently joined in challenging President Joseph Kabila’s attempt to take control of the National Assembly (the lower house of Parliament) that came into office after historic elections in 2006.
The United Nation peacekeeping force in the Congo, MONUC, is the UN’s largest and most expensive intervention anywhere in the world.
Newspapers around the world dutifully wrote feel-good stories about how engaged environmentalists celebrated as the lights went out around the world.
When asked to extinguish electric lights, most people around the world would turn to candlelight instead.
Nor do we hear that the Antarctic is experiencing record sea ice coverage since satellite measurements began.
Like Father, Like Son
But Qaddafi’s regime became an international pariah mainly for a series of terrorist plots abroad, not for crimes against humanity committed against Libyans.
When I visited Tripoli in March 2010 for a “national reconciliation” conference, the conflicting statements given by Saif al-Islam and security officials surprised me.
Like Water for Climate
Likewise, the latest Hydration for Health science gathering, which promotes drinking more water, has been sponsored by Danone, which sells bottled water under brand names like Volvic and Evian.
Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation: prices have increased six-fold since 1969, so, while corn futures did set a record of about $8 per bushel in late July, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970’s, reaching a whopping $16 in 1974.
That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it.
Success will require that up to 80% of proven oil, gas, and coal reserves not be consumed.
Making matters worse, the details of these agreements are largely hidden, thereby preventing citizens from holding their governments accountable, which in turn undermines democracy and facilitates corruption.
And are citizens’ voices being heard?
This goal was achieved – but only by creating a huge 37-page document containing every possible option that countries may want to see in next year’s deal.
Likewise, the proposal by the European Union and the United States that countries’ plans be subject to some kind of assessment was dropped from the final text.
For this reason, the developed world has long wanted to replace the “firewall” between the two historic groupings with a form of differentiation that better reflects the contemporary world.
The Lima conference has shown just how hard the negotiations in Paris next year will be, despite recent optimism about global progress.
Faced with the urgent necessity of alleviating so many Americans’ suffering, Obama knows only too well that the “audacity of hope” will not be sufficient to the immensity of the challenges confronting him.
But this should not go too far, for there are limits to what the state can do, and the strength of private initiative constitutes one key aspect of America, which became the world’s leading nation thanks to its dynamism, flexibility, and individual inventiveness.
Yet the cards Obama is holding should not be underrated. Unlike Roosevelt, he has a perfect understanding of the nature of the economic challenges facing him, and, like Churchill, he benefits from the support of a population ready to follow him in a climate of national unity, at least in the short run.  
Similarly, from a global perspective, opening trade can contribute to the world’s overall economic growth, but does not guarantee that the benefits will be fairly distributed among countries.
For example, one of the critical issues blocking progress on the World Trade Organization’s Doha Development Agenda of global free-trade talks centers on the extent to which major developing countries should open their markets.
Thus, aid for trade, one of the key tasks on the WTO agenda, has weak institutional links to trade negotiations.
But doing so requires innovative approaches that help to ensure that trade serves developing countries, rather than vice versa.
Likewise, in October 2014, US Treasury yields plummeted by almost 40 basis points in minutes, which statisticians argue should occur only once in three billion years.
Imagine a bank that invests in illiquid assets but allows depositors to redeem their cash overnight: if a run on these funds occurs, the need to sell the illiquid assets can push their price very low very fast, in what is effectively a fire sale.
But, over time, the longer central banks create liquidity to suppress short-run volatility, the more they will feed price bubbles in equity, bond, and other asset markets.
Service companies such as airlines could ask employees to collect feedback, but it was overly complicated.   
They can listen for many purposes – from figuring out what products or services to offer and understanding which customer wants what, to repairing the damage done when something goes wrong.
All of that is important, but then there’s the listening you do so that your customers can feel listened to.
But how can you make up for the headache they had all day from lack of sleep? You can’t – but showing that you noticed their unhappiness with you counts for a lot.
You don’t pick an arsonist to head the fire department, I thought when Obama named him co-chair of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform.
In other words, the large surplus in the Social Security trust fund, which is made up of government bonds that general revenues are earmarked to pay for, does not really exist and cannot be drawn upon.
Perhaps the most bizarre of Simpson’s claims that are quoted by Berry is that the Social Security Commission of 1983 “never knew there was a baby boom....”


The loss of output in Italy since the beginning of the crisis is as great as it was in the 1930’s.
The problem is that the prescriptions being imposed are leading to massive underutilization of these resources.
There will also have to be Eurobonds, or an equivalent instrument.
But, rather than enhancing solidarity within Europe, it is sowing seeds of discord within and between countries.
But it is structural reform of the eurozone’s institutional arrangements, not reforms within individual countries, that will have the greatest impact.
The image of the warrior leader lingers in modern times.
They combine fear with corruption to maintain kleptocracies dominated by “the big man” and his coterie.
Various studies show that tall men are often favored, and that corporate CEOs are taller than average.
Surprisingly, however, when telephone interviews were included in the process, beautiful people did better, even though they were unseen by the employers.
Modern information societies require us to go beyond the “big man” approach to leadership.
Yet, the world faces many other vast challenges.
Yet the cost of the Kyoto Protocol would be a staggering $180 billion a year.
This would be easier, much less costly, and ultimately do far more good. Indeed, the Copenhagen Consensus experts discovered that for every dollar invested in Kyoto-style battling climate change, we could do up to 120 times more good with in numerous other areas.
The fundamental difficulty in planning for enhanced longevity is that we do not know whether it will really happen.
If there were no longevity risk – that is, if the probability of dying at each age in the future were reliably known – then pension funds could easily offer life annuities to large numbers of people by investing their assets in bonds of various maturities in order to pay out just the right amount each year.
Moreover, it is not clear that the EIB can get further help from reinsurers in managing the risks it assumes by issuing such bonds because reinsurers do not yet see how they can fully hedge the risks involved.
But longevity bonds, while only experimental today, will eventually become vitally important to the world economy.
The emergence of a non-polar world could prove to be mostly negative, making it more difficult to generate collective responses to pressing regional and global challenges.   More decision makers make it more difficult to make decisions.
Combating terrorism is also essential if the non-polar era is not to turn into a modern Dark Age.
Greater economic and military assistance to increase states’ ability to meet their responsibilities to their citizens and neighbors will also be essential.
This is less than optimal, but in a non-polar world, what is best may well prove the enemy of the possible.
But Keating’s remarks raise a general question about history that goes to the heart of the sense of identity that binds every community.
Sooner or later, the healthiest societies face up to what they have been – good and bad – and grow in decency and self-confidence as a result.
There are at least three lessons to draw from these musings of a one-time university history student.
Living on a Volcano
In rich countries, mass poverty, which seemed to have been eliminated around 1980, has reappeared.
In France, by contrast, 200,000 to 300,000 more people enter the labor market than leave it in each generation – and this does not include immigration, which, although slowing recently, represents a large number of job seekers.
But for the past three years, France has had a government that no longer believes that a socially oriented urban policy works.
Is not freedom enough? Why put security on the same level as that supreme value?
Nor is it only bombs that add to life's general uncertainties. Gradually, awareness is setting in that global warming is not just a gloom and doom fantasy.
So what should we do? Perhaps we should look at Popper again and remember his advice: to use what reason we have to tackle our insecurities.
A third need is to preserve, and in many cases to recreate, what one might call islands of security.
False gods have always profited from a widespread sense of insecurity.
This new critique of capitalism recently culminated in a series of attacks by the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Franz Müntefering.
But Müntefering has a point.
Wages rose rapidly and most Germans experienced growing prosperity.
The share of net investment in GNP is now the second lowest in all OECD countries.
PARIS – As the deepest economic crisis of our lifetimes stretches into its seventh year, most OECD countries are continuing to underperform.
In short, as we argued during the OECD Forum and annual Ministerial Council Meeting last week, this time we need to promote investments that focus on people and the planet.
In order to encourage private investors to pursue long-term, responsible projects, governments need to promote consistent policies and frameworks.
Savings must be channeled to firms that need capital for innovation and sustainable job creation.
There is, of course, no Asian alternative to Russia’s cultural and political orientation towards Europe.
Russia must act now to secure a more dignified and beneficial place in a future world order.
Of course, such a strategy will require highways, bridges, railways, and seaports. (There are practically no grain-export terminals in Russia’s eastern regions, for example.)
But Europe's new eastern members can also act as a beacon for the Union, as Jacques Rupnik suggests.
Having spent a decade dismantling the debris of state socialism, most of these countries chafe at the idea of importing the European social market's idea of solidarity via the EU.
Second, public attitudes toward the social market system are remarkably similar in both Eastern and Western Europe.
Clearly, if the social market model is to expand eastward - thereby ensuring its viability within the whole Union - this is the only viable alternative.
So it must be doing something right.
An enlightened corporate state, where unions fully support growth and competitiveness objectives, can deliver the economic goods as well as more de-centralized systems.
Rather, she simply understands that for an economy that needs to stay competitive, bad-mouthing the euro and the ECB sends the wrong signals.
Sarkozy’s first foreign trip as France’s new president was to visit Chancellor Merkel.
Fortunately, at least half the voters in the region appreciate these improvements; otherwise, the situation would be far worse.
The state-owned oil company, which accounts for a major chunk of government revenue, is hugely inefficient, and invests far too little in new equipment and technology.
Does the pied piper of Venezuela offer a fairer and better way to grow?
Losing the Foreign Investment Race
To change the way Latin American countries sell themselves to foreign investors is a creative challenge. Selling goods for export and selling the country to foreign investors is very different.
An effective FDI promotion agency must be headed by an executive director with strong credentials and an excellent reputation in the private sector, supplemented by good international contacts and fluency in English.
But, since 2003, Turkey’s virtually unquestioned alliance with the United States has undergone a profound re-evaluation, due to the Iraq War, and the Turkish consensus on its decades-long EU candidacy has begun to wobble, owing to EU dithering.  Given Turkey’s central role not only in maintaining peace in the volatile Caucasus region but also in promoting peace in the Middle East – the talks now underway between Syria and Israel are, after all, being conducted with Turkish mediation – neglecting Turkey is not only foolish, it is dangerous.
In the early 1990’s, some Turkish generals saw the humiliation of Russian troops in Chechnya as part of a long-awaited revenge.
Even if the AKP can rely on the allegiance of millions of voters and swarms of new members anxious to join the winning side, the secularists are deeply entrenched in Turkey’s institutions, universities, media, and business.
But did it ever occur to anybody how hard Americans must work to make everyone else look good?
It isn’t. Going deep into debt when you have that much money to spend takes a lot of hard work.
Sure, the decision to invade Iraq was a big help in pushing the country’s finances off a cliff, but that is far from the whole story.
Foreigners are either going to start earning much better returns in the US, pushing American debt levels into unsustainable territory, or else they will pull back and invest elsewhere.
OK, so maybe it is too soon for the world to start toasting America’s insane consumption patterns.
Passivity is a low-cost approach – tracking a benchmark requires no work.
And some of these managers – like hedge funds – are not available to average investors.
Weeding out the bad and the ugly based on these scores, and thus picking more of the good apples, has been shown to provide higher returns with lower risk than actively managed alpha or passive beta funds.
Solar energy reaching the earth’s surface provides 5,000 times humanity’s energy needs.
And our cities will be cleaner, quieter, and more pleasant places to live as a result.
But no such thief exists, and we are cursed with fossil fuels in dangerous abundance.
The biggest threat to a prosperous low-carbon future is not a lack of technological options, but the waste that low fossil-fuel prices encourage.
Maybe this holiday season we should wish for a miracle.
From 2005 to 2015, the monetary base soared at an annual rate of 17.8%, whereas the CPI increased at an annual rate of just 1.9%.
The banks exchanged an interest-paying Treasury bill for a reserve deposit at the Fed that historically did not earn any interest.
Although a link between the Fed’s creation of reserves and the subsequent increase in spending remained, its magnitude changed dramatically. The Fed increased its securities holdings from less than $1 trillion in 2007 to more than $4 trillion today.
Labor markets have tightened significantly, with the overall unemployment rate down to 5.4%.
WASHINGTON, DC – The sharp drop in the price of crude oil since late June has been grabbing headlines worldwide – and producing a lot of contradictory explanations.
Of course, climate science is not precise; instead, it works in terms of probability ranges.
The structure of a carbon-pricing scheme remains up for discussion.
Today’s environment of falling oil prices enables the world to take that step.
And a sign of prosperity is supposed to be good health and longevity.
It is perhaps true that unhealthy habits are more concentrated among poor Americans, a disproportionate number of whom are black.
In 2005, President George W. Bush’s administration made it far more difficult for households to declare bankruptcy and write off debt.
Our data showed that GDP had fallen some 30% since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
As a result, the price formation process is much clumsier nowadays, with considerably longer adjustment lags.
Prices plummeted by more than half in a period of just a few months last year, catching many oil traders and analysts by surprise.
Over the next few months, the US will indeed alter its supply and demand conditions in a way that puts a floor under oil prices and enables a gradual recovery in the market.
AMSTERDAM – Western Europe’s small democracies have, on the whole, been exceptionally fortunate.
Although the Dutch government is still managed mostly by mainstream, steady-as-you-go Christian Democrats, right-wing populism is growing. Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party wants to ban the Koran, halt Muslim immigration, and deprive delinquents with an immigrant background of Dutch citizenship.
Much criticism and even abuse has been heaped on the Dutch for the way her adopted country has treated her.
It is easy to voice contempt of the Dutch government. But what has been lost in all the commentary is the nature of Hirsi Ali’s rise to prominence.
That, too, is the natural fate of being a lucky little country in Western Europe.
To be sure, Putin should be praised for substantial economic reforms during his first three years.
Moreover, Putin’s associates wanted Yukos’ wealth, which was confiscated by the state oil company Rosneft through lawless taxation, leaving Putin’s tax reform and judicial reform in tatters and severely undermining property rights.
The not very profitable state-owned Vneshtorgbank, for example, is on a buying spree, aggravating the quality of Russian banking.
Putin and his KGB friends from St. Petersburg sit safely on all this wealth, thanks to their authoritarian governance and control over all security organs.
How would the veil of ignorance work in a boardroom?
Not knowing whether they were male or female, they would ensure pay equity and better policies concerning parental leave and child care.
If directors remind themselves each time they enter the boardroom why they are there, and pause for a moment to consider how their views would be affected if they did not know who they were, they would make better decisions for the company and for the entire system in which it operates.
They are becoming more educated and aware of how companies operate, and they are more proactive and outspoken when they believe a company has crossed the line.
There was a massive conversation going on, and BP was neither a part of it nor able to control it via traditional communication-management methods.
With all of that comes a culture of questioning that which was previously unquestioned – including how companies are run and whether an organization’s actions are ethical.
Instead, they will make real changes – and they will be better off for it.
FIFA has two problems.
FIFA is as complex as any large multinational private or public organization; how it is governed must reflect that.
They are taking a much more active and public role in speaking out against bribery, corruption, and excessive pay packages, and in favor of corporate social responsibility and fair labor practices.
The caption to a picture of Blatter on page six of FIFA’s 2013 financial report reads: “We have reached very high levels of accountability, transparency, and financial control.”
The problem has two aspects.
But many branches of the service sector are a sink of dead-end, no-hope jobs.
But there is also a more troubling possibility: if, by proceeding on our current profligate path, we succeed in making natural resources scarce, we will require a new wave of technology, regardless of the cost, to rescue us from calamity.
Many other European countries are adopting the second solution.
After all, both capitalism and economics need scarcity to justify their existence, and will not give it up readily.
Machiavelli's message, however, was more complex.
“To those seeing and hearing him, the ruler should appear to be all mercy, all faithfulness, all integrity, all humanity, and all religion.
The notion that, at its core, Europe should be focused on something as mundane as tweaking fiscal rules seems disappointing, to say the least – especially as the continent confronts an intensifying humanitarian crisis, caused by the influx of refugees from war-ravaged countries like Libya and Syria.
Machiavelli's metaphor for the mystery of effective political conduct provides a potent template.
One of the most famous examples concerns the Great Depression – an epoch that policymakers frequently drew upon in trying to come to terms with the post-2007 financial crisis.
Would it not be desirable just to hide losses until uncertainty passed and confidence returned? In that case, new profits could quickly be used to plug the gaps, and no one would ever know about an apparently successful deception.
Indeed, misrepresentation by governments – driven by the belief that political ingenuity can stabilize expectations – is actually at the root of many financial crises.
To revert to the example of Depression-era Italy: the state holding-company edifice created to save the banks and maintain confidence proved to be an increasingly bureaucratic and costly burden on the Italian economy.
It is difficult to overstate the significance of the occasion. According to Héctor Schamis, a political scientist at Georgetown University, if a similar political change had occurred in France or Brazil, the country’s citizens would be celebrating the birth of a new republic.
And yet, the world should not expect free-market zealotry from Macri. He heads a broad coalition that includes his own liberal-minded Republican Proposal Party, the center-left Radical Civic Union, and other centrist groupings.
And the budget deficit has reached 7% of GDP. Some adjustment is inevitable.
Likewise, Macri’s victory could give voters in Venezuela – headed to the polls on December 6 – the courage they need to cast their ballots against their increasingly authoritarian government.
Property prices from London to San Francisco have risen to nosebleed-inducing levels.
And using interest rates to address such concerns may interfere with the central bank’s primary objective of keeping inflation near target.
Any attempt by the Fed to impose caps on loan-to-value ratios would also excite Americans’ fears of concentrated financial power – fears that have intensified since the crisis.
The Swedish Riksbank provides a cautionary case in point.
Gone, it seems, is the heyday of T-shirts, toys, plastic flowers, tiles, hooks, springs, and the like.
According to a study by the US consulting firm Jassin O’Rourke, labor costs in China are higher than in seven other Asian countries.
By January 2010, the value of exports has returned to its previous level in the same period of 2008.
For local planners, the export shock was a wake-up call for change.
Traditionally, contract manufacturers in China are scattered and fiercely competitive.
Compared to many developing countries, China’s government is stable and embraces foreign investment.
Her decision has raised the profile of Malawi, home to recurrent food shortages and seasonal famines.
Philere Nkhoma, an adviser to farmers in Malawi, asks. “Let’s have milk.
Nkhoma’s own story mirrors the shift in the status of farming in Africa.
Sachs has raised about $150 million for the villages, enough for five years of support.
Instead of more Madonnas, who in the glare of global publicity saves a lone child’s life, Africa needs more Nkhomas: passionate cheerleaders with deep local knowledge and a willingness to stand alongside peasants in the fields in order to grow food for all the other children.
There, until Madonna came into contact with him, he was living with about 500 other children.
Admittedly, David will be cut off from his cultural roots.
Despite the high rate of HIV/AIDS infections, Malawi’s population, like that of many developing nations, is growing rapidly.
Although good progress in meeting these goals has been made in Asia, in Africa there are now 140 million more people living in extreme poverty than there were in 1990.
Is it entirely relative, or are there objective grounds to characterize a behavior or act as evil? Do all confrontations occur between legitimate parties – with, say, one person’s terrorist being another’s freedom fighter – or can we say that some fights really are between good and evil?
We are programmed by our genes to feel concern for babies and empathy for people in pain.
The biologist Martin Nowak has argued that the only way humans have been able to sustain cooperation is by developing cheap ways to punish misbehavior.
In the US, there is a natural tendency to punish political candidates when they lie, but mostly about their personal peccadillos.
Magna Carta at 800
Copies were made and dispersed to many of the great English cathedrals.
The tradition of natural law offers an answer that was familiar to medieval scholars, for whom natural law was knowable to us by our natural reason (as opposed to those laws that could be discovered only through divine revelation).
Abbas introduced a totally different style of management from that of Arafat.
But, unlike Oslo, when Abbas was working under Arafat and able to project power from that base, as Palestinian president he was both negotiator and supposedly the center of power.
The nominal reason is Hamas’s refusal to recognize Israel.

इस पद्धति का दुनिया भर में पहले से ही अच्छा उपयोग किया जा रहा है। उदाहरण के लिए, “वन खातों” से यह पता चला है कि मध्य और दक्षिण अमेरिका में ग्वाटेमाला में वनों की कटाई की सबसे तेज़ दर है जहाँ परिवारों द्वारा अपनी खाना पकाने की जरूरतों को पूरा करने के लिए सबसे अधिक अनियंत्रित कटाई की जाती है। इस जानकारी ने ग्वाटेमाला सरकार को देश के वानिकी कानून की समीक्षा करने, और, जलाऊ लकड़ी के उपयोग को नियंत्रित करने, नई रणनीतियों के लिए निधियाँ मुहैया करने, वनों की अनधिकृत कटाई को रोकने, और परिवारों को वैकल्पिक ऊर्जा स्रोतों का उपयोग करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करने के लिए प्रेरित किया है।
ऐसा ही एक स्रोत है प्रवासियों द्वारा वित्तपोषण जिसका पर्याप्त दोहन नहीं हुआ है. प्रवासियों द्वारा वित्तपोषण का अर्थ है विदेशों में कार्यरत प्रवासियों द्वारा धन की बचत और इसे उनके मूल देश में परिवार व मित्रों को भेजा जाना. चुनौती है इस आय को किस तरह प्रभावी ढंग से प्रवाहित किया जाए.

प्रवासियों की बचत के बेहतर इस्तेमाल का एक और तरीका हो सकती है नई प्रवासी वित्तीय प्रणालियों की रचना. कम मूल्य की जमानत राशि (यथा 1000 डॉलर) जिस पर 3-4% ब्याज दर हो, आप्रवासी कर्मियों के लिए आकर्षक विकल्प साबित हो सकती है जिन्हें अभी अपने कार्य के देशों में जमाखातों पर न्यूनतम् ब्याज मिलता है. पांच साल के डायस्पोरा बॉन्ड प्रवासी को उस संप्रभु बॉन्ड से कम दर पर ब्याज मिलेगा जो विदेशी संस्थागत् निवेशकों को बेचा जाता है. इसका कारण है कि प्रवासी निवेशकों के उनके मूल देश में जोखिम को कम करके आंका जाता है. ये बॉन्ड विकासशील देशों में अप्रवासी विदेशी-मुद्रा जमाखातों की तुलना में कहीं अधिक स्थायी भी होंगे. और कार्य के बड़े देशों में उचित प्राधिकरणों के पास पंजीकृत कराने से ये बॉन्ड काफी सुरक्षित बन जाएंगे.
लेकिन विकासशील विश्व में विकास डेटा एक दुर्लभ संसाधन बना हुआ है। सामाजिक और आर्थिक प्रगति का आकलन करने - और उसे प्रोत्साहित करने - की दृष्टि से इनका जो महत्व है उसे देखते हुए इस कमी पर तुरंत ध्यान दिया जाना चाहिए। विकास डेटा तैयार करने और उसके उपयोग को बढ़ावा देने के लिए किसी उत्प्रेरक का होना आवश्यक है। इसे ध्यान में रखते हुए, 2015 के पश्चात के विकास कार्यक्रम के उच्च-स्तरीय पैनल ने वैश्विक “डेटा क्रांति” का जो आह्वान किया है वह उचित है।

Indeed, we are rethinking how we define success in development and how we provide trade-related support to developing countries.
Experience has demonstrated that, with forward-looking policies, governments can enhance trade’s benefits and mitigate its negative impact on the poor.
For example, we are helping to simplify and modernize trade procedures through Cameroon’s Douala port, and we have helped the government of Laos to establish an online portal that provides traders with access to all relevant laws, procedures, schedules, and forms from border-management agencies.
It viewed America’s backing for Hosni Mubarak’s fall from power in Egypt – and its subsequent acceptance of the Muslim Brotherhood government – as a betrayal.
And, at the beginning of 2014, Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal and Crown Prince Salman visited Islamabad to renew the two countries’ military agreements on joint arms production.
On the contrary, the Saudis have bankrolled the Pakistani state, and proved a generous host to its current prime minister, Mian Nawaz Sharif, during his long exile following the military coup that toppled his government in 1999.
In the event of an existential threat in the region, in particular a confrontation with Iran, Pakistan would offer the Kingdom a form of deadly protection denied it by the West.
LONDON – Ever since the Al Saud clan established in 1932 the kingdom to which they gave their name, the exercise of power in Saudi Arabia has been shaped by the intrigues and intricacies of royal politics.
To block a Sudeiri restoration, he initially grouped together a number of marginalized, likeminded princes.
Likewise, it is believed that Abdullah’s son, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdul Aziz, will soon replace Saud al Faisal, the world’s longest-serving foreign minister.
Saudi Arabia’s initial response to the fracturing of the regional order was to increase its support for those of its allies – Jordan, Lebanon, and Bahrain – that were still standing, and to turn the Egyptian army into its proxy, leading to the removal of the Muslim Brotherhood’s government.
In Iraq, America has unrivaled control of the air, but can’t hold the ground.
Through the 1990’s, US Vice President Dick Cheney and others made clear that Saddam’s reign threatened America’s oil security by forcing over-reliance on Saudi Arabia.
The US could bomb Vietnam’s cities to rubble, as it can Iraq’s cities, but this solves nothing, claims vast numbers of innocent lives, and confirms the view of Americans as occupiers. 
Bombing Libya did not bring Muammar Qadaffi “in from the cold.” Peaceful diplomacy did the job, showing Qadaffi that reopening diplomatic relations with the West and abandoning Libya’s nuclear ambitions would be advantageous for its own future and that of the country. 
America’s sway in Iraq will be limited, but leaving now would actually make it more effective than it is now, and at much less cost in terms of money and American, allied, and Iraqi lives.
Most people assume that this Commission exists to promote human rights and democratic freedoms.
So totalitarian or authoritarian states – more interested in hiding their own oppression than fairly judging other nations – can easily trigger a sort of political pogrom against any democracy that annoys enough tyrants.
So the goal of all free countries should be that only other free countries are allowed seats on the Commission for Human Rights.
Making a Market for Scientific Research
But if there is no market that impersonally values and rewards scientific achievement, how are good scientific projects to be selected and rewarded without the great waste that often accompanies non-market, bureaucratic solutions to the problems of provision of public goods?
In his 1945 book Science, the Endless Frontier , Bush argued that basic scientific research needs substantial and stable financial support; that support should be potentially available to all researchers; and that peer review should ultimately decide how and to whom funds are allocated.
Countries with politicized universities, or universities where bosses with powerful connections outside academia run the research enterprise, find it difficult to fund the best scientists.
But the benefits of markets can and should be pursued by other means.
Whether in sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East, their populations and governments are more inclined – for political, historical, or cultural reasons – to request European rather than NATO assistance.
Their essential tasks should be movement, information gathering, and, if necessary, combat.
The Capability Development Plan, which the EDA is developing in close collaboration with the EU Military Committee, aims to foster and improve solidarity in terms of capability, which is what Europe needs.
In September 2005, world leaders will meet at the UN to review the progress made since the Millennium Assembly in September 2000, when they pledged to support a set of ambitious objectives - the Millennium Development Goals ­- to help the world's poorest people escape poverty, hunger, disease, and illiteracy.
Communities living in mountainous areas, such as in the Andes, or Central Asia, or the highlands of East Africa, are especially isolated.
Instead, it gives around $15 billion.
Brown is exactly right: let's put Africa and other impoverished regions on a path of sustained economic growth by frontloading the aid during the period until 2015.
But I believe that globalization has enormous potential – as long as it is properly managed.
Growing inequality in the advanced industrial countries was a long-predicted but seldom advertised consequence of globalization.
The problem is that economic globalization has outpaced the globalization of politics and mindsets.
By contrast, taking control of the process holds out the possibility of remaking globalization, so that it at last lives up to its potential and its promise: higher living standards for everyone in the world.
Our world is not only unbalanced, but endangered.
Richer countries do much of the environmental damage.
Three areas can help speed progress:
Another two billion people will be added to global population over the next 25 years - the vast majority in poorer nations - with huge demands for energy and economic growth.
Policymakers seem to be of the same opinion, and not just in developing countries, judging by the EU’s launch of its 2020 flagship last year and the United States’ green energy policy.
Whereas the original concept of IP involved shielding industries from international competition, today’s world requires integrating local productive capacity in global value chains.
Governments should recognize mistakes and withdraw support before it becomes entrenched or too costly.
As more countries embrace IP, competition and conflict is bound to intensify.
There was a time when privatization – allowing individuals to set up individual savings accounts – seemed better than Social Security, which invests in lower-yielding Treasury bills.
Even if there is a problem, it can easily be fixed; spending a fraction of the money that went into Bush’s two tax cuts would have fixed Social Security for 75 years; slight benefit cuts, adjusting the age of retirement, or minor adjustments in the level of contributions could fix the system permanently.
Had Argentina not privatized, its budget would have been roughly in balance.
America’s Social Security program has been so successful in reducing poverty because the poor get back a little more than they contribute, and the rich get back a little less.
But the solution is not nearly as simple as some pundits make it out to be.
China’s tariffs declined precipitously in the late 1990’s, and many of the other inducements were also phased out.
This is a significant effect, even by the standards of China’s superlative growth performance.
It is not clear that advocates of this option have fully comprehended its potentially severe adverse consequences.
The first five months of this year were the warmest on record going back to 1880.
Today’s understanding of Earth’s climate and the human-induced component of climate change is the result of extremely difficult scientific work involving many thousands of scientists in all parts of the world.
Their general approach is to exaggerate the uncertainties of climate science and to leave the impression that climate scientists are engaged in some kind of conspiracy to frighten the public.
Instead of negotiating with vested interests in the backrooms of the White House and Congress, Obama should present a coherent plan to the American people.
The World Bank has long proclaimed its dream of “a world free from poverty.”
As for the World Bank, it does not need to “reposition” itself so much as to root itself in emerging countries, as does the development aid industry in general.
True, private capital flows have surged in the wake of global liberalization and these countries’ privatization schemes.
Its products need to be adapted.
Sri Lanka's bitter war of terror - one that practically invented the infamy of the suicide bomber - had been showing signs of abating of late. But a bitter power struggle between Sri Lanka's President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and a schism among the rebel Tamil tigers, now threatens to reignite the violence.
Could the Malayan military strategy to contain the rebellion have been imported? British experts from the Malayan emergency tried to help the Americans in Vietnam - obviously without success.
Another factor arose from the fact that Tamils, on the whole, had been open to a succession of Portuguese, Dutch, and British administrations from the 16th century onwards, while most Sinhalese lived under their own king in the Kandyan kingdom until the 19th century.
In any case, they never claim to be indigenous to any particular locale, not even in Singapore, where ethnic Chinese make up three-quarters of the population.
And, to become prime minister, Anwar needs UMNO.
Traditionally, people voted for the DAP or the Justice Party to show their displeasure with the National Front.
Urban and middle-class voters such as those in Penang – a predominantly Chinese state with strong opposition sentiment – had always voted to keep the state legislature under the National Front in order to ensure continued funding, while sending opposition candidates to parliament to “pester” the National Front there.
Mali’s population is diverse: desert nomads, notably Tuaregs, in the north, and a majority of sedentary black populations in the south.
In January 2013, these groups formed a convoy of several hundred pick-ups and ATVs, armed with heavy machineguns.
In France, everyone understood and approved.
French troops are now set to return home.
Oil benefits a handful of princes.
TÜBINGEN, GERMANY ­– We are so surrounded by gadgetry nowadays that it is sometimes hard to tell where devices end and people begin.
This could be seen to challenge our notions of personhood and moral agency.
Moreover, humans often control dangerous and unpredictable tools, such as cars and guns.
Nevertheless, this does not raise a new ethical problem.
For example, Christopher Boorse, a philosopher at the University of Delaware, defines disease as a statistical deviation from “species-typical functioning.”
Until recently, Duch was the only one imprisoned, after being exposed in 1999.
My family escaped the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975, the day they claimed victory.
I couldn’t help but think: this was somebody’s daughter, somebody’s son. This was somebody’s mother or sister or brother.
When we start to see each other as less than human, we respond with inhuman acts.
This is, after all, the court’s first test of fairness before the trials of Duch and four of Pol Pot’s other henchmen begin next year.
Indeed, China’s investment rate may have surpassed 50% in 2009.
With an investment rate of 50% and a GDP growth rate of 8%, the incremental capital-output ratio could be higher than six, compared to 4.1 in 1991-2003, implying not only low efficiency, but also the possibility of a significant increase in nonperforming loans.
In 2010, for example, the government may seek to stimulate domestic consumption by making income distribution more favorable to the household sector relative to the enterprise sector, and by providing more public goods to reduce households’ precautionary savings.
But can the TTIP live up to the hype? Tellingly, the High-Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth, which was tasked with identifying the policies and measures that should define the negotiations, has recommended a more conservative approach.
The day after US President Barack Obama announced the launch of the TTIP negotiations, the European Commission released its blueprint for a Eurozone Financial Transaction Tax that would impose new costs on US banks operating in EU markets.
The EU overcame national biases to establish the Single Market by instituting a process of legally binding qualified majority voting, whereby individual member states could be outvoted on specific regulations.
At this rate, current oil output and oil exports now exceed post-invasion predictions.
They still have a long way to go, but significant improvements are already evident.
The new Iraqi government, even supported by US military might, will simply not be able to guarantee a predictable flow of oil, and output will remain quite volatile.
Even if President Bush wins reelection, it is highly unlikely that the US will make another outright grant to a sovereign Iraq.
Managing Risk to Save the Poor
So risk management, by smoothing out bumps in income, can be extremely important in alleviating the effects of poverty.
But crop insurance suffers from what economists call a “moral hazard,” because it reduces farmers’ incentives to ensure the crop’s success.
Today, weather insurance uses an expanded number of sophisticated weather stations and deep knowledge of the science of agriculture to measure weather’s effects on local agriculture.
WASHINGTON, DC – The developing world is experiencing rapid urbanization, with the number of city dwellers set to reach four billion in 2030 – double its 2000 level.
This entails, first and foremost, abandoning the perception of a tradeoff between “building more cities” to accommodate rapid urban growth and “building cities right” to enhance social and environmental outcomes.
For example, Seoul’s population more than tripled from 1960 to 2000.
This amounts to more than ten times the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s total expenditure in 2005, and six times the total value of municipal bonds issued by all local governments and utilities in India in more than a decade.
In April, Ann Wagner, a Republican congresswoman, introduced a bill “to prohibit the Securities and Exchange Commission from issuing rules requiring the disclosure of an issuer’s expenditures for political activities.”
Will parliamentarians become mere spokesmen of corporate interests? Is there any mechanism within the US Constitution, or other constitutions, to prevent this?
The current political game in the US is one in which both Republicans and Democrats compete for corporate money, which they then deploy in expensive campaigns to preserve or increase their power.
But its value is increasingly being questioned, especially in obesity research, where body-composition measurements are proving to be far more relevant.
Although recent studies suggest that high BMI scores do not necessarily increase risk of death, doctors find the BMI categories a useful basis for prevention and treatment.
Although many body components do scale to height by a power close to two, others do not.
But the differences between the metabolically healthy obese and the metabolically abnormal obese are inconsistent.
Of course, monetary expansion should be accompanied by a less contractionary fiscal stance in industrial countries. But the advanced economies’ room for fiscal maneuver is more limited than it was in 2007-2008, and America’s political gridlock has deepened, all but ruling out further stimulus through budgetary channels.
In short, the medium-term benefits that emerging economies could receive from faster growth in the US are now being swamped by short-term risks generated by the “capital tsunami,” as Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has called it.
The man, now sitting next to me, explains with a bit of understatement, “Of course I must continue to have faith in the Chinese legal system, although I must admit that this incident has somewhat dampened my optimism.”
Formal complaints to the justice ministry and the national bar association weren’t even acknowledged, let alone answered.
With little oversight from the central government, and no independent judiciary or a free press to hold them accountable, local authorities in rural areas are often a law unto themselves.
Administrative restrictions on lawyers were tightened to discourage class action or multiple plaintiff suits – typically cases against arbitrary or corrupt government actions – and to facilitate local authorities’ intervention and control over cases.
This is one reason why China has a Taiwan “problem.”
To help finance his communist movement in the 1930’s, Mao squeezed poor peasant families with any assets in the “Red” zone he controlled.
Indeed, in 1950 and 1951 an estimated three million people perished by execution, torture, or suicide.
As a result, his Red Guards destroyed ancient books, priceless antiques, monuments across the land, and nearly all Buddhist monasteries in Tibet.
China’s people have long been ready for this.
This is especially true of our flawed heroes, as we see today with the Chinese Communist Party’s treatment of Mao Zedong.
Mao’s establishment of authority over China, his injection of patriotic pride into a land that had been appallingly sundered and humiliated by external and internal forces for a century and a half, and his romantic legend as a global revolutionary leader – all contribute to the moral and political legitimacy for which China’s leaders search.
I remember being told a story about China that gives credence to the Communist leadership’s generous verdict on Mao.
She witnessed the return of the greed and corruption that she believed had destroyed the Kuomintang in the 1930’s and 1940’s.
Mao made China proud. Deng made it prosperous.
Political failure killed Ché, and illness took Evita's life, possibly saving her from the kind of political calamity that befell her husband a few years later.
His was a theatrical performance staged in a marvelous setting; and his victories were triumphs of beauty and intelligence.
Each time, he moves a little closer toward death.
We have not yet properly mourned, nor reflected upon, our nation's systematic fall into poverty; nor the disappearance of former President Carlos Saúl Menem's mirage of a First World Argentina; nor our institutions' loss of legitimacy; nor our corruption and our violence.
"Show us a good time, bring our hearts some fun."
Among the worst affected was Argentina; the Russian crisis exacerbated a decline in investors’ confidence in emerging markets that culminated in Argentina’s sovereign default less than four years later. Even the US and Europe were not immune, with the collapse of the major hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) fueling anxiety about the viability of many other financial institutions.
Having just emerged from a deep recession, financial disruptions could easily cause Europe to slide back into recession, particularly given the eurozone economy’s close links to Russia via trade and energy.
In any case, US and European leaders must recognize that all sanctions will have costs – many of them unexpected – for both sides. If they are not willing to risk global financial stability in an unpredictable game of chicken with Putin, perhaps it would be wise to re-think the composition of the sanctions that they impose.
Uruguayans still derive immeasurable satisfaction from their soccer successes, including two World Cup triumphs (albeit back in 1930 and 1950) and a semifinal in South Africa in 2010.
To separate political activism from love of the game is a false distinction.
Although football victories have sometimes united bitter opponents, such truces have been all too ephemeral, and usually end soon after the final whistle blows.
At stake is not just an economic calculation, but also a judgment about the outlook of the single currency itself.
For this reason, Poland is sometimes called the “China of Europe.”
One in four employees is on a fixed-term contract or self-employed.
Such a policy was successfully implemented in 2009 and 2010, but the government lacked the funds it needed when economic conditions subsequently deteriorated.
Consider each of those growth factors.
The third engine of growth, total factor productivity, will also be unable to maintain the relentless gains witnessed from the late 1990’s to the mid-2000’s.
Thus, with supply-side factors no longer driving global growth, we must reassess our expectations of what monetary and fiscal policies can achieve.
For many of us who grew up in the Soviet Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe, Margaret Thatcher will always be a heroine.
Thatcher’s embrace of the cause of our freedom was electrifying for me.
That common-sense fusion of family values and fiscal probity set an example for every elected leader who has followed her.
In the 1980’s, the near-simultaneous crisis of communism in the East and social democracy in the West gave her the opportunity to do great deeds.
Thatcher was brave and resolute, but she was not magnanimous. She won famous victories, but showed no generosity to the defeated, in word or deed.
In her famous Bruges speech in 1988, she thundered: “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.”
The aim of all three measures was to restore both state authority and economic dynamism.
She owed her power to a divided opposition and a first-past-the-post electoral system.
Marginalizing Malaria
Yet, while total eradication is beyond the horizon, and new tools are needed to get there, there is much that can be achieved in the near term with our current armory.
This strategy has begun to emerge organically, without prompting from the global community.
LONDON – The new fault line in politics, according to Marine Le Pen, leader of France’s far-right National Front, is between globalists and patriots.
That’s why it must be rebutted, both in France and elsewhere.
The second part of this argument – that the interests of ordinary people have been subordinated to those of the elite – must be heard and responded to. A democracy in which a majority feels neglected or exploited is not sustainable.
Mainstream parties must reclaim the mantle of patriotism and redefine the national interest accordingly.
It is likely that Draghi’s statement will indeed be followed by ECB purchases of Spanish (and Italian) sovereign bonds.
The eurozone can no longer sustain continued uncertainty and high real interest rates in the peripheral countries, so the ECB must provide a solid and credible bridge to the future.
Brilliant Blunders
For a theory to be considered scientific, it must yield specific predictions of future observations or experimental results.
Though Kelvin’s estimate was seriously flawed, the effort remains central to the history of knowledge, because it applied real science – the laws of physics – to what had long been a subject of vague speculation.
Until about a decade ago, the Space Telescope Science Institute adopted a similar policy for allocating observation time for the Hubble Space Telescope.
I always find the question somewhat irritating, perhaps revealing the persistence of an arrogant imperial mindset.
The pound initially fell sharply, and then recovered, while long-term government borrowing rates have risen by around 30 basis points.
That leads to the second problem: the so-called knockouts – the other factors that can change the direction of policy – are clearly matters of judgment, not of fact.
Some argue that it would have been simpler to merge the two, and the unwieldiness of the new means of articulating policy suggests that this might indeed have been a good idea.
But one would surely not start from there if that were the long-term policy aim.
But the sum is larger than $250,000 – the maximum that the government insures in a single account.
But the money market’s size is not the only reason for its fragility. Another problem is that banks are not the only institutions managing it.
The third is to allow this kind of lending only against rock-solid collateral, such as Treasury bonds – not mortgage-backed securities, which can lose value quickly during a crisis, requiring a government bailout.
Singlehandedly, Snowden has changed how people regard their phones, tablets, and laptops, and sparked a public debate about the protection of personal data. What his revelations have not done is bring about significant reforms.
And not only does Canadian law prohibit companies from reporting virtually any information about government requests for data; Prime Minister Stephen Harper has nominated a lawyer who spent his career advising intelligence agencies to serve as an official privacy commissioner, raising the ire of activists.
A year ago, Snowden alerted the world to governments’ egregious violation of people’s privacy.
In those days, if you wanted to know something but did not own an expensive encyclopedia (or your encyclopedia was no longer sufficiently up-to-date to tell you what you wanted to know), you had to go to a library and spend hours searching for what you needed.
For example, if farmers could use it to get more accurate predictions of favorable conditions for planting, or to obtain higher prices for their harvest, they would be better able to afford sanitation, so that their children do not get diarrhea, and bed nets to protect themselves and their families against malaria.
Providing universal Internet access is a project on a scale similar to sequencing the human genome, and, like the human-genome project, it will raise new risks and sensitive ethical issues.
Strident articles critical of the United States, Japan, and Taiwan appear with increasing frequency and receive ever more prominent placement.
As Deng Xiaoping’s reforms evolved, and especially after Deng’s “tour of the South” in 1992, when he signaled permission for high-speed marketization of the economy, China’s media changed beyond recognition.
Even as China’s position in the world continues to rise and its people become more self-confident, China’s history of weakness before the Western powers and Japan sustains a “victim culture” that leaves most Chinese sensitive to any foreign challenge.
The media may make money, but as the recent anti-Japan protests suggests, an excess of such market-driven jingoism can damage a nation’s interests and international standing.
Once those limits were removed, Erdoğan’s governments embraced economic populism and authoritarian politics. Investors’ apparent optimism following the AKP’s victory recalls Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome.
But today it is the police officers who led the corruption probe against Erdoğan who are in jail. Some of the media outlets that supported the probe have been closed down and taken over by the government.
We should not be surprised that the same characteristics can distort markets’ judgment of countries’ governance and political prospects.
The theory underlying the law is that a new set of accredited third-party marketplaces, rather than the overburdened Securities and Exchange Commission (which missed Bernie Madoff’s monster Ponzi scheme), will ensure that entrepreneurs tell the truth, and that investors know what they are buying.
The banks that originated mortgage loans sold their portfolios to investors who didn't really understand what they were buying.&nbsp;
Indeed, many people whom an entrepreneur might have hired will probably become CEOs of competing start-ups.
As on the Internet, so in real life: sometimes friction has a purpose.
These were significant declines – larger one-day drops in the Dow, for example, have occurred only 35 times since January 1950, or about once every twenty months.

At the time of the September 11-12, 1986, event, I thought very hard about what could have caused it.
But then a 2% fall in the Dow on March 13 pushed the VIX back up.
The fundamental features of the post-Cold War geopolitical context are relatively clear.
Even when Americans and Europeans agree in principle, such as on trade, this does not always translate into practice.
Europe must develop greater military capabilities, not to become a major power on par with the US, but so that it can act as America’s partner if it so chooses and to pursue its own goals. A division of labor whereby the US employs military force and Europe uses other policy instruments will gradually divide the US from Europe.
The best guideline is to not permit disagreements to spill over and complicate or infect the relationship.
But transatlantic relations – no less than relations among the 25 members of the EU or the 26 members of NATO – cannot be an all-or-nothing proposition, lest they run the risk of becoming nothing.
A further problem is that these exercises rarely address the implications of national policies for third countries and the international system.
It would probably be too politically sensitive for the Fund to announce by exactly how much different currencies were overvalued and undervalued, and to declare some as seriously misaligned.
Others hesitate, either because they worry about not qualifying or because they remain concerned about the stigma of association with the Fund.
Saving Retirement
Although this would reduce the annual rate of increase in benefits by only about 0.25%, outlays for Social Security and other inflation-indexed programs over the next ten years would be more than $200 billion lower.
Individuals who want to retire as early as 62 can still do so with an actuarially fair reduction in their benefits.
The obvious solution to the current and future Social Security financing problem is to reprise the 1983 legislation by gradually raising the age for full benefits from 67 to 70, with appropriate actuarial adjustments for earlier and later retirements.
CAMBRIDGE – China’s economic policymakers want to shift the country’s production away from exports and heavy industry, and to increase the share of consumption in GDP.
People save so much because insurance is so inadequate.
The Chinese government recently modified the tax law to exclude employers’ contributions to employee pension plans from taxable income and to allow the funds in those plans to accumulate tax-free.
In short, favorable tax treatment of the purchase of insurance for major medical costs would reduce the national saving rate, increase consumer spending, lower the public’s anxiety about the cost of treatment, and increase the quantity of health care.
By contrast, the Maastricht Treaty tasked the ECB with maintaining “price stability,” but left it free to provide its own operational definition.
For the past 12 months, that rate of increase has been about 1.5%.
The Fed could argue that the gap between current and full-employment GDP is larger than the 6.1% unemployment rate implies, owing to the large number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time employment and the sharp decline in the labor force participation rate.
He or she might veto it, but a Republican president after the 2016 election might not.
Any reader who went beyond the headlines soon discovered that the prediction of a zero budget deficit was in fact misleading.
In this case, the overall Greek deficit would be about 15% of GDP, putting its debt on a rapidly exploding path.
Budget deficits and the resulting national debt are important not only in themselves; they also contribute to a country’s current-account deficit, which is the difference between its level of domestic investment by businesses and households in structures and equipment and the amount that it saves to finance those investments.
The program was therefore formally launched on October 1.
Individuals who do not receive insurance from their employers are required to purchase insurance on their own, with low-income buyers receiving a government subsidy.
The preferred alternative for these individuals is to wait to buy insurance until they are ill and are facing large medical bills.
Given the very limited scope and unpredictable nature of the conditions that it would cover, the premium for such a policy would be very low.
CAMBRIDGE – An increasing number of American companies are making plans to shift their headquarters to Europe.
But if it reinvests the profits in Ireland – or in any other country – no further tax must be paid.
A few years ago, the US Treasury Department estimated that shifting to a territorial system would reduce corporate tax revenue by only $130 billion over ten years.
It could repatriate $500 million at any time with no additional tax liability.
But let’s look beyond 2014 and ask what will happen to US economic growth over the longer term.
But things are even better than those numbers imply.
We know what these cost and how much they add to the total nominal value of GDP.
Sonia Gandhi, the head of Congress and the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, has been the power behind the throne since 1998, turning Prime Minister Manmohan Singh into little more than a figurehead. Under her leadership, Congress has pursued a populist agenda that increased transfer payments and reduced India’s annual economic-growth rate to less than 4% in 2013.
Only 60% of the adult population can read and write at an elementary level.
In the current system, the government buys, warehouses, and distributes agricultural products. As a result, an enormous amount of goods are spoiled in storage, while production incentives are misdirected.
The government should crack down on instances of high-level graft and use the new system of cash transfers to limit the scope of petty corruption.
I also stressed that financial markets had become dysfunctional.
US President Barack Obama’s new administration announced a three-year fiscal package intended to stimulate aggregate demand.
Despite the fall in long-term interest rates, house prices reached bottom only in 2012, and the stock market did not rise faster than corporate earnings until 2013.
And debt and equity markets may not continue to respond benignly to the Fed’s wind-down of quantitative easing.
Even by the end of 2016, the midpoint of the range is less than 3%.
So if price stability were the Fed’s only goal, the federal funds rate should now be close to 4%.
With short-term unemployment currently at 4.2%, the inflation rate is indeed rising, and Krueger’s research suggests that it will increase further in the months ahead.
As former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke explained when he launched large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing, that increase in wealth – and the resulting rise in consumer spending – was the intended result.
Another indication of the role of wealth in fueling higher consumer spending is the decline in the household saving rate.
Though the prospect of a rising deficit and national debt in the longer term remains, the two-year budget agreement enacted by the US Congress means that the economy will not be subject to such negative fiscal shocks in 2014 or 2015.
The situation now has diverged from the traditional scenario in which the Fed controlled the banks’ use of reserves by adjusting the federal funds rate (the rate at which banks lend their reserves to one another).
But the region has struggled to regain momentum since the global financial crisis and subsequent recession.
And, despite substantial improvement in the business environment throughout the region, these economies rank behind their EU-15 neighbors on corruption (though they are doing better than other emerging economies, including China, India, Brazil, and Russia).
Led by Poland, the region is an increasingly important location for outsourcing and offshoring work.
Opening them more fully to competition and market incentives would help to raise productivity in these industries.

कुछ देश पहले ही इस तरह के दृष्टिकोण का लाभ उठा रहे हैं। दक्षिण कोरिया के सार्वजनिक और निजी बुनियादी सुविधा निवेश प्रबंधन केंद्र ने बुनियादी सुविधाओं के ख़र्च को 35% तक कम कर दिया है; आज, अधिकारी समीक्षा किए जाने वाली प्रस्तावित परियोजनाओं में से 46% को अस्वीकार कर देते हैं, इसकी तुलना में पहले यह 3% ही था।
यह लक्ष्य अमीर और ग़रीब दोनों प्रकार के देशों में समान रूप से हासिल किया जा सकता है। उदाहरण के लिए, स्विट्ज़रलैंड का पर्यावरण, परिवहन, ऊर्जा, और संचार विभाग संघीय परिषद द्वारा निर्धारित राष्ट्रीय लक्ष्यों को ऐसी एकीकृत बुनियादी रणनीति में शामिल करता है, जिसमें विशिष्ट क्षेत्रों की ज़रूरतों को ध्यान में रखा जाता है। इसी तरह, रवांडा का बुनियादी सुविधा मंत्रालय अन्य मंत्रालयों और सरकारी एजेंसियों की गतिविधियों का समन्वयन करता है और स्रोतेतर वितरण और संचालनों की निगरानी करता है - और सुनिश्चित करता है कि बुनियादी सुविधा रणनीतियाँ पूर्वी अफ़्रीकी समुदाय की क्षेत्रीय एकीकरण की योजनाओं के अनुरूप हों।
International aid is now flowing toward the army, with Saudi Arabia alone pledging more than $3 billion.
Moreover, the army received an outpouring of public support, which is understandable, given the lack of any other unifying institution.
But this inspiring model is under threat, as Lebanon struggles to cope with massive debt and the spread of abject poverty in rural areas, especially among Sunnis.
अम्मान - जब 2011 में अरब जागरण शुरू हुआ, तो इसका प्रमुख लक्ष्य बहुलवाद और लोकतंत्र को आगे बढ़ाना होना चाहिए था - वे कारण जिनकी बीसवीं सदी में अरब दुनिया के पहले, औपनिवेशिक-विरोधी जागरण में उपेक्षा की गई थी। लेकिन, संघर्ष के तीन साल बाद, यह प्रक्रिया केवल अभी शुरू ही हुई है। क्या दूसरा अरब जागरण अंततः अपने लक्ष्य प्राप्त कर सकेगा?

Europe’s Educational Evolution
This means developing differentiated education systems, ranging from vocational schools to doctoral programs, and giving students access to international experience, which can expose them to opportunities beyond national frontiers.
While these new modes of delivery are undoubtedly transforming education, especially higher education, what is happening may be more evolution than revolution.
That is the real challenge facing Europe.
Even if China deliberately acted falsely – endorsing sanctions, while knowing that it would not enforce them – it would have used its support for Chang to tame Kim. Chang’s execution was thus a straightforward challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping – a move that, under normal circumstances, would prompt China to suspend, or at least reduce, its support for North Korea.
The lack of a countervailing ground force in northern China makes it vulnerable to a possible coup by Shenyang, which has already taken advantage of its influence on the North Korean regime to put pressure on China’s leaders.
Under the treaty, Japan renounced its sovereignty claims over the Spratly and the Paracel Islands, but did not reassign them to any single country.
When Japan shifted its diplomatic recognition from the ROC to the PRC, it recognized the latter as the “sole legal government of China.” Given that Japan was not recognizing China as a new state – international recognition of the Chinese state had existed without interruption since the ROC government emerged in 1912 – the PRC effectively accepted the rights and obligations of the previous government.
The US and other extra-regional powers should take advantage of this fact, invoking their latent collective custody of the Spratly and the Paracel Islands in accordance with the San Francisco Treaty, and internationalize separate bilateral diplomatic processes between China and regional claimants.
The species that are so rapidly disappearing provide human beings with indispensable ecosystem services: regulating the climate, maintaining soil fertility, pollinating crops and defending them from pests, filtering fresh water, and supplying food.
It means more pesticides, detergents, antibiotics, glues, lubricants, preservatives, and plastics, many of which contain compounds that mimic mammalian hormones.
To see this phenomenon at work, consider the oil industry.
Our population bomb has already claimed its first casualties.
Sealing itself off from the bracing effects of global competition is sapping Brazil of much-needed momentum, with serious consequences for households, most of which have experienced only modest income growth in recent years.
For decades, Brazil’s economic policy has drawn on the strength of its huge domestic market and protected local industries through a complex system of subsidies, taxes, and tariffs.
One critical difference was the authorities’ emphasis on boosting R&D in these sectors before reducing the government’s direct role.
With improved digital links, Brazil would gain new opportunities to improve productivity and innovation.
We must have the insight to recognize this, and the audacity to say so.
After all, psychology, economics, and evolutionary biology have often claimed that humans share an essentially selfish nature.
But reversing that growth would create other problems; forcing people to compete for diminishing assets and resources would spread unemployment, poverty, and even violence.
MOSCOW – Watching Russia’s worrying trajectory under President Vladimir Putin, many foreign observers ask how a leader who is so apparently driving his country toward the abyss can remain so popular.
The Russian political field has been carefully cleared of all competition.
With the economy showing no sign of recovering the robust growth rates that had bolstered Putin’s popularity in the past, regaining support would have required undertaking the daunting task of fulfilling citizens’ demands for better education, improved health-care services, and more affordable housing.
According to the professional services firm Deloitte, mortgage debt in Russia is 20 times lower, on average, than in the European Union.
May Day Madness
The directive contains safeguards to limit potential abuse of welfare-state benefits during the first five years, including proof of health insurance coverage and a requirement that sufficient “resources” be shown when a residence permit of up to five years is requested.
When the five years of legal residence are completed, an immigrant automatically gains the inalienable right to permanent residence.
The directive on free movement implies a new era of direct migration into West European welfare states.
But that would mean a substantial change in the direction of EU social policies, including revision of the draft constitution.
Each would introduce aggressive targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
The Warner-Lieberman bill on climate change – a piece of legislation which was recently abandoned in the US Senate but is seen as a precursor of future policy – would have postponed the temperature increase in 2050 by about two years.
So we need to reduce by roughly ten-fold the cost of cutting emissions. We can achieve this by spending dramatically more researching and developing low-carbon energy.
He and his followers knew that as long as they remained in Mecca, they would be despised by non-Muslims; their very lives were in danger.
Following these expulsions – most notably by the Spanish and Russian Empires – the concept came to signify not only the pressure to migrate, as during Mohammed’s lifetime, but also an ultimatum from the state: leave or you will be slaughtered.
For the Islamic State’s crude and contrived medievalism, the past is of only instrumental value, to be refashioned in the service of violent conquest and savage repression.
Since 2000, measles cases in the US have been attributed largely to travelers bringing the disease into the country.
Of course, vaccinations can have some side effects, such as a rash, fatigue, headache, or a fever.
Parents argue that vaccination, like all other decisions about how to raise and care for their children, should be their choice.
Paul – who is, ironically, a physician – went so far as to mention the many children he knew who suffered “profound mental disorders” after having had vaccinations, indulging the anti-vaccination advocates who might support him politically, while stopping short of making a false scientific claim. (By his logic, vaccines make people taller, too; after all, nearly every child I have known has grown taller after being vaccinated.)
Is this just because we have been maneuvered into fearing someone worse, a sabre-rattling silovik (past or present member of the security services), like former Defense Minister Sergey Ivanov? Or does Medvedev represent a genuine opportunity to unfreeze the current mini-Cold War between Russia and the West?
Political technology means secretly sponsoring fake politicians like Bogdanov, setting up fake NGO’s and “patriotic” youth movements like Nashi (Ours) to prevent a Russian version of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, and mobilizing voters against a carefully scripted “enemy.”
There are rumors that Sechin’s clan has designs on Russia’s Stabilization Fund, which soaring energy prices have pumped up to over $140 billion.
Europe should avoid repeating the over-reaction of many leaders when Putin succeeded the ailing Yeltsin in 2000.
However, in my family’s next generation, all of my nieces and nephews have a high-school diploma and most have attended university.
Since 2003, this extra money has allowed the government to hire some 410,000 more teachers, add 205,000 classrooms, and distribute 1.8 billion free textbooks.
And in 2012, Turkey raised the minimum period of compulsory education to 12 years.
But the OECD’s 2012 report found that only 15% of lower test scores among Turkish students could be explained by their socioeconomic standing, a better outcome than the OECD average.

गेट्स फ़ाउंडेशन में मैं अपना काफी समय उन बहुत-से तरीकों को समझने में लगाती हूँ जिनसे महिलाएँ और बालिकाएँ विकास कार्य को आगे बढ़ात�� हैं: अपने बच्चों के पोषण, बुनियादी स्वास्थ्य और शिक्षा में निवेश करके - तथा कृषि श्रम उपलब्ध करके भी। अब मैं जो समझ पा रही हूँ वह यह है कि अगर अफ़्रीका किसी कृषि क्रांति की उम्मीद करता है तो इसके देशों को पहले एक मुख्य रुकावट, अर्थात व्यापक लैंगिक अंतर को दूर करना होगा जिसके कारण यह क्षेत्र पिछड़ा हुआ है।

·        Regulators proved unable to forecast and prevent the crisis.
Both nuclear and financial “meltdowns” tend to leave behind “fallout.”
Both Lehman Brothers and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) were able to increase their profits as long as the risk they were willing to accept did not materialize.
So what should be done?
This likely outcome mirrors the initiative for a European or global banking fund to insure against the next financial crisis.
Last month, an unprecedented new low was reached after decades of decline.
In July, 97% of the sheet’s surface was affected.
Less ice reflects less sunlight, and more open ocean absorbs more heat, which is then released into the atmosphere, affecting wind and pressure patterns throughout the northern hemisphere.
Worried about an invasion of migrant workers from the new member states of Central and Eastern Europe, the old EU members have erected high barriers in order to prevent the flow.
Aging populations and lower fertility rates in the new member states might result in even smaller flows.
Nothing comes easy in this world: if the Union cannot manage a multicultural society in Europe, then it ought to prepare itself for permanent stagnation.
As parliamentary and presidential elections loom, everyone wants to figure out just what he is up to.
In the 2000 general election, as the ruling center-right coalition imploded, the PRM received about 20% of the popular vote, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.
For the occasion, Tudor wore a yarmulke and spoke about his "philo-Semitism" for more than two hours . Other PRM representatives, provided with yarmulkes by Tudor, shuffled their feet awkwardly.
After all, they governed together with the PRM from1992 to 1996.
Facing Down Mental Illness
We should no more blame a person for a malfunctioning brain than for a malfunctioning pancreas, liver, or heart.
After a heart attack, for example, the prognosis depends on the presence or absence of depression more than on virtually any measure of cardiac function.
Even in the developed world, it is estimated that only about half of all people suffering from depression are diagnosed and treated.
We need research to develop better treatments for brain disorders in general, and for mental illnesses in particular.
What should the minister do?
In this model, the economy needs a state that eagerly lends an ear to business, and, when necessary, greases the wheels of commerce by providing incentives, subsidies, and other discretionary benefits.
China’s pursuit of a high-saving, large-trade-surplus economy in recent years embodies mercantilist teachings.
As a result, China will have to make important changes to its economic strategy, a necessity for which it has yet to prepare itself.
LONDON – Two hundred years have passed since the battle of Waterloo, where Napoleon’s calamitous defeat made such a huge dent in his country’s self-image that General Charles de Gaulle, in his history of the French army, simply omitted it.
So the key is that the leader has the opportunity to consider alternatives, and choose the right one for his or her country.
But one does not need to be universally liked – or even likable – to be a great leader.
I mean no insult to the House of Luxembourg when I say that it is unlikely that a great leader will emerge from that tiny country, especially given its generally uncontentious politics.
And what of today? The only contemporary European who can lay claim to the mantle of greatness is German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the European Union’s de facto leader.
The latest attempt to halt the war in eastern Ukraine by diplomatic means had an even shorter shelf life than the first attempt last September. The new accord – concluded, like the previous one, in Minsk – de facto recognized that Ukraine has been split by military means.
The sun was shining on Germany and its economy, and Merkel regarded it as her highest duty to maintain citizens' sense of wellbeing by not disturbing them with politics.
And it will be nearly impossible to convince European taxpayers and governments to provide further billions of euros without verifiable guarantees and the necessary reforms.
Germany will have to loosen its beloved purse strings, and France will have to surrender some of its precious political sovereignty.
If she succeeds, she will emerge as the first great European leader of the twenty-first century.
Germany needs both China’s markets and the funds that its government can deploy to purchase German and European bonds.
Hans Kundnani and Jonas Parello-Plesner of the European Council on Foreign Relations view the China-Germany relationship as one that will shape the overall China-EU relationship.
In German political circles in 1990, the very idea would have seemed monstrous and absurd.
Integration with the West took precedence over German unity.
Germany thus had to find a way forward that satisfied both the pacifism of a large majority of the German public and the military requirements of NATO.
It is no coincidence that one of Putin’s central aims is to disengage Germany from the West (or at least to neutralize it).
But it would be naive to think that Russia will give up so easily.
And some are eager to do so.
Likewise, in April, Putin signed legislation simplifying the procedure for Russian speakers in former Soviet republics to obtain Russian citizenship.
MEXICO CITY – Mexico is poised to become Latin America’s economic star in the coming decade.
Until the reform, energy reserves had long been regarded as a national patrimony that could be developed only by Pemex.
The price of gas in the US and Canada is only about half the current price in Mexico (and less than half the price in Europe and Asia).
But, despite such problems, the energy and electricity reforms, and the deeper links with the US and Canada that they imply, promises to accelerate Mexico’s growth rate, boost employment and income, and thus raise Mexicans’ standard of living.
Dollar wages, moreover, have grown much more slowly than in China; As a result, labor is now some 20% cheaper in Mexico in relative terms.
Large firms, oriented toward the global economy, have done quite well, whereas traditional, informal firms – exemplified by the ubiquitous neighborhood tortillerías – have performed poorly while continuing to absorb the bulk of the economy’s work force.
First, external trade and foreign investment on their own cannot lift an economy in the absence of the simultaneous development of productive capabilities at home.
Such collaboration is especially important for the medium-size firms at the cusp of breaking into the big leagues.
He was elected with just 38% of the vote, without a majority in either house of Congress, and with the opposition in control of Mexico City, the capital.
Two years on, success seems to be slipping through Peña Nieto’s hands.
Protests erupted across Mexico.
The trouble with this strategy is what no Mexican president has been willing to acknowledge: the country has never experienced the rule of law.
Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a few hundred miles from the border, the series chronicles the rise and fall of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a methamphetamine tycoon.
The agenda includes an expansion of the tax base to reduce dependency on oil, an initiative to increase competition in media and telecommunications, and a constitutional change that will permit the state-owned oil company Pemex to enter into joint ventures with foreign firms.
Or the US could slip into recession (though modest growth is certainly the central scenario nowadays).
Second, the US, with its incredibly lax restrictions on gun purchases, serves as a veritable arms depot for rich Mexican drug lords.
While tax reform was high on President Felipe Calderón’s agenda during last year’s presidential campaign, electoral reform was not. Instead, it has been imposed upon him by a strange and extreme version of political horse-trading.
Against this backdrop, the ejection of the IFE directors stands out all the more glaringly.
It shouldn’t, and if anyone should know that, it is Calderón.
I pointed out that neither the US nor Mexico was to blame; only Calderón was.
One was deployment of overwhelming force, which the Mexican military lacks.
Cannabis production grew by 300 metric tons over this period, to 15,800 metric tons.
America’s economic success and the collapse of communism fed the narrative.
China is an obvious example of capitalist success and lagging political reform.
So it is not surprising that massive government deficits financed by explosive monetary growth have caused the currency to collapse, with multinationals writing down the value of their Venezuelan subsidiaries each time the official exchange rate is lowered.
A decade ago, it was Domingo Cavallo, who, as Argentina’s finance minister, had pegged the peso to the dollar to bring down the 1,000% inflation that was destroying the economy – and the fabric of society.
Even attempted suppression of free and open debate, or official delegitimization of those with alternative policy proposals, is dangerous.
For example, the notion of modeling children as a durable good seemed crass to some but led Becker to analyze the allocation of parental time and financial resources.
He often looked at broad, long-range trends and data, comparing things like family structure, number of children, and women’s roles in the home and the market across many decades and even from one century to the next, or across very different societies. Cumulatively, his work yielded powerful conclusions, not only explaining trends in birth rates, but also showing that preferences for discrimination led to a tradeoff with profits.
STANFORD – Far too few governments rein in their countries’ bloated welfare states before disaster strikes.
That represents a genuinely remarkable shift.
The other half is returning those who can do so to gainful employment.
The higher the replacement rate and/or dependency ratio, the higher the tax rate needed to pay for the benefits.
STANFORD – Millions of people worldwide watched the athletic achievements at the Sochi Olympics and the opening and closing ceremonies’ majestic portrayals of Russian history and culture. But the cost was immense, the alleged corruption dispiriting, and the contrast with the political situation in nearby Ukraine alarming.
Canada and Mexico were transformed in this way by the 1987 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. On average, 40% of Mexican exports to the United States now have US content.
Water diversion in a difficult drought year, along with Governor Jerry Brown’s proposal for massive new infrastructure to send water south, has heightened tensions.
In the last two years, deficits and debt have stabilized.
None of these reforms has been sufficient to restore the stronger growth that Europe desperately needs.
Italy and Germany are headed toward a ratio of one retiree per worker; without more rapid GDP growth, new immigration policies, higher retirement ages, and efforts to stem the increase in welfare spending, taxes will inexorably rise from already damaging levels.
The politics of this approach will be difficult, particularly in the rich countries; but, structured properly, concerted structural reform could help to restore growth, which would feed back into healthier budgets, more jobs, better balance sheets, and less financial risk.
But the German consumer is a sideshow.
The United States, meanwhile, continues to run a sizeable current-account deficit of around $350-400 billion.
And, while some observers are calling for Germany to “end wage restraint” and thereby encourage higher household spending, this has actually happened already.
Improved regulatory conditions for long-term investments and savings would help.
Clearly, a coordinated effort to limit exchange-rate variations is advisable.
Is Europe bound for a similar fate?
Moreover, while mortgage debt rose sharply in some eurozone countries, the increase was moderate in others and completely absent in Germany.
But, contrary to popular belief, that lesson is not that the central bank should shift swiftly to expansionary monetary policy, as the ECB did at the beginning of the eurozone crisis.
Nonetheless, though monetary policy has not helped to kick-start growth in the eurozone, many observers continue to argue that, in order to help governments address their fiscal challenges, the ECB must launch quantitative easing (large-scale purchases of long-term assets).
Growing Green Cities
If cities are to reduce their carbon footprint, they will need massive investments in their infrastructure. Three-quarters of rich countries’ CO2 emissions come from just four types of infrastructure: power generation, residential and commercial buildings, transport, and waste management.
Banks have traditionally financed a large share of infrastructure outlays.
These obstacles apply to all infrastructure investments.
At a later point, they could move on to raise money in the capital market and fund sustainable infrastructure alongside other investors.
क्योंकि कोनज़ो को प्रारंभ में केंद्रीय तंत्रिका तंत्र में प्रेरक तंत्रकोशिका मार्ग तक सीमित रहनेवाले ऊर्ध्व प्रेरक तंत्रिका कोशिका रोग के रूप में ही माना जाता था, यह सुझाया गया था कि बोध संबंधी प्रभाव न्यूनतम होते हैं। लेकिन बाद में उभर कर आए विद्युत शरीरक्रिया विज्ञान साक्ष्य में यह सुझाया गया कि उच्च-स्तरीय मस्तिष्क कार्यप्रणाली भी प्रभावित हो सकती है। कोनज़ो से प्रभावित बच्चों में तंत्रिका-बोध संबंधी विकृतियों के प्रमाण प्रस्तुत करते समय मेरे सहकर्मी और मैंने कोनज़ो-प्रभावित परिवारों में रहनेवाले कोनज़ो-मुक्त बच्चों के उप-नैदानिक लक्षणों को भी सम्मिलित किया, यह निष्कर्ष स्मरणशक्ति और सीखने के अधिक विशेषीकृत तंत्रिकाबोध संबंधी परीक्षणों के अनुसार उनके कार्य-निष्पादन पर आधारित था।

The goal is a new agreement in 2015 to prevent average global temperatures from rising by two degrees Celsius, the level that the international community has deemed “dangerous” to human society.
There are grounds for cautious optimism.
Last year Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to phase out hydrofluorcarbons, a potent greenhouse gas.
None of this guarantees success.
दूसरा तत्व बुनियादी सुविधाएँ है जिसकी सभी प्रकार के आर्थिक विकास के लिए ज़रूरत होती है: सड़कें, पुल, बंदरगाह, और विद्यालय, और साथ ही बिजली और साफ पानी की विश्वसनीय आपूर्ति। भारत में अपर्याप्त बुनियादी सुविधाएँ होने के कारण उद्योग मजबूर हैं। कारखानों को सुचारू रूप से प्रचालन करने के लिए बिजली की विश्वसनीय आपूर्ति, निविष्टियाँ प्राप्त करने और उत्पादों का वितरण करने के लिए अच्छी सड़कें और रेलवे, और अगर उन्हें उन उत्पादों का निर्यात करना हो तो मालवाहक जहाज़ों के लिए बंदरगाहों और उच्च मूल्य की वस्तुओं और कारोबारी यात्रा के लिए विमानपत्तनों की ज़रूरत होती है। चीन के पास ये चीज़ें भारी मात्रा में हैं। भारत के पास नहीं हैं।


Relief agencies are blocked from operating where they are needed most.
This conflicted view aligns with public perceptions of the UN.
Nonetheless, their intervention came too late for the hundreds of civilians who were killed in the city of Duékoué.
In such an environment, the prospects for diplomacy are dim.
The attackers issued a clear demand: Kenya must withdraw the forces that it deployed two years ago as part of an international effort to drive al-Shabaab out of Somalia and return the country to government rule and a semblance of normal life.
We have heard many such stories in recent days.
It is important to understand what is at stake in this gruesome episode, not only for Kenya but for the region and beyond.
Over the past year, Darfur has spun out of government control.
But the narrow focus on the political and economic implications for Scotland and the UK – or, for that matter, the referendum’s decisive pro-union outcome – should not overshadow one of the more overlooked geopolitical trends of our time: the rise of small countries.
More established small countries also lead the rankings in other metrics.
Add to that measures like the quality of institutions, suitability to thrive in a globalized world, stability of economic output, and level of human development, and one can generate a country strength index, in which 13 of the top 20 performers are small, with the most successful being Switzerland, Singapore, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway.
The risk, of course, is that their voices become drowned out by larger entities, impeding their ability to do what is best for their own citizens.
And America’s income distribution is more unequal than most advanced countries’ – and is trending the wrong way.
What, then, accounts for the US economy’s relatively good performance in the post-crisis period?
Removing structural rigidities is easier said than done.
In the absence of the exchange-rate mechanism, resetting the system to allow the tradable sectors to generate growth involves painful relative deflation, a process that takes longer in a low-inflation environment.
Structural flexibility is not the whole answer; higher levels of public-sector investment would also help to generate sustainable recovery, especially in the advanced countries.
Though one should not conclude from this that growth and inequality are either unrelated or positively correlated, the unqualified statement that inequality is bad for growth does not really accord with the facts.
Intergenerational mobility is a key indicator of equality of opportunity.
In a generally meritocratic environment, outcomes based on creativity, innovation, or extraordinary talent are usually viewed benignly and believed to have far less damaging effects.
This arguably occurred in the 1920s, prior to the Great Depression; it certainly occurred in the US (and Spain and the United Kingdom) in the decade prior to the 2008 crisis.
Inclusion sustains social and political cohesion – and hence the very growth needed to help mitigate the effects of rising inequality.
But public investment is only one component of successful growth strategies.
A weakening euro will help.
A recent analysis for the US suggests that entitlements programs’ liabilities will hit the public budgets in about ten years.
The third missing ingredient is structural flexibility, which is needed for two reasons.
If investment in human capital is to keep up with the changing composition of employment, structural flexibility is needed.
With only a slight lag, complexity became manageable, and global supply chains’ linear model (something produced in country A is consumed in country B) gave way to a more complex model with more fragmented but more efficient supply networks.
This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.
An extreme form of this may be coming in the form of 3D printing, a technology that makes it possible to produce an astonishingly wide and growing range of products by printing them one layer at a time.
Re-localization will be seen everywhere, including lower-income countries.
The world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital.
In fact, the Spanish economy is a classic case of a defective growth pattern followed by a predictable, policy-assisted recovery that is driven (with a delay) mostly by the tradable sector.
In fact, there has been substantial post-crisis re-convergence toward German levels.
Though Spain and Italy are similarly depressed in terms of current growth and employment, especially for the young, two significant differences stand out.
Built-in rigidities impede adaptation and adversely affect growth and employment. 
In such economies, that pattern not only typically depended on leverage; it also enlarged the non-tradable side of the economy and shrank the tradable side.
The hard part of fully realizing potential growth is shifting the composition of domestic demand from consumption to investment without adding leverage.
The speed of structural adjustment is also strongly influenced by how easily employment can shift from an economy’s non-tradable to its tradable side and across segments of global supply chains.
Anyone familiar with China’s structural shifts on the supply and demand side will recognize some similarities with the German case.
Moreover, China’s relationship with the United States is deteriorating, owing to conflict over America’s foreign-policy “pivot” toward Asia and disputes over cyber security. China has already restricted access to its market for some US-based technology firms, and more such actions may follow.
China has no choice but to change its growth model.
Consider the telecommunications-equipment industry, which has been growing at more than 15% annually in the past couple of years.
Such complex structural changes cannot be perfectly synchronized and thus are likely to be accompanied by a dip in growth rates.
The recent downturn in France’s industrial output has created large trade deficits, and is undermining the competitiveness of small and medium-size enterprises.
With no industrial good that still requires a large-scale labor force – and the communications and services industries unable to fill the gap – employment is shrinking and economic growth is stagnating.
Governments, in order to contain the fallout of the crisis, ran up public debt, including in countries whose balance sheets had already been weakened significantly by declining GDP growth.
But, in general, careful analysis of their various facets leads to some understanding of their causes and, in turn, to reasonably promising solutions.
It does not help that China’s economic growth, which provided a powerful boost to the region’s smaller economies in recent decades, has slowed considerably.
The United Nations is preparing its 21st climate conference, to be held in Paris in 2015, with world leaders knowing full well that it, too, will end in failure to conclude a comprehensive global agreement.
The good news is that the global public is increasingly supportive of international intervention in some cases.
Perhaps that will change, too.
Perhaps the strongest reaction came from Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer, who called the proposals “irresponsible and contrary to the interests of the European economy.”
By forbidding investment banks from holding cash deposits, Glass-Steagall helped to support more than a half-century of financial stability after World War II.
To prevent the crash from triggering another Great Depression, governments intervened with massive taxpayer-funded bailouts, causing public-debt burdens to swell further, reaching unsustainable levels in many developed economies.
The eurozone’s member states should never again have to face such costs.
In cities like Beirut and Baghdad, mixed neighborhoods have been homogenized, as Sunni and Shia seek shelter from sectarian attacks and civil war.
This was especially true in Syria, where the Alawite-dominated Baath Party fostered ties to Christians and other small communities by presenting itself as a bulwark of secularism and stability in the face of a supposedly threatening Sunni majority.
In addition to persecuting minorities, the Islamic State has set about erasing all physical traces of religious diversity. Its forces have demolished Sufi shrines, Shia mosques, Christian churches, and ancient monuments they consider to be remnants of a corrupt and profane past.
The recent international conference in London, aimed at supporting reforms in the Palestinian Authority and shoring up support for renewed negotiations with Israel, is one of those preliminary efforts.
Such integration cannot be achieved on a unilateral basis but only by programs adopted by the host and donor countries in co-operation with each other; nor can it be achieved in conditions where there is complete political and administrative separation between the populations which places them under exclusive controls and fails to acknowledge the human needs of community and conviviality.
The Middle East Meltdown and Global Risk
And while the recent nuclear deal with Iran may reduce the proliferation risk, the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran will provide its leaders with more financial resources to support their Shia proxies.
Even in the parts of Iraq now controlled by the Islamic State, oil production continues, with output smuggled and sold in foreign markets.
Third, prolonged misery and hopelessness for millions of Arab young people will create a new generation of desperate jihadists who blame the West for their despair.
The problem is that the conflict is not even close to being ripe for resolution.
If Palestine were a state, it would be judged to have failed.
Simply agreeing to an agenda for follow-up meetings would be an accomplishment.
The most critical barrier for Hamas and others should be a clear commitment to forego armed violence in the pursuit of political ends.
This is one such occasion.
For starters, we are again moving into what Henry Kissinger called the realm of “constructive ambiguity.”
Other senior Fatah officials have been banned from travel outside the West Bank, owing largely to their involvement in nonviolent protests.
One is that, if the current process fails, Obama might issue his own plan, which many expect would be a near-carbon copy of the proposal made by Bill Clinton’s administration in its last days ten years ago.
The coming months will show whether these public postures are negotiable, with obvious consequences for both parties and their relationship with the international community, especially the US.
The results should be read as a cautionary tale for those seeking instant gratification through regime change.
But there is scant evidence to suggest that sanctions have done anything to slow Iran’s nuclear program.
Distrust between Iranians and Arabs is even older than the Shia-Sunni divide; and, in an era that will most likely be remembered as one of weakened leadership throughout the region, Arabs view the nuclear talks as being about something far more fundamental than arms control.
NEW YORK – Amerika Serikat, Uni Eropa, dan beberapa lembaga yang dipimpin negara Barat seperti Bank Dunia berulang kali bertanya mengapa Timur Tengah tidak bisa memerintah sendiri.
Perilaku yang sama masih dijalankan sampai hari ini: pencopotan pemimpin Libya, Muammar Khadafi di tahun 2011, penggulingan pemimpin Mesir, Mohamed Morsi di tahun 2013, dan kini perang di Suriah melawan Presiden Bashar al-Assad yang masih berlangsung.
Pendekatan yang diterapkan sekarang melalui pembentukan koalisi yang dipimpin Amerika Serikat disebut “coalitions of the willing” tidak hanya gagal; tapi berarti bahkan tujuan-tujuan yang valid seperti menghentikan ISIS (Islamic State) dihambat oleh persaingan geopolitik.
Tanpa pendidikan berkualitas tinggi, sedikit peluang bagi terwujudnya kemakmuran ekonomi dan stabilitas politik di negara manapun.
The consequences are being felt most acutely in the Levant, where improved transport and trade reforms had strengthened economic ties between Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
The consequences for the region’s political economy are profound. Whatever weak constituency existed in support of regional trade has been marginalized by conflict.
RIYADH – Analysts the world over are assessing the situation in the Middle East in 2012 by listing the region’s “winners” and “losers.”
The victims of the conflicts in Syria, Iran, and Palestine; the friends and families of the victims; those who hope for peace: all lost.
Unlike some conflicts in the region, this is a case with a clear and simple solution.
Did the Americans defeat Saddam Hussein, and did more than 100,000 Iraqis die in the process, so that their country could become a puppet of the hostile Iranian regime? Iran’s meddling in Bahrain, Kuwait, Yemen, and other Gulf states must end as well.
The choice is simple: Do we want to be winners or losers?
Otherwise, the global development agenda could lose its relevance, and thus its grip on stakeholders.
In Bangladesh, for example, just 13% of households that receive remittances from abroad are below the poverty line, compared to 34% of non-remittance-receiving households.
Typically, development experts regard migration as a sign of failure: if development policies work, people should not want to move.
Such an agenda includes simple measures, like reducing fees for visas, and more complex reforms, like allowing migrants to switch employers without penalty and increasing the proportion of migrants who enjoy legal protections and labor rights.
But once glasnost let people say what they thought, many people said, “We want out.”
After all, he wanted to reform communism, not replace it.
Eventually, even the military became aware of the tremendous burden caused by imperial overstretch.
At the end of the twentieth century, the major technological change of the third industrial revolution was the growing role of information as the scarcest resource in an economy.
But it is also a mistake to discount the importance of leaders with humanitarian values.
इस स्थिति का सामना करने के लिए दृढ़ संकल्प के साथ उपाय करने होंगे. इनके बगैर पानी की मांग अनेक समाजों की खुद को परिस्थिति में ढालने की क्षमताओं को पार कर जाएगी. नतीजतन बड़े पैमाने पर आबादी का विस्थापन होगा, अर्थव्यवस्था ठप पड़ जाएगी, अस्थिरता व हिंसा फैलेगी तथा राष्ट्रीय व अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा को नया खतरा पैदा हो जाएगा.
अनेक कानूनी प्रावधान संयुक्त रूप से तथा मिलजुल कर लागू किए जा सकते हैं: रामसर कन्वेंशन ऑन वेटलैंड्स, यूएन कन्वेंशन टू कम्बैट डेजर्टिफिकेशन तथा यूएन फ्रेमवर्क कन्वेंशन ऑन क्लाइमेट चेंज कुछ ऐसे ही समझौते हैं. संयुक्तराष्ट्र वाटरकोर्सेज कन्वेंशन के विलंबित अमल को इसमें शामिल देशों के लिए अवसर के रूप में देखा जाना चाहिए. इससे उन देशों को प्रोत्साहन मिलना चाहिए जो अभी सहकारिता समझौतों से बाहर हैं कि वे इन मुद्दों पर गंभीरतापूर्वक कार्य करें.
Worse still, the economic, territorial, and military insurgency of the FARC guerrillas was growing stronger.
Likewise, although Uribe’s government approved the extradition of 304 Colombian nationals and 11 foreigners (most to the US) between 2002 and 2005, drugs-linked organized crime continues to thrive and expand in Colombia.
The implicit immunity from prosecution these groups received in exchange for their demobilization has done little to help.
The setback to the fragile gains of recent years, particularly in Africa, threatens to return millions of people to the extreme poverty from which they had just managed to escape.
Moreover, 536,000 women a year die in childbirth, and maternal health is also the one MDG progress towards which has stagnated since the targets were established 10 years ago.
By the end of 2010, four million African women will be screened, and tri-therapies treatment provided to 500,000 pregnant women worldwide.
Trials of war criminals were once serious business.
Today there are two plausible ways to proceed against a deposed tyrant.
The ICTY did make several foundational decisions under the leadership of Antonio Cassese.
In the South African proceedings the most important question was not the future of the defendant but the past of the victims.
The tragedy of the Milosevic and Hussein trials is that the “i”s of history were not yet fully dotted and history itself was on trial.
Until Tony Blair and Robin Cook became, respectively, Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom in 1997, four years after the ICTY was established, NATO troops in Bosnia failed to arrest indicted suspects even when they ran into them.
Jean Kambanda, former Prime Minister of Rwanda, pled guilty to crimes against humanity and genocide and is serving a life sentence in prison.
The ICTY’s mission is as valid and as vital as ever: to show that the era of impunity for some of humanity’s worst crimes is coming to an end.
Inspired by Friedman’s ideas, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and many other government leaders began to dismantle the government restrictions and regulations that had been built up over the preceding decades.
Let the government simply enforce property rights and contracts, and – presto! – markets can work their magic.
No single central authority coordinated their actions; that feat was accomplished by the magic of free markets and the price system.
China’s government has subsidized, protected, and goaded its firms to ensure rapid industrialization, thereby altering the global division of labor in its favor.
Markets are tools that, relative to the alternatives, happen to have great strengths with respect to incentives, efficiency, and innovation.
In a decentralized structure, redundancy tends to be undersupplied in the process of local optimization.
These differential outcomes reflect distinctive combinations of market forces and social contracts.
Experience in developing and advanced countries alike suggests that states with substantial and healthy balance sheets are better positioned to deal with today’s stability, distributional, and sustainability challenges.
Within today’s booming world economy, most developing countries have been growing rapidly.
Indeed, the recent boom in some parts of the developing world shows exactly that.
The same is true of foreign direct investment (FDI).
It also includes creating the regulatory and institutional framework that markets require to function well, providing necessary public goods and guaranteeing the fairness of rules.
China’s Measured Embrace of India
Partly motivated by a desire to counterbalance China’s rising geopolitical influence, Japan and the US have sought to draw India into a multilateral alliance consisting of democratic countries in the Asia-Pacific region.
Xi is confident that China can understand and satisfy many of Modi’s needs better than regional rivals like Japan.
As major aid providers and investors in Afghanistan, China and India also have common interests in stabilizing that country, and countering religious extremism and terrorism after NATO troops leave.
Indeed, the greater Middle East is becoming an ever greater focus of Chinese foreign policy.
To this end, Prime Minister Li Keqiang has proposed an economic corridor linking China to Pakistan, and has spoken of other corridors running through Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar.
Specifically, western provinces like Ningxia and Qinghai, which have substantial Muslim communities, could benefit from deeper links with Arab economies.
This is a daunting task, but it is one that can not only help to secure China’s long-term future, but perhaps bring greater weight to bear in resolving the region’s immense challenges.
The conventional wisdom is that the threat of prosecution serves Xi’s goals of consolidating power and compelling the bureaucracy to implement economic reforms that run counter to its interests. The two prongs of Xi’s political strategy – cleansing the Party and reinvigorating China’s economy – are thus complementary and interdependent.
What it does have is the capacity to influence ordinary Chinese – making them a valuable addition to a pro-reform coalition.
Outside China, the prevalent view among business leaders is that President Xi Jinping’s new administration has consolidated its power and acquired enough authority to push through far-reaching economic reforms.
Indeed, the fight against corruption is at war with itself, because Xi is simultaneously seeking to buttress one-party rule.
Only by mobilizing pressure outside the party-state can these insiders be forced to accept some of the decentralizing and liberalizing reforms that China’s economy needs.
Though these stories have yet to implicate Zhou directly, it will be only a matter of time before the Chinese government officially charges him with corruption.
Liu made his fortune with Zhou Bin’s help.
As of now, one minister, two provincial vice governors, one vice minister, and several senior executives in state-owned oil companies have been detained.
The truth is that, while Deng deserves appreciation for having brought China back from the abyss of Maoism, his approach – “Dengism,” or authoritarian developmentalism – is now impeding China’s prospects.
With leadership positions allocated – often for life – on the basis of personal connections, rather than merit, he understood that the system suffered from gross inefficiency, risk aversion, and a lack of technical expertise.
Its greatest political failure is its resistance to the democratic reforms needed to constrain that power.
One hopes that he continues to emulate Deng, without allowing his approach to become distorted by Dengism.
The unseemly race to recruit princelings starts at the world’s leading colleges and universities.
A place awarded to a less-qualified princeling is a place denied to a more qualified applicant.
In China, by contrast, pervasive corruption, the absence of a free press, and state capitalism mean that princelings’ conduct is unconstrained – and typically shrouded in secrecy.
Now she, and Cataphora, are applying those same analytics to a different market: people who want to analyze their own e-mail correspondence (and eventually other content) to see a reflection of their interactions with others.
Digital Mirror – along with a book written by Charnock called E-Habits, which serves as a kind of extended documentation – can be used for self-analysis or analysis of the local ecosystem.
For example, in a real-world office, you can see who goes out to lunch together or gossips at the water cooler, who has a line in front of their door, and so on.
Missile defense has suddenly emerged as a divisive issue in Europe.
Third, America underestimated the role of public opinion in Poland and the Czech Republic.
As Eastern European countries become more closely integrated into the EU, they increasingly have to calculate the impact of their policies on relations with Europe.
This approval cannot be taken for granted.
The US representatives were perplexed; the Europeans were shocked.
But we are light years away from a new Cold War.
Apparently, the US can’t decide whether to treat Russia as a rival power or a difficult partner.
However important NATO may be, it would be a dramatic admission of its own helplessness and insignificance if the EU were to remain silent on this crucial issue for Europe’s future.
No European country – not even the Big Three (France, Great Britain, and Germany) – can any longer assert its central foreign policy interests alone, outside of the common European framework.
This is obviously a hefty price tag – at least a 50% increase in the total cost of the EU – and it will likely be much higher (the Commission has previously estimated the cost to be double its current estimate).
In other words, if Barroso fears costs of 20% of GDP in the year 2100, the 0.5% payment every year of this century will do virtually nothing to change that cost.
It stops us from focusing on long-term strategies like investment in energy R&amp;D that would actually solve climate change and at a much lower cost.
The inaction argument makes us spend vast resources on policies that will do virtually nothing to deal with climate change, thereby diverting those resources from policies that could actually make an impact.
The rise of populist political parties of both the left and the right across the continent attests to popular frustrations and fears.
The challenge of caring for, employing, and integrating such numbers will soon run up against the limits of physical capacity, financial resources, and public tolerance.
Turkey would receive financial and military assistance in exchange for asserting greater control over its borders, while the question of Turkey’s long-term relationship with Europe would be set aside until the crisis passed.
NAIROBI – My mother, like her mother, her grandmother, and so on, was born into poverty in the rural village of Rarieda, Kenya.
But few have stopped to consider this shift’s implications for families like mine.
The world’s enduring perception of Africa as a village exacerbates slum dwellers’ plight, keeping them off the global development agenda.
For the sake of the millions of people like my mother – and, more important, for the sake of their children and grandchildren – we must fulfill the promise that attracts the poor to cities in the first place.
They also work hard to make a living in a country where median household income has declined to a level last seen in the mid-1990’s.
Instead, special interests compete for influence through campaign contributions and other forms of political donations.
According to a recent report on the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, prepared by Better Markets, an advocacy group that pushes for stronger financial reforms, the cost to the US economy of the financial crisis – caused by financial institutions’ reckless risk-taking – amounts to at least $12.8 trillion.
If only Romney had turned popular disdain for subsidies against the global megabanks, he would now be coasting into the White House.
More than 11 million additional jobs are needed to return the US to its pre-recession employment level.
With the possible exception of the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts, these changes would take considerable time to implement.
Based on what Romney has told us, we can conclude that his plan would exacerbate the public-investment deficit as well.
His plan would pay for lower income-tax rates by eliminating tax deductions like those for charitable giving and mortgages, while maintaining tax preferences for saving and investment.
President Barack Obama’s re-election marked a victory, limited but unmistakable, for the cause of fact.
When the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a report in October showing that the national unemployment rate remained “essentially unchanged at 7.9%,” Republican operatives sought to discredit the highly respected BLS.
“President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans,” Romney told the Republican convention, and then paused, with the expectant smile of a comedian waiting for the audience to catch on to the joke.
Obama swung into action, now not just a suspect candidate but a trusted president whose services were sorely needed by the battered population of the East Coast.
The private sector, while central in a modern economy, cannot ensure its success alone.
Democracies rely on a spirit of trust and cooperation in paying taxes.
Indeed, it might be a Nixon-in-China moment: a wealthy politician at the pinnacle of power advocating higher taxes for the rich could change the course of history.
Romney may not be a tax evader; only a thorough investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service could reach that conclusion.
Most damaging, the ouster of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood government had deprived Hamas of its lifeline of supplies and armaments.
Such achievements shattered the indomitable image of the Israeli army, exposing a weakness that other radical Islamist groups may attempt to exploit.
Given Hamas’s leading role, it will be held accountable not only for the success of Gaza’s reconstruction, but also for any further delays in Palestinian reconciliation.
LONDON – My career as a businessman in Africa has turned me into an activist for better, cleaner government and for the rule of law.
This is the rule of law in action at the local level, and it is building, often from scratch, a culture in which disputes are settled peacefully and benefits distributed transparently.
The Changing Development Order
A similar picture prevails globally.
We have barely scratched the surface in integrating the efforts of development finance institutions (DFIs) with private and philanthropic initiatives, which could make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
Traditionally, development flows were unidirectional, going from the wealthy North to the impoverished South.
Models of Madness
Our children are labeled, too.
How did this simplistic, certainly unscientific, and frequently damaging approach gain such dominance?
Naturally, they encourage us to diagnose eating, sleeping, or feeling too much (or too little) as illnesses requiring a chemical cure.
The Misrule of Law
Currently, the anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of Putin’s regime, is being prosecuted for allegedly conspiring to embezzle from a state-owned timber firm, while Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in prison after accusing several Russian officials of large-scale embezzlement, is being tried posthumously on conspiracy charges.
This disturbingly common disconnect between official words and deeds devalues the rule of law in the eyes of the public.
For example, while Interpol recently rejected Russia’s request to pursue the investment banker William F. Browder (a fierce critic of the Russian government since the death of his lawyer, Magnitsky), it should apply Article 3 of its constitution, which bars it from participating in political matters, much more scrupulously.
MUNICH – At the World Economic Forum’s recent annual meeting in Davos, I participated in a panel of defense leaders to discuss the future of the military.
The second, which culminated in World War I, was driven by massed firepower, and is expressed in the saying, reportedly coined at the Battle of Verdun in 1916, “artillery conquers, infantry occupies.”
The insurgents in eastern Ukraine are fighting alongside Russian troops (bearing no insignias).
In China, for example, military planners developed a strategy of “unrestricted warfare” that combines electronic, diplomatic, cyber, terrorist-proxy, economic, and propaganda tools to deceive and exhaust US systems.
Modernization à la Carte?
But human rights and the rule of law began to re-emerge as a theme of Western policy, especially in the wake of the Helsinki Conference on European Security and Cooperation and its use by the administration of US President Jimmy Carter, as well as by numerous non-governmental advocates protesting the treatment of Soviet dissidents.
In particular, China’s breathtaking economic success seems to point to the existence of viable authoritarian alternatives to the Western idea that freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and the market economy are bound together.
Before too long, Russia’s “managed” (read: authoritarian) modernization will also have to allow for the rule of law and a functioning separation of powers, or the country will remain dependent on oil and gas prices and mired in a brutal struggle for power, influence, and money.
Modernizing the Middle East’s Economies
Indeed, oil rents eventually weaken state institutions, and this hollowing out of the state often gives rise to growing discontent. 
So what, then, are the possible policy options? The absence of a modern industrial base diminishes the WANA economies’ ability to absorb the surplus generated by oil revenues.
Its 2008 report Making the Law Work for Everyone argues that legal empowerment is not about aid, but about policy and institutional reforms that expand the legal opportunities and protection of the poor.
To be sure, China’s leaders fêted Modi in style.
Four years later, China revived its long-dormant claim to Arunachal Pradesh, and has since breached its border several times.
Many of the deals Modi made with business leaders in Shanghai – supposedly worth $22 billion – entail Chinese state-owned banks financing Indian firms to purchase Chinese equipment.
Without a new approach, the Sino-Indian relationship seems doomed to remain highly uneven and contentious.
Unlike Hans, he is genuine and dependable; they end up together.
It enjoys a significant amount of political independence. And it has not been shy about using its considerable operational autonomy.
And, only two weeks ago, an outgoing Fed governor, Jeremy Stein, declared that the Fed is in the middle of a policy transition that renders its guidance to markets “more qualitative,” “less deterministic” and, therefore, less precise.
So why have financial markets been behaving as if they were in a world of their own?
In order to kick-start progress, ECB President Mario Draghi has proposed a grand policy bargain to European governments: if they implement structural reforms and improve fiscal flexibility, the central bank will expand its balance sheet to boost growth and thwart deflation.
In India, the question is whether newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi will move decisively to fulfill voters’ high expectations for economic reform before his post-victory honeymoon is over.
In the next few months, the buoyant optimism pervading financial markets may prove to be justified.
And emerging economies will be anchored by China’s slower but still-robust 7% annual growth.
Meanwhile, exchange-rate appreciation is beginning to undermine exports in the eurozone’s core countries, particularly Germany, which has been the regional growth engine in recent years.
In China, for example, this involves less reliance on exports and public investment, and more on the private components of domestic aggregate demand.
The 2008 global financial crisis left the US economy mired in a low-level equilibrium, characterized by sluggish job creation, persistently high long-term and youth unemployment, and growing inequalities of income, wealth, and opportunity.
This is not to say that there has been no economic or financial progress in 2013. After all, economic growth, while unnecessarily held below potential by Congress (and vulnerable to decline if Congress is not careful), has again outpaced that of Europe.
The resulting sense of political drift and dysfunction has been exacerbated by the poor rollout of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) – a massive, avoidable distraction that has been allowed to cast doubt on this landmark initiative.
Mexico’s Breakout Moment?
As a result, there are only a few good historical examples – including China, Poland, and South Korea – of successful structural reforms.
They also note that Mexico’s impressive accomplishments in terms of macroeconomic stabilization, while necessary, have not proved sufficient to unleash the country’s growth potential.
Fortunately, the government has room for countercyclical policy, and has already responded with more accommodating fiscal and monetary policies.
But, rather than deploy their abundant cash in new investments to expand capacity and tap new markets – which they have been very hesitant to do since the global financial crisis erupted – many companies have so far preferred (or have been pressured by activist investors) to give it back to shareholders.
Successful innovation today is a lot less about financing and much more about finding the “killer app.” As a result, many companies, less convinced that “normal” innovation yields big payoffs, end up investing less overall than they did before.
NEWPORT BEACH – History is full of people and institutions that rose to positions of supremacy only to come crashing down.
With other policymaking entities sidelined by an unusual degree of domestic and regional political polarization, advanced-country central banks felt obliged to act on their greater operational autonomy and relative political independence.
In the eurozone, fiscal integration and pro-growth regional initiatives have essentially stalled, as have banking initiatives that are outside the direct purview of the European Central Bank.
But central banks cannot do it alone.
Yet national political support for the Bretton Woods institutions – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – seems to have reached an all-time low, undermining the global economy’s ability to meet its potential and contributing to geopolitical insecurity.
And, just a few weeks ago, the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) acted to bolster a currency-reserve pool to help ease short-term liquidity pressures and to establish their own development bank – a direct challenge to the IMF and the World Bank.
Another challenge to the international monetary system lies in the proliferation of bilateral payment agreements.
The repeated rejection by the US Congress of a much more limited set of reforms – which was approved by most other countries in 2010-12, imposes no incremental financial obligations on the US, and implies no reduction in America’s voting power or influence – is a case in point.
The Brothers dismiss those who have demonstrated in the streets during the past three weeks as Mubarak sympathizers.
In addition, the mosque of al-Azhar is promised an advisory role in Islamic legislation.
America’s main priority now is to ensure that the peace treaty with Israel is maintained.
Will it embrace a new Islamic authoritarianism, or build the democracy that Egyptians have risked their lives to secure?
Another obstacle to a peace agreement has been the division between Hamas-controlled Gaza and the Fatah-controlled West Bank.
Paradoxically, the discerning Palestinian observer may find comfort in America’s failure to stop Israel from expanding its settlements (and thus effectively annexing a growing share of Palestinian land), for it ends the charade on which the peace process has been based.
It is time, therefore, for the US to rethink its policy toward the Israel-Palestine conflict.
In this environment, sober, informed voices, like that of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank of central banks, should also be given a fair hearing.
And, under the public spotlight, some central bankers have sought to downplay the BIS’s assessment, arguing that it is all too easy to issue far-reaching policy recommendations when one suffers none of the consequences should one’s prescription turn out to be wrong.
Indeed, it serves policymakers well by challenging, debating, and perhaps swaying opinion.
The protests of April 2009 were triggered by the Communist Party’s claim to have won a third consecutive term in power, following an aggressive election campaign with widespread abuses.
Reckless populist promises left a gaping 16%-of-GDP budget deficit.
We will also sign a far-reaching free-trade agreement with the EU.
This makes Moldova the only post-Soviet state (aside from the Baltic countries) with an uninterrupted cycle of transfers of power through elections since 1991.
All of this points to the costly skills mismatch at play in today’s economy.
One-third of employers never interact with education providers, while only 15% do so once a month or more.
Governments can play a critical role in collecting the data needed to determine which skills are in demand and what kind of training is effective.
If the world continues on its current course, labor-market imbalances will worsen significantly in the coming years.
Even the most stability-obsessed countries have made unexpected moves.
Anticipating falling prices, households could postpone their consumption decisions, and companies could defer investment, pushing the economy into a downward spiral from which it would be very difficult to escape.
The "divergence" of economic performance and monetary policy among three of the world's most systemically important economies – the eurozone, Japan, and the United States – has added another layer of confusion for the rest of the world, with particularly significant implications for small, open economies.
But, given the danger that this poses, one hopes that they succeed.
Keynes's dictum has become the ruling wisdom of monetary policy (one of his few to survive).
Today, the collapse in the price of crude oil is probably the most significant factor driving inflation below target, just as in 2011 it was the rise in oil prices that drove it above target.
So what happens to the recovery if we fall into what is euphemistically called “negative inflation"? Until now, the consensus view has been that this would be bad for output and employment.
Thus, price deflation means debt inflation; and a higher debt burden means lower spending.
The implications go well beyond academia and policy circles.
Let me explain by going back to the end of the inflationary 1970’s, when President Jimmy Carter appointed Paul Volcker to lead the Fed.
All of this risks serious skill atrophy.
If the target is missed repeatedly, as it has been, the governor must send a public explanatory letter to the government.
Money for Nothing
This increase has no separate climate effect, since we’ve already promised to cut emissions by 20%. However, it does manage to make a poor policy decision dramatically worse.
The last €500 million could fund an eight-fold increase in research and development aimed at improving CO2-efficient energy technologies, enabling everyone in the long run to reduce emissions much more dramatically, and at much lower cost.
The EU’s goal of a 20% reduction by 2020 is an incredibly expensive way to signal good intentions.  But wouldn’t we rather do real good?
This is also roughly the amount needed to fill the vast infrastructure gap that is preventing the world from addressing critical developmental challenges – from rapid urbanization to climate change and job creation.
First, developing countries must build effective institutions while enforcing good governance, transparency, and accountability. They must fight corruption, combat organized crime, and implement effective tax systems, which is even more critical in resource-rich countries.
Our work will benefit enormously from the current push for more international cooperation in curbing illicit financial flows.

अक्षय ऊर्जा के उत्पादन में वृद्धि से यह स्पष्ट हो गया है। लोग स्वच्छ ऊर्जा चाहते हैं, प्रौद्योगिकी उपलब्ध है और लाभदायक हैं, और, लाखों लोगों को विश्वसनीय बिजली प्राप्त न हो सकने के कारण, ऊर्जा के अक्षय स्रोतों का उद्भव एक संजीवनी के रूप में है। पवन और सौर ऊर्जा की वैश्विक क्षमता 2009 के स्तर से बढ़कर तीन गुना हो गई है, और नवीकरणीय ऊर्जा अब विश्व की विद्युत आपूर्ति के पांचवें हिस्से से अधिक उपलब्ध करती है।
One of the EU’s main architects, Jean Monnet, a French diplomat and economist, spent much of World War II in Washington, DC, as a negotiator for the European allies.
The other ideal was eternal peace.
The European ideal has parallels in other parts of the world.
In this, too, he was a man of his time.
In fact, it is the typical sentiment of a technocrat who lacks political sense.
Is Finance Too Competitive?
By contrast, if the industry were open to new players, potential entrants, with everything to gain and little to lose, would have a strong incentive to unleash the waves of “creative destruction” that Schumpeter thought so essential to human progress.
An analogy may be useful.
But patents are ineffective in some industries, like finance.
The problem was not with the innovation, but with how it was used – that is, with financiers’ incentives.
Why is this bailout happening in the world’s most avowedly capitalist country? Don’t venerable capitalist principles imply that anyone who believed in the real estate bubble and who invested in Fannie and Freddie must accept their losses?
Similar housing booms in many other countries are now ending, and they may face the pain – and the moral dilemmas – that the US economy is now experiencing.
People’s reactions to these events depend on their emotions and their sense of justice.
The gnawing problem is one of “good faith.”
A perception of unfair treatment can be deadly to economic growth, because it means that people will lose trust in businesses, and hence be less willing to offer to them their precious capital and labor.
In a triumph for parliamentary democracy, the motion passed without dissent.
Nowadays, China has its own animal-rights campaigners, and there are signs that their message is beginning to be heard.
The problem does not lie with voters, who, in states like Florida, Arizona, and California, have shown that they want farm animals to have better protection than the animal industries typically provide.
What Drives Moral Progress?
Everybody’s life is just as important as anybody else’s.”
In short, a stronger sense of empathy spurs moral progress.
In this sense, the notion of “us versus them” has been fundamental to human evolution, and it continues to shape our interactions.
Plato would reject this view.
Traditional morality faded away as technology multiplied productive power.
Theological language that might have decried the credit crunch as the “wages of sin,” a come-uppance for prodigious profligacy, has become unusable.
Whereas guarding against uncertainty had traditionally been a moral issue, hedging against risk is a purely technical question.
The prudential supervision regime initiated by the Bank of Spain in response to the Spanish banking crises of the 1980’s and 1990’s shows what a sensible middle way might look like.
The possibility of being unable to put food on the table fills parents with a deep sense of foreboding.
For example, access to international food supplies allowed Saudi Arabia to abandon its 30-year program of subsidies for domestic wheat production.
Most people are surprised to learn how shallow international grain markets truly are.
To put it simply: when it comes to tackling food security, trade is part of the solution, not part of the problem.
Nuclear deterrents could have failed at any moment.
It remains to be seen whether today’s leaders will do the same.
In 1989, incredible changes that were deemed impossible just a few years earlier were implemented.
From Terror to Counterterror in North Africa
According to the Moroccan North Observatory of Human Rights, only 16 Moroccan jihadists traveled to Syria and Iraq in the first six months of this year.
And, indeed, as the UN report underscored, Daesh remains skilled at using social networks to attract and indoctrinate young people across the region.
To confront terrorism in North Africa and beyond, Morocco will have to continue to address the threat from all angles: intelligence, law enforcement, and social policy.
For these activists, such linkages were intended to maintain control over women, and were part of Moroccan society, not Islam.
The growing significance of the veil also highlighted important differences between men and women in Morocco.
Thus, in Morocco, it is difficult to speak of separate “secular” and “Islamic” feminisms.
With President Putin recently completing a Middle East tour to flex Russia’s diplomatic muscles and sell arms, now is a good moment to assess his country’s influence in the region.
There is a growing fear in Moscow that the US administration is now looking at Russian companies with similar ties to Iran and its nuclear ambitions.
But the only thing that Russia appears to be concerned about is that, whatever successor regime emerges, it is willing to do the Kremlin’s bidding.
वाशिंगटन, डीसी – मलेरिया के ख़िलाफ़ लड़ाई में जो लोग अगली कतार में हैं उनके लिए इस परजीवी के ख़िलाफ़ टीके के विकास की ख़बर रोमांचक घटना है। 2013 में इस रोग से 584,000 मौतें हुई थीं, जिनमें से लगभग 90% उप-सहारा अफ्रीका में हुई थीं; मरने वालों में 78 प्रतिशत पांच वर्ष से कम उम्र के बच्चे थे। जिन 97 देशों में मलेरिया महामारी है, उनमें यह इलाज और देखभाल तक सीमित पहुंच वाले उन ग़रीब लोगों की आर्थिक उत्पादकता को तहस-नहस कर देता है जो उसे सबसे कम बर्दाश्त कर सकते हैं।
इसके अलावा किसी टीके की प्रभावकारिता बनाए रखने के लिए तीन शुरूआती खुराक़ों के बाद एक बूस्टर देने की ज़रूरत होती है। इसके बिना कारगरता घट कर असुरक्षित स्तरों तक चली जाती है। क्या सरकारें सचमुच इस पर लाखों डालर ख़र्च करना चाहेंगी?
WASHINGTON, DC – The financial crisis that began in 2007 has been persistently marked by muddled thinking and haphazard policymaking.
The automakers are also the backbone of American manufacturing, driving advances in manufacturing technology that will be needed if America is to be a world leader in the coming “green” transportation revolution.
Opposition to the bailout is bringing back to the surface the worst of the conservative economic thought that got America and the world into this mess in the first place.
There are undoubtedly colossal problems in Detroit, and the bosses of the Big Three automakers could never be convicted of an excess of imagination.
To attribute the Swiss vote to ban minarets – an idea that was promoted by the right-wing Swiss People’s Party, but by none of the other political parties – to “Islamophobia” is perhaps to miss the point.
Foreign travel was for soldiers, diplomats, and rich people.
Populist demagogues blame political, cultural, and commercial elites for the anxieties of the modern world. They are accused, not entirely without reason, of imposing mass immigration, economic crisis, and loss of national identity on ordinary citizens.
The Pope has an answer, of course.
They weaken it by undermining our elected representatives, whose job is to exercise their good judgment rather than voice the gut feelings of an anxious, angry people.
But LGIVs obtained a massive amount of financing in 2012 by issuing bonds and trust loans.
The risk stemming from local-government debt is exacerbated further by massive amounts of non-explicit debt acquired through arrears, credits, and guarantees.
Indeed, it is increasingly common for banks’ off-balance-sheet lending to exceed newly issued balance-sheet credit.
China also needs a new financing model for infrastructure projects.
It wasn’t after a long illness, or even after a car crash.
Until I had these conversations, I didn’t really believe that Kris had died.
But that wasn’t Kris, fleeing some kind of sad life.
We communicated by e-mail, but mostly face-to-face a few times a year, ever since we met.
Indeed, Kris will live on much more effectively – and more accessibly to all her friends.
This means that for the first three years of a presidency brought to power amidst great popular demands, López Obrador would be able to enact little reform legislation.
If more evidence emerges, democratic prudence councils a complete recount.
Before a no confidence vote can be held, agreement must be reached on a new government majority to take its place.
In these circumstances, the model functions as classic presidentialism (even if it does not produce legislative majorities).
Accumulating excessive debt usually entails moving some part of domestic aggregate demand forward in time, so the exit from that debt must include more savings and diminished demand.
Consider southern Europe.
Several possibilities – not mutually exclusive – come to mind.
Then there is the time dimension.
Experience can be a harsh, though necessary, teacher.
It is a Spanish-German-French-British-Thai co-production, the kind of international collaborative effort we are increasingly seeing in film – a form of cross-border collaboration that should point the way to other forms of global civil-society projects.
In response, the mayor of Cannes organized a ceremony to commemorate all victims of the French-Algerian conflict.
In most cases, the directors researched their own films by interviewing sources who were close to the action, or close to the main events at a grassroots level.
It may be his last before he hands over power to his apparently designated successor, Vice President Xi Jinping, in 2012 – coincidentally the same year that President Barack Obama will be campaigning for a second term in the White House.
For the rest of us, the key question is whether America and China will be increasingly acrimonious competitors or cooperative partners, albeit with very different political systems.
There must be some explanation for China choosing this moment even for an unnecessary and ham-fisted row with the Vatican.
Iran’s oil and gas should not blind China to the dangers to its neighborhood and the entire world if the Islamic Republic develops a nuclear weapon.
Yet this is the direction in which Chancellor Merkel seems to be heading.
Second, German “exports” go mainly to the EU.
The French government, on the other hand, fears that the Germans’ commitment to eurozone stability is a ploy aimed at pushing France into a corner and leaving it behind economically.
Coordination within the eurozone – above all between its most important economies, France and Germany – is therefore all the more important.
“That is why we are so proud of it.”
Following the March 19 referendum, in which most Islamists campaigned for a package of constitutional amendments and got 77% support, secularists took to the streets, mobilizing behind their own demands.
Their belief in the superiority of literal interpretations of Islamic texts and their deep animosity towards religious innovation (broadly defined) reflect their certainty that the first three generations of Muslims possessed the best understanding of Islam, and should provide guidance for future generations.
Enforcing a secular constitution before elections does not guarantee a secular outcome.
The impact has become impossible to ignore.
Along with regulatory capture, this harmed competitiveness, market openness, and Egypt’s small and medium-size businesses.
This would be not only fair, but it also would teach an important lesson to those who bankroll dictators – a lesson that is likely to have an immediate positive impact worldwide.
Muddling Out of Freefall
Even the Congressional Budget Office is predicting that it will be the middle of the decade before unemployment returns to more normal levels, as America experiences its own version of “Japanese malaise.”
His attempts to please everyone, so evident in the last few weeks, are likely to mollify no one.
And, without that, more likely than not, the economy will face another crisis in the not-too-distant future.
Unfortunately, the problem runs a lot deeper than a few bad drugs sold at the corner pharmacy. Around $75 billion of substandard drugs are sold annually, causing an estimated 100,000 deaths worldwide, and making many more people seriously ill.
It is therefore imperative to develop new detection technologies that will work in poorer countries, and that complement existing systems such as bar codes.
November’s Diplomatic Harvest
The new European Commission took office on November 1, launching its mandate with a plan to boost public and private investment by €315 billion ($392 billion) over the next three years. Similarly, in Brisbane, the G-20 approved a package of economic measures to boost global economic growth by 2.1 percentage points by 2018.
The Obama administration has estimated that, once applied, this agreement – which was frozen for a year as China sought to protect its domestic industry – will increase annual global GDP by $190 billion.
In Jerusalem, mounting tension over holy sites has highlighted the difficulty of moving the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward.
Some important economies are still fighting deflation.
Fiscal policy should be focused on promoting growth and creating jobs, while maintaining medium-term credibility.
Most important, the culture of the financial sector needs to change.
We will need to update, adapt, and deepen our methods of working together.
Against this backdrop, the adoption of the IMF reforms by the United States Congress would send a long-overdue signal to rapidly growing emerging economies that the world counts on their voices, and their resources, to find global solutions to global problems.
This program, like so many educational or cultural Israeli-Palestinian partnerships, began in starry-eyed idealism.
But then reality intervened again.
One quote from a Palestinian TV production team member stayed with me: “This is a shotgun wedding,” he explained when he was advocating for a Palestine-only Sesame Street. “And we want a divorce.”
In the Sesame Street of Palestine and Israel, the failure of the joint venture was really a success: the Muppets and their creators have given us another valuable lesson, this time in how – and how not – to help others.
He blames French society. More specifically, he blames the fact that young Frenchmen of Muslim origin are marginalized on the grounds of their faith and the color of their skin.
They never became sufficiently French. Immigrants must be forced to share “Western values.”
The appeal of Islamist extremism may have been its glorification of violence more than any religious content.
Still, most enthusiasts of this type of entertainment do not actually go out and kill people.
Suppressing violent pornography will not get rid of rapists or high-school killers.
Since the two countries’ separation is now more than six decades old, that anomaly is unlikely to be repeated.
It was a low point in Indo-Pakistan relations, and no one in Delhi was prepared to trust Musharraf ever again.
If Musharraf had previously been unwilling to choose sides, the attempts to kill him finally showed him which side he had to be on.
Musharraf’s fraying authority made him less effective and, indeed, less useful: the Taliban re-emerged in strength on Pakistan’s Afghan border, and his own ISI was proved to have been involved in the bombing of India’s embassy in Kabul.
General Musharraf appeared on the national scene on October 12, 1999, when he ousted an elected government and announced an ambitious “nation-building” project.
A series of ill-planned military operations in the tribal areas further complicated the situation in the volatile border region.
While he announced that he would leave his military position “if” he was elected president, his track record of reneging on his promises haunted the judiciary.
Nor can a weak, embattled, and disoriented Musharraf be expected to fight Islamic militancy effectively or bring political stability to Pakistan.

Indeed, the infinite renewal of the body isn’t confined to superficial repairs through cosmetic surgery.
Most people are shocked when they learn that one-fifth of the human genome has been patented, mostly by private firms.
The stem cell debates often seem to be premised on the assumption that only the status of the embryo matters.
(Pioneers for Communism, like Che we shall be!)," we repeated day after day before starting class.
We felt once again the integrity of what it's like to share the burden of a common predicament.

DAVOS – The future of the global economy will depend greatly on whether President Barack Obama launches a comprehensive and coherent set of measures, and on how successfully he carries them out.
The effort to pump the American economy full of money will run into difficulties on two fronts: the exchange rate and interest rates.
The euro headed lower right from the beginning of 2009 and it was even outpaced by sterling.
The owners of wealth may increasingly turn to the yen and gold for safety but the may run into resistance from the authorities—sooner in the case of the yen than gold.
It is difficult, but not impossible, to imagine the U.S. economy growing at a rate of 3 percent or more in the decade ahead.
China
That will not be easy for either side.
Remittances from the Gulf States will suffer and its outsourcing business will languish, but hopefully infrastructure investments, of which India has a great backlog, will continue apace.
A New NATO plan ought to call for an orderly exit, but that is not possible while al Qaeda and the Taliban are gathering strength.
Some of the major oil-surplus countries, notably Iran, Venezuela, and Russia, have been enemies of the current world order, and their wings are being trimmed.
The first group was decimated by the financial crisis; the second was left relatively unscathed.
The key to Europe’s ability to neutralize Russia’s geopolitical advantage is to establish a unified energy policy, with a Europe-wide distribution network and a Europe-wide regulatory authority that has precedence over national regulators.
Therefore the odds favor that the euro will emerge from the current crisis with the ECB given greater powers over the banking system.
Mexico has a serious security problem because of drug trafficking.
A groundswell of new international initiatives will soon emerge to move this agenda forward.
In addition, Australia and Japan have launched a major international commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  My own multimedia “WMD—WeMustDisarm!” campaign, which will culminate on the International Day of Peace (21 September), will reinforce growing calls for disarmament by former statesmen and grassroots campaigns, such as “Global Zero.”
My fourth point addresses accountability and transparency.  Countries with nuclear weapons should publish more information about what they are doing to fulfill their disarmament commitments.  While most of these countries have revealed some details about their weapons programs, we still do not know how many nuclear weapons exist worldwide.  The UN Secretariat could serve as a repository for such data.
Best of luck to you as you leave the academy for your chosen professions in finance.
Young finance professionals need to familiarize themselves with the history of banking, and recognize that it is at its best when it serves ever-broadening spheres of society.
Those of you deciding to pursue careers as economists and finance scholars need to develop a better understanding of asset bubbles – and better ways to communicate this understanding to the finance profession and to the public.
The world needs you to succeed.

Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it, and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.”
Japan is deploying vast government aid and private-sector engagement reminiscent of its investments in China at the height of Japanese global economic power in the 1980’s.
John Pang, the Chief Executive of CARI, a research organization based in Malaysia, says that today’s transitional Myanmar/Burma is “a game the Chinese gave away.”
This is the lesson of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which celebrates its 20th birthday this year.
Canada also benefited.
“We’re not just selling things to each other,” explains Serra Puche. “Now, we’re producing things jointly.”
John F. Kennedy launched what became the Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and Bill Clinton helped secure congressional passage of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which had been initiated and negotiated under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.
Indeed, if there was ever a moment for Congressional approval of the IMF reform package, this was it: the measure would have greatly increased the IMF’s ability to support Ukraine, a key American objective, at a much lower cost than the alternative of a US bilateral credit guarantee.
Whereas wealthy countries hold the most World Bank shares, borrowing countries hold a slight majority of the shares (and the presidency) at the regional banks.
In short, an internationally diminished US is loath to relinquish its dominance of global institutions, yet unwilling to shoulder the associated financial and political costs.
Over time, these arrangements will erode the US dollar’s role as the world’s leading reserve currency.
On economic, financial, tax, trade, and climate issues, many people around the world are fearful or angry, believing&nbsp; that a worldwide cabal of bankers, corporations, and G-20 elites uses insider deals to monopolize the benefits of globalization.
True, global “government” can go too far – for example, when WTO rules conflict with sensible local environmental safeguards, or when IMF requirements for developing-country borrowers narrow the scope for creative heterodoxy in growth and poverty-reducing policies. It is also true that countries dependent on official aid and IMF loans can face unwarranted pressure to conform to outsiders’ wrongheaded policy views – from premature opening of capital markets in Asia in the 1990’s to force-fed austerity in Greece and Spain today.
Moreover, fair global rules can help to “democratize” the global market, especially if they are embedded in institutions with a degree of autonomy for highly professional staff who can act with some independence from short-term political pressures. It should come as no surprise that the anti-globalists’ erstwhile punching bags – the World Bank and, increasingly, the IMF and the WTO – are more open and transparent than many of their member states.
Superficially, it may seem as if we have reached that breakthrough moment at which gender is no longer the most important issue.
Most intriguingly of all, Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, is now in a neck-and-neck race with another woman, Marina Silva.
Similarly, African-American leaders sometimes joke wryly about gaining the reins of municipal power just when a city is about to go bankrupt.
Appalling wages are just the start.
Today, it relies mainly on low-wage farmworkers from Haiti, Mexico, Guatemala, and other Central American countries – a change that owes much to two decades of trade liberalization.
That changed when activists began targeting the multinational corporations at the top of the pyramid, rather than the growers (who are now merely middlemen squeezed by global companies).
By leveraging their massive purchasing power, big multinational food corporations drive down prices, not only impoverishing farmworkers, but also eroding the profits of the growers who employ them.
The founders have deep roots in news media, social media, and technology: Katharine Zaleski is former Executive Director of the digital Washington Post and the first news editor of the Huffington Post; Milena Berry is former Chief Technology Officer of Avaaz.org, the global donations platform.
“She said, ‘I am starting this company.
Their goal is to change the nature of work across the board for women.
“Thirty percent of women in many countries in the Middle East have university degrees,” Zaleski explains, but they often cannot get jobs commensurate with their training for cultural reasons.
That is good news for anyone, male or female, who has young children or aging parents – or simply wants a more balanced life.
Had Al Gore maintained her husband’s high margin among women in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996, the Supreme Court would not have decided his 2000 election fight with George W. Bush.
The term “glass ceiling” is itself elitist, deriving as it does from the corporate struggles of a few professional women.
At a time of ever-increasing income disparity in America, is it not a serious political flaw in any presidential candidate not to know how to speak sensitively about wealth and poverty? And, given diminishing government transparency in the US and more and more secret law, is it not a serious issue that a presidential candidate will not address his or her mistakes and shortcomings?

कर के मोर्चे पर, एक प्रमुख घोषणा की गई है: अगले चार वर्षों में कॉर्पोरेट टैक्स की दर 30% से कम करके 25% की जाएगी, जिससे निजी क्षेत्र के निवेश को प्रोत्साहन मिला है। वस्तु और सेवा कर - जो एक तरह का मूल्य वर्धित कर है जिसके बारे में सरकार ने सराहनीय प्रगति की है - का कार्यान्वयन एक बड़ी उपलब्धि होगी और इससे अर्थव्यवस्था को बहुत अधिक प्रोत्साहन मिलेगा। तथापि, व्यय में भारी वृद्धि किए जाने के बावजूद, बजट देश के राजकोषीय घाटे को उचित सीमा के भीतर रखने के लिए मुख्य रूप से विकास और अधिक कर संग्रह पर निर्भर करता है।
PARIS – Before the second round of France’s regional elections on Sunday, most predictions suggested that five, perhaps six, of the country’s regional governments would fall into the hands of the National Front (FN).
But what caused the nation to right itself?
On the contrary, a sufficient number of voters came to understand that in that very anger – in its spokespeople and in the words used to express it – lurked a threat to the republic, to democracy, and to the nation’s fundamental values.
There have been other times in France’s history when entire segments of the electorate have ejected themselves from the game, without the rest of the players rushing over to beg them to get back on the field.
And, because those who believed this (virtually everyone whose voices were heard) belatedly perceived its insulting connotation, discussing the matter has caused considerable anguish in the years since.
And, precisely because nationalism shapes the way we think, its role in phenomena that do not trumpet their nationalist motivation – like Al Qaeda’s attacks in 2001 – can easily be overlooked.
In an advanced modern society, such as Germany, intellectuals have no difficulty using openly nationalist language to convince a nationally conscious populace of threats to national prestige.
For the time being, the Chinese may be too preoccupied with their own backyard to pay attention to such insults, but it is foolish to offend them deliberately.
In this bi-polar system, the parties differed on the nuances of economic policy, but broadly agreed on democratic values, the European project, and the need to adapt to and manage globalization, rather than reject it wholesale.
Meanwhile, many people in Europe face greater economic insecurity, owing to new technologies or competition from lower-cost workers elsewhere.
Meanwhile, the rise of identity-driven political movements presents a huge challenge for Europe’s traditional political parties.
NATO After Istanbul
At the request of Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, NATO decided to offer to help train Iraqi security forces.
The allies decided to accelerate their efforts to equip NATO with the forces and technologies it needs to perform twenty-first century missions, from the Balkans to Afghanistan.
We also launched the "Istanbul Cooperation Initiative," to offer practical security-related cooperation to countries in the broader Middle East.
But that Cold War world is long gone.
This became particularly important after the Al Qaeda attacks on September 11, 2001, shifted the focus of American foreign policy toward transnational terrorism.
Hamid Karzai’s government remains weak, and the economy continues to be heavily dependent upon opium production. The Taliban and Al Qaeda networks are re-emerging as political and military threats.
NATO Must Be Saved
That is also why the modest efforts now being undertaken by the alliance to assist America in trying to stabilize Iraq will not stitch NATO back together again.
True, their security from military attack is currently no longer at stake. But NATO is more than just a defense pact.
That dangerous indifference is the most serious sign of NATO's crisis.
The transition plan cements that strategic shift.
Although Pakistan is now the largest recipient of US aid in the world, the Failed States Index2010, created by Foreign Policy and the Fund for Peace, ranks the country 10th, between Guinea and Haiti.
A withdrawal of US and other NATO troops will not mean the end of the war, because the enemy will continue to target Western interests, wherever they may be.
Greece vehemently opposed its tiny northern neighbor – with only two million inhabitants – using the name Macedonia and symbols from the days of Alexander the Great in its flag and crest.
In other words, Russia is being allowed to re-assert its “sphere of influence” – a concept that should have been superceded by that of “Europe Whole and Free,” which the entire European Union appeared to have embraced when communism collapsed.
The crux of the matter is Europe’s lack of political will to forge a unified stand toward Russia.
After all, the recent military escalation in the region is at least partly due to that strategy.
It will not hide the fact that Israel has run out of unilateral options.
But that can no longer be an argument against diplomacy now that Israeli unilateralism has once again proven to be a strategic blind alley.
Finally, we also know that the leaders of this fanatical tide are few, but now have the sympathy of millions of ordinary Muslims.
There is also no shortage of images of abused prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison or the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, which have likewise done more to recruit new adherents to Islamic fanaticism than any sermon in a radical mosque.
Police actions must be merciless, even if this means more controls and surveillance.
The agenda appears straightforward, but “Paris III” has acquired a barely concealed political purpose: to bolster the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora in the face of a powerful domestic challenge led by Hezbollah, and by extension to curb the influence of Hezbollah’s regional backers, Syria and Iran.
The West should also recognize that the constituencies of Hezbollah and its allied, largely Christian, Free Patriotic Movement, led by presidential contender Michel Aoun, will be hit hardest by many of Siniora’s proposed economic and administrative reforms, such as lifting fuel subsidies and sharply raising value added tax.
Need Versus Greed
China’s economy is growing at around 10% annually.
Our planet will not physically support this exponential economic growth if we let greed take the upper hand.
The great aquifers that supply water for irrigation are being depleted.
The rise in food prices is leading to a land grab, as powerful politicians sell foreign investors massive tracts of farmland, brushing aside the traditional land rights of poor smallholders.
NEW YORK – Baruch Spinoza, the seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher, Benjamin Disraeli, the nineteenth-century British prime minister, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the twenty-first century French president, have one thing in common: all were sons of immigrants.
We who live in rapidly aging societies, such as Western Europe or Japan, still need immigrants.
Islamist extremism is a handy revolutionary creed for vulnerable young people to latch onto, to gain a sense of power and belonging.
Children of guest workers feel unwanted.
This means working out what jobs need to be filled, and welcoming those who will fill them, not as guests, but as equal citizens.
In other words, negative nominal rates merely make your return more negative than it already was.
If you were holding Swiss franc assets at a negative nominal return right before its central bank abandoned its euro peg in mid-January, you could have made a 20% return overnight; a negative nominal return is a small price to pay for a large capital gain.
Indeed, if the advanced economies were to suffer from secular stagnation, a world with negative interest rates on both short- and long-term bonds could become the new normal.


They are part of a people of whom another 1.3 million live in Israel, and another two million in the West Bank.
In the end, Sharon and then Binyamin Netanyahu both ended up sitting down at the negotiating table with Yassir Arafat and his representatives to try to reach an agreement.
But at least we will know that we are not fighting for an impossible objective that can only result in blood and devastation – blood and devastation that will weigh on the collective memories of the sons and grandsons of our neighbors, who will remain our enemies, even if the spinning top continues to turn.
In 2009, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer campaigning against corruption, died in prison after being denied medical care for life-threatening conditions.
His popularity now stands at 86%.
In 1934, Joseph Stalin, too, ordered a thorough investigation into the murder of a rival: Sergei Kirov, the head of the Communist Party in Leningrad.
Will Putin, like Stalin, unleash his own great terror, and murderously pursue supposed adversaries? Or will Nemtsov's death finally move complacent and obedient Russians to action?
Centuries of inculcation with Confucianism was as important to the rise of East Asia’s hyper-growth economies as the conjunction of Protestantism and the rise of capitalism was to the west.
Neo-Confucianism provided the basic ideology for China’s admiring neighbors – Japan, Korea, and Vietnam – until the advent of the West.
Periodic civil strife and rebellion were not eliminated, but only in Vietnam was the longevity of a dynasty a cloak for inextinguishable internecine warfare.
The emperor was the supreme paterfamilias, his benevolent rule reciprocated by the obedience of his ministers and subjects, while family members were fixed in their appropriate hierarchical relationships.
Better for the West to accept equality now – and struggle to maintain it.
The deadlock spilled over into the country's politics, with shifting coalitions forming four successive governments that collapsed within months, each time in a welter of recrimination from the parties that had been excluded.
The opposition Maoist-Madhesi alliance wants the decision rule to be consensus, whereas the exasperated government proposes requiring a two-thirds majority.
The monarchists are hoping for a return to absolutism. Centralists view federalism as a fig leaf for secession.
But Nepal's political landscape is showing no sign of a thaw.
More than 16,000 schools have been damaged, including some 5,000 that were completely destroyed.
Indeed, only a fraction of humanitarian aid budgets, roughly 1%, is allocated to education.
Schools provide more than the skills that children will need in later life; they also serve as vehicles for disseminating lifesaving health and safety information.
Its bloody ten-year civil war, however, was seldom in the international limelight.
For these groups, the restoration of democracy was a step toward social transformation, enabling them to participate more equally in the life of the country.
But the biggest challenges go to the roots of the insurgency: poverty, injustice, and discrimination.
Kewajiban Net-Zero
Semakin cepat kita mematikan keran, semakin rendah suhu yang menstabilkan iklim, semakin kecil risiko yang harus dihadapi, dan semakin sedikit biaya yang harus dikeluarkan untuk adaptasi pemanasan bumi.
Akan tetapi beberapa teknologi “pembuangan CO2” masih pada tahap pengembangan yang masih dini.
Pada bulan Mei 2015, Kamar Dagang Internasional (International Chamber of Commerce) dan para Direktur Utama/CEO dari seluruh dunia menyerukan emisi nihil.
"शुद्ध-शून्य उत्सर्जन" एक ऐसा नवीनतम "समाधान" उभरकर सामने आया है जो तथाकथित "कार्बन अभिग्रहण और भंडारण" पर निर्भर करता है। हालाँकि प्रौद्योगिकी को अभी भी थोड़ी-बहुत कमियों का सामना करना पड़ रहा है, जलवायु परिवर्तन के अंतर-सरकारी पैनल (IPCC) के अध्यक्ष राजेन्द्र पचौरी ने पिछले महीने एक अत्यंत समस्यात्मक वक्तव्य जारी किया, जिसमें उन्होंने कहा कि “कार्बन अभिग्रहण और भंडारण (CCS) के साथ यह पूरी तरह संभव है कि जीवाश्म ईंधनों का उपयोग बड़े पैमाने पर किया जाना जारी रहे।”
किसी भी स्थिति में, कार्बन अभिग्रहण और भंडारण (CCS) का कोई भी रूप पूर्ण अकार्बनिकरण की ओर संरचनात्मक बदलाव के लक्ष्य को आगे नहीं बढ़ाता है, जिसके लिए सामाजिक आंदोलनों, शिक्षाविदों, आम नागरिकों, और यहाँ तक कि कुछ नेताओं द्वारा अधिकाधिक माँग की जा रही है। वे संक्रमण के दौरान होनेवाली असुविधाओं और त्यागों को स्वीकार करने के लिए तैयार हैं; वास्तव में, वे शून्य-कार्बन अर्थव्यवस्था तैयार करने की चुनौती को नवीनीकरण और अपने समाजों और समुदायों में सुधार लाने के एक अवसर के रूप में देखते हैं। इस तरह के किसी प्रयास में खतरनाक, गुमराह करनेवाली, और दिवा-स्वप्नों वाली प्रौद्योगिकियों का कोई स्थान नहीं है।
Had he not fueled global hysteria over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the crippling international sanctions regime that eventually pushed Iran to a deal might never have been implemented.
Despite the obvious problems with Netanyahu’s position, dismissing it would be a mistake.
In this Hobbesian worldview, the threats can stem from virtually any development – political, strategic, or otherwise – and amount to existential challenges to the entire Jewish nation.
Israel’s Labour Party, which is now debating whether to join Netanyahu’s government, should consider carefully whether it can bring about such a shift.
Two former Mossad directors joined a chorus of Israelis in arguing that he should no longer be prime minister.
Such beliefs, of course, have been around for much longer than the modern state of Israel.
There is some truth to this view.
And a tougher US stance toward its ally might force the Israelis to try harder to come to terms with the Palestinians.
The Zionist Union, the principal opponent of Netanyahu’s Likud party, focused mostly on domestic issues like housing, the high cost of living, and growing economic inequality.
That is a tragedy, because it drives both sides into a cycle of action and reaction that ultimately will make impossible a negotiated two-state solution – the kind of solution in which each side gives up something it wants in order to gain something that both sides want more.
If the Palestinians fail, they will most likely turn again to violence: a third intifada, bigger and with greater international support than the first two.
And then run?
In an era of ballistic missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, and in which the planned Palestinian state is supposed to be demilitarized, why is it so vital for Israel to see its army “sit along the Jordan River”? If such a tripwire is really necessary, why shouldn’t a reliable international force carry out that task?
The son of a renowned historian who served as the personal secretary of Zeev Jabotinski, the founder of the Zionist right, Netanyahu absorbed from childhood his father’s interpretation of Jewish history as a series of tragedies.
Let us not avert our eyes lest our arms weaken….This is the fate of our generation, this is our life choice, to be prepared and armed, strong and determined, lest the sword be stricken from our fist and our lives cut down….We are a generation of settlers, and, without the steel helmet and the cannon’s fire, we will not be able to plant a tree and build a home.”
Of course, a great leader must always have a sense of history.
During Obama’s first meeting with a Middle East leader, a simple and courageous Arab plan was outlined.
The US has also opposed Israel’s unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem, and – along with every country on the planet – refused to recognize the application of Israeli law to residents of East Jerusalem.
A third imperative for Palestinians is to reunite the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Otherwise, tension looms in the Israeli-American relationship, and calls for one state with equal rights for all will begin to drown out older ideological visions, as settlement activity forecloses the prospect of two states.
At sumud’s core lies the unswerving, blinkered view that Israel is illegitimate and its duration limited.
Indeed, while settlement-building in the West Bank has slackened, it continues.
Furthermore, Netanyahu’s unsentimental assessment of the Middle East does not line up with that of the Obama administration – in thrall to its collapsing romance with moderate Islamists – and its devoted supporters among Jewish Americans.
Netanyahu’s Useless Demand
I believe that some of the preconditions posed by the Israeli prime minister in his recent, widely reported speech are fully justified.
But the other condition demanded by Netanyahu, that the Palestinians recognize the right of the Jewish people to their own state, or the existence of the Jewish nation, is completely arbitrary.
With the advent of peace, we all hope that this bond will become consolidated around a common Israeli citizenship.
Some create strong ties, while others produce weak ties. Think of the difference between friendships and acquaintances.
As leaders increasingly need to understand the relationship of networks to power, they will have to adapt strategies and create teams that benefit from both strong and weak ties.
In some cases, one can orchestrate a complex network simply with carefully specified contracts.
Former President George W. Bush called himself “the decider,” but leadership today is more collaborative and integrative than that implies.
That might sound like a bad thing: Karadžić, who once warned Bosnia’s Muslims that war would lead them down the road to hell, surely deserves to be sentenced for the acts of which he was just acquitted – murder, siege, and slaughter almost beyond naming.
Genocide requires “special intent.”
Genocide makes other crimes seem less important.
It is not more&nbsp;wrong to kill people because of their ethnicity than it is to kill them because of their political beliefs, gender, or for the sheer pleasure of watching them die.
This is the real reason to drop “the crime of crimes”: its redundancy.
New Alliances for a New Century
It is important to note that since 2001, the US has probably done more things, with more nations, in more constructive ways, and in more parts of the world, than at any other time in its history.
The same holds true for China.
New and True Europeans
Cynics may argue that the new member countries could afford to make such concessions because they would end up with hefty EU subsidies anyway.
In contrast, West European states do no longer seem so concerned with the political dimension of European integration.
Although the collapse of the common currency area owing to political squabbles seems unlikely at this point, it cannot be ruled out entirely.
The problem is that both groups of borrowers have been transferring large sums of money to other countries.
Fiscal responsibility in the eurozone would be fatally undermined.
Greece would remain within the eurozone, having lost some of its fiscal and structural sovereignty.
Its member states would accept that monetary union is impossible without fiscal and structural coordination.
Conflicts rage in too many places.
For example, four years ago, when I came to office, only a handful of global leaders knew enough even to talk about climate change – the defining challenge of our times, whose effects we see every day, all around us.
The conventional wisdom will tell you that the MDGs targets – reducing poverty and hunger, improving the health of mothers and children, combating HIV/AIDS, increasing access to education, protecting the environment, and forging a global partnership for development – are simply unattainable.
“Present at the Creation,” he called his memoir.
Amid such uncertainty, our future depends on a UN that brings together the countries of the world not only to talk and debate, but also to agree and to act; that mobilizes civil society, business, philanthropists, and ordinary citizens to help the world’s governments solve current problems; and that delivers peace, development, human rights, and global public goods – in a word, hope – to people around the world every day.
From the point of view of developing countries in need of capital, competing banks probably look like a good thing.
This new model moves beyond the mantra of “public-private partnership.”
The federal government no longer has billions of dollars to dole out to foreign governments, while China is far more centralized and less beholden to its taxpayers.
New Green Drivers of Growth
The very resources that we need to protect will have been substantially depleted by then. Done properly, protecting rain forests is a cost-effective method both to abate climate change and to provide sustainable livelihoods for many millions of people now living in rural poverty.
Equally, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Developemnt has placed energy efficiency center-stage in much of its work on market-led sectoral transformation programs across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The initiatives described here, as well as others discussed in the AGF’s report, offer a major opportunity to reorient the global economy towards resource-saving, low-carbon growth by using limited public resources to stimulate large-scale private investment.
The European Union managed to preserve the essence of its acquis diplomatique.
They also struggled to pursue a united approach to Azerbaijan and Ukraine, and continued to seek a coherent approach to Turkey as accession negotiations remained blocked.
This is a daunting task, given the EU’s current structure.
The world has taken an important step toward controlling climate change by agreeing to the Bali Action Plan at the global negotiations in Indonesia earlier this month.
Second, we must accomplish this while leaving room for continued rapid economic development and poverty reduction.
Such emissions can be eliminated by either shifting to renewable forms of energy or reducing the emissions from fossil fuels.
We must ensure that all countries adopt a verifiable strategy for environmentally sound technology, and that rich countries fulfill the Bali Action Plan’s promise to provide “financial and other incentives” to enable poor countries to adopt the new technologies.
The notion seems like science fiction: everyone knows that AI is not particularly clever.
HIV alone attracts many billions per year.
Neurons operate as a cooperative group: more arrive at the location than are needed for a simple replacement.
As it happens, there is a naturally occurring information structure in which the needed behaviors are easier to observe and explain. That structure can be found in stories.
NEW DELHI – Political transitions in East Asia promise to mark a defining moment in the region’s jittery geopolitics.
But, even if Moon becomes president, the new strains in South Korea’s relationship with Japan, owing to the revival of historical issues, may not be easy to mend.
China’s behavior has fueled a nationalist backlash in Japan, helping to turn hawkish, marginal politicians like Shintaro Ishihara into important mainstream figures.
His wife, Peng Liyuan, is also linked to the military, having served as a civilian member of the army’s musical troupe, and carries an honorary rank of general.
Let me spell out what this means for three policy objectives: building a stronger and safer financial sector, achieving more balanced and more stable growth, and managing large and volatile capital flows.
At the national level, this requires tools to prevent excesses in one sector from bringing down the entire economy.
In the years leading up to the crisis, inequality rose in many countries, with worrisome consequences for social cohesion.
The situation has become quite tense, with talk of “currency wars” and a real risk of financial protectionism.
Let our next failing not be the result of a lack of cooperation.
That is a number roughly the size of six Belgiums, Hungarys, or Swedens.
Impossible? The Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawaris is currently negotiating with the owners of two Greek islands a plan to resettle hundreds of thousands of refugees and put them to work building homes and infrastructure.
Perhaps most important, the majority are linked by family ties to other jihadists.
New Rules for Finance At Last
All are daring and realistic regarding the tasks that await us.
At the Washington Summit last November, the EU suggested a basic principle: all markets, all territories, and all actors putting the global financial system at risk should be monitored.
Indeed, the rating agencies, whose malfunctions contributed to the crisis, must be regulated.
The international financial institutions must support them massively, and also have the resources needed to foresee global unbalances and prevent crises, rather than respond only when events become urgent.
But longer-term secular factors also play a role.
The third option is sterilized intervention.
The argument for this option is that long-term secular factors are important drivers of capital inflows, as advanced-economy investors discover that they are underweight in emerging-market assets and reduce their portfolios’ “home bias.”
They would natu­rally be preoccupied with today’s problems: the eurozone crisis, global recovery, financial regulation, international macroeconomic imbal­ances, and so on.
They need the political buy-in that redistributive taxation, safety nets, and social insurance help generate.
The Basle rules on capital requirements and the World Trade Organization’s rules on subsidies, intellectual property, and investment measures typify this kind of overreaching.
Countries have the right to protect their own regulations and institutions.
Globalization’s rules should not force Americans or Europeans to consume goods that are produced in ways that most citizens in those countries find unacceptable.
7.
The profession’s dissident voices, it seems, are finally reaching a wider audience.
How can firms be understood without examining the corporate contracts that bring together their stakeholders – that is, their shareholders, bankers, suppliers, customers, and employees –&#160;whose complex relationships are manifested in companies’ balance sheets and transaction flows? In concentrating on production and consumption flows, national accounts aggregate or net out such data, thus neglecting the importance of financing and balance-sheet leverage and fragilities.
Meta-economics goes still further, by studying deeper functional aspects of the economy, understood as a complex, interactive, and holistic living system.
Such an approach requires incorporating psychology, anthropology, sociology, history, physics, biology, mathematics, computer science, and other disciplines that study complex adaptive systems.
Policy mistakes ranging from tax hikes to poor central-bank decisions to a global wave of protectionism (most famously America’s Smoot-Hawley tariff) turned a deep recession into the Great Depression.
But China’s trade surplus with the US is not primarily due to undervaluing its currency.  
As recovery continues, this public-sector debt will increasingly crowd out private-sector, local-government and developing-country borrowing.

जिन लोगों में टीबी की शुरूआत हो रही होती है उनके लिए त्वरित नैदानिक परीक्षण सुलभ नहीं होता। कम आय वाले देशों में, निदान की प्रभावी पद्धति बलगम की सूक्ष्मदर्शी यंत्र से जाँच करना है, जो ऐसी पुरानी पड़ चुकी पद्धति है जो सभी संक्रमित रोगियों में से तकरीबन आधे में टीबी का पता लगाने में विफल रहती है, छोटे बच्चों और HIV से संक्रमित रोगियों में तो इसकी सफलता की दर और भी कम है। वास्तव में, बलगम की सूक्ष्मदर्शी यंत्र से जाँच के द्वारा टीबी से ग्रस्त दस में से एक बच्चे से अधिक का निदान नहीं हो पाता।
इसके लिए अनुसंधान की जरूरत है – यह एक ऐसा तथ्य है जिसे डब्ल्यूएचओ की वैश्विक रणनीति स्वीकार करती है। लेकिन टीबी के लिए नैदानिक टूल और उपचारों में निवेश बढ़ाने पर उससे कहीं अधिक खर्च आ रहा है, जितना आबंटित किया गया है। अनुसंधान और विकास के लिए हर वर्ष जरूरी अनुमानित €1.73 बिलियन ($2 बिलियन) में से 2013 में केवल €589 मिलियन का निवेश किया गया।
Investing in the health, education, and skills of children offers the highest economic returns to a country.
Northern European countries generally provide cash support to families to ensure that all children are raised in decent conditions, and they undertake ambitious social programs to provide high-quality day care, pre-school, and primary and secondary education.
There are around 35 births for every 1,000 girls aged 15-19, compared to fewer than ten per thousand in the northern European countries.
In the US, the proportion is much lower, at around 84%.
The UNICEF findings are powerful.
But, by reframing that mission to emphasize support for member governments’ pursuit of inclusive and sustainable growth, the Bank could do even more good.
It has the ability to deploy a variety of financing and risk-sharing instruments in support of both private and public investment.
During the last half-century, America has been a reasonably good steward of international stability – a kind of benign bully operating in the collective interest.
Now a new wave of identity fragmentation, spanning Africa and perhaps Europe, may be approaching.
In Côte d’Ivoire, for example, former President Laurent Gbagbo takes inspiration from Zimbabwe’s autocratic President Robert Mugabe, clinging to power after his clear defeat in the last presidential elections.
But, as the economic crisis persists – and perhaps even worsens – we may witness further explosions of populism and nationalism that could translate into a new wave of fragmentation.
Imperial traditions never fade away completely.
But these earlier reforms were in fact more difficult to undertake than the ones that I launched in the 1980's and 1990's.
Indeed, from my first appearance as General Secretary of the USSR, at the funeral of my predecessor, Constantine Chernyenko, I said that every country should be responsible for its own politics.
As a result, the subsequent spurt of globalization has proceeded with no one steering the wheel - and thus with no means to implement new thinking for a better world.
So, fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world remains more in need of new thinking than ever.
I have proposed a plan that would allow Italy and Spain to refinance their debt by issuing treasury bills at around 1%. I named it in memory of my friend Tomasso Padoa-Schioppa, who, as Italy’s central banker in the 1990’s, helped to stabilize that country’s finances.
This would greatly improve the sustainability of these countries’ debt.
Together, the ECB and the EFSF could do what the ECB cannot do on its own.
New Year’s Hope against Hope
On both sides of the Atlantic, unemployment remained stubbornly high, at around 10%.
Europe and America have the same talented people, the same resources, and the same capital that they had before the recession.
But the country also suffered in the years before the crisis – years of IMF bailouts and austerity –from high unemployment and poverty rates and low and negative growth.
                                    Heroes come, heroes go.
The red of the Revolution, of course, and the black of the oppressed race.
Life in and with this city was as hypnotic as a drug.
In the World Trade Center, human creativity and collaboration were universally codified.
A famous map painted by my friend and compatriot Saul Steinberg depicts the global village as seen from Manhattan: the distance from the Hudson River to the Pacific Ocean is the same as the distance from Ninth to Tenth Avenue on the Upper West Side, and somewhere beyond the calm ocean float Russia, China, and Japan.
In the Bronx or in Soho, in Washington Square or Times Square, in front of the New York Public Library or near a hot dog stand, across all the planets’ races, the banal vies with the exceptional for one’s attention.
Its workforce labors round the clock and its inventiveness, energy, and diversity counter provincialism with scorn. Like America itself, although so utterly different, New York can only be comprehended “synthetically.”
Civilizing the Marketplace of Ideas
A “social science” like economics is supposed to be free of partisan vitriol.
As historians are trained to do, I based my argument on the archives.
Words like “cockroach,” “delusional,” “derp,” “dope,” “fool,” “knave,” “mendacious idiot,” and “zombie” have no place in civilized debate.
But his arguments in this area failed his own “test of truth,” for they lacked “the power…to get…accepted in the competition of the market.”
Appropriately defined triggers thus address one of the main criticisms of international aid.
The Netherlands led the way, slashing its aid to basic education by 36%, outpacing even the 31% cut by crisis-ridden Spain.
What kinds of triggers should be specified for mobilizing buy-down funds? How would it be decided whether these targets had been met?
For many observers, populism is unthinkable without a strong, direct bond between an anti-establishment leader and citizens who feel neglected by mainstream political parties.
Typically, in the populist political imagination, elites disproportionately care for &#160;those who, like themselves, do not really belong. Europe’s elites are regularly accused of lavishing benefits on ethnic minorities in the name of protecting their rights.
Where direct democracy is very much a part of normal politics – in Switzerland, for example – populist parties have been doing better, not worse, than elsewhere.
Nicolas Sarkozy’s French Lessons
Second, and equally important, the extremist vote is weakening.
But this is understandable.
The fifth lesson may be the most serious.
This lesson is so evident that the French Socialist Party now faces a clear choice.
These benefits come in the form of new and better goods and services, as well as efficiency savings for businesses, consumers, and citizens.
Many also permit customers to compare quality ratings, safety data (drawn, for example, from official injury reports), information about the provenance of food, and producers’ environmental and labor practices.
There are also opportunities to prevent lifestyle-related diseases and improve treatment by enabling patients to compare their own data with aggregated data on similar patients.
Consumers, policymakers, and companies must work together, not just to agree on common standards of analysis, but also to set the ground rules for the protection of privacy and property.
But an often-unacknowledged feature of Nigerian politics is that citizens usually back underdogs.
Biafra’s attempted secession in 1967, and the subsequent civil war in which millions died, was triggered by rigged elections, massive official corruption, and the cynical use of ethnicity to achieve political ends.
Indeed, The Economist drew attention recently to the region’s volatility, with militancy on the rise among the young and attacks on civilians and security forces increasingly common.
Analysts had predicted that the election would be marred by violence like that following the presidential poll in 2011, which Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator and candidate of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), lost to the PDP’s Goodluck Jonathan. The mainly Muslim northern part of the country – Buhari’s home base – was convulsed by anarchy and bloodshed as thugs and hooligans took to the streets, attacking Christians and non-northerners, whom they accused of voting for Jonathan.
Recognizing the north’s desperation to win back the presidency, the APC nominated Buhari.
During the campaign, Buhari and other APC leaders put little flesh on their proposed solutions to Nigeria’s many problems. It was enough to remind Nigerians of what had not worked.
Instead, the authorities acted swiftly, isolating patients and monitoring their contacts for 21 days. They screened travelers entering the country and conducted a major public-information campaign to educate citizens on how to contain the epidemic.
Some 50% of the funds would be spent on an expanded, revitalized National Health Insurance Scheme.
Nigeria took on a potentially devastating opponent – the Ebola virus – and won.
यह नाइजीरिया और इस रोग के उन्मूलन के प्रयास में लगे उसके सभी सहयोगियों के लिए एक महान उपलब्धि है। 30 साल से कम समय पहले तक, 125 देश पोलियो से ग्रस्त थे, जिससे हर दिन 1,000 बच्चे लकवाग्रस्त हो जाते थे। अब तक, केवल तीन देश ही ऐसे थे जहाँ वायरस को अभी भी स्थानिक माना जाता है: अफ़गानिस्तान, पाकिस्तान और नाइजीरिया। स्वास्थ्य अधिकारी किसी देश को पोलियो-मुक्त घोषित करने से पहले तीन साल इंतजार करते हैं, लेकिन नाइजीरिया में एक साल की उपलब्धि से इस बात की उम्मीद बलवती हो गई है कि शायद हमने पहले ही इस देश में - और पूरे अफ्रीका में - वाइल्ड पोलियो का अंतिम मामला देख लिया है।

Indeed, the presidential election degenerated into a crude exercise in ballot rigging and voter intimidation.
Moreover, Obasanjo has a long and sorry track record when it comes to elections.
If they unite in their moment of adversity and take their grievance into the streets, they will have to confront the generals, notorious for their disregard of civil rights and liberties.
Nigeria’s Resurgent Oil Diplomacy
But old habits die hard.
In the early 1990’s, desperately short of hard currency, Nigeria negotiated contracts permitting the oil companies to develop new fields and recoup their investment before sharing profits.
Nigeria’s Road to Ruin
At stake is the cohesion of a state that many argue is yet another example of an artificial nation cobbled together by Europeans who did not understand their creation’s social, tribal, and religious forces.
Dokubu then forced Obasanjo into a peace deal.
In addition, religious violence sparked by the Danish cartoons mocking the prophet Muhammad ripped through Nigeria in February.
On the contrary, the risks of extended political instability and further large-scale disruptions to Nigeria’s oil output will remain high, at a time when the world can least afford it.
In April 2007, Yar’Adua won a disputed landslide presidential victory.
Corruption investigations launched by Yar’Adua’s government have uncovered broader and deeper problems than many knew existed.
But there are plenty of unanswered questions about his kidney condition and rumors that he may even have Churg-Strauss Syndrome, a life-threatening autoimmune disease.
NEW YORK – On January 10, a particularly atrocious terrorist attack was mounted in a bustling market in the northern Nigerian town of Maiduguri: a ten-year-old girl detonated an explosive device hidden beneath her dress, killing at least 16 people and injuring dozens of others.
Like the LRA, Boko Haram represents a serious threat to regional stability.
This failure to act – not only to prevent further attacks, but also to ensure accountability for past atrocities – is both wrong and dangerous.
Nigeria’s government and the international community must learn the lessons of the LRA and act immediately to save lives and bring perpetrators to justice.
Educational establishments should be designated as safe havens, deserving protection in exactly the same way that the Geneva Conventions protect Red Cross hospitals.
In Pakistan, 132 students were killed in an attack on a school in December.
Some may have already been married off. Some may have been sold.
ABUJA – Nigeria’s legislative elections, to be followed by a presidential poll on April 16, indicate that the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has lost its near-total grip on the country’s politics.
The CPC won the majority of the seats in Katsina, but the PDP still managed to maintain its dominance of that volatile region’s politics.
To President Jonathan’s credit, he delivered clean elections.
The country’s mounting problems – rampant official corruption, decaying social and physical infrastructure, and growing ethnic and religious insurgencies in the northeast, central region, the southeast, and Niger Delta – are yet to be seriously tackled.
Having come to power in the revolt that overthrew the corrupt Shevardnadze, he resorted to the same Soviet-style techniques – intimidating and discrediting opponents, dispersing dissenters by force – to keep his opponents at bay.
In 1999, during the New York celebrations marking the tenth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, I myself heard Shevardnadze assert that Georgia had given the twentieth century two historic figures: “One who erected the Iron Curtain [Joseph Stalin], and one who tore it down” – meaning himself.
Yet there is some good news.
Ogarkov’s ineptness (and inept mendacity), together with the mounting failure since 1979 of the Soviet Union’s war in Afghanistan, exposed the system’s advanced decrepitude.
Putin’s military build-up and modernization of the past decade was also fueled by energy exports.
Indeed, his partners – particularly the other BRICS countries (Brazil, India, China, and South Africa) – are now unlikely to be able to turn a blind eye to his contempt for international law and for his neighbors’ national sovereignty, as they did during their recent Brazilian summit.
Although his motivation, at least in part, may have been a desire for social justice, Perón was, in effect, bribing the beneficiaries to support his own rise to power and wealth. With his beautiful and outspoken wife – a “woman of the people” – at his side, Perón was able to persuade voters in 1946 that, as President, he would fundamentally change the country.
As with Perón’s presidency, Putin’s began well. The public adored the new strongman as he flexed Russia’s political muscle abroad, punished the “dishonest” Yeltsin-era oligarchs, restricted the “irresponsible” media, and re-centralized power.
Perón’s final years may offer a worrying parallel.
But is this really true?
The Breakthrough Institute recently highlighted on its blog some startling – and important – research findings along these lines, published in August in The Journal of Physics by energy economist Harry Saunders and four colleagues from the US Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories.
The real fix to this problem will come when governments focus on research and development aimed at boosting the proportion of green energy sources in overall consumption.
Is all that not a little much for a potential ally? Can working with Assad possibly provide a sound basis for what is supposed to be a common effort?
But this argument is not valid, either. The state has already failed: Assad's regime controls only a fifth of Syria’s territory, and the remaining four-fifths will never willingly resubmit to its terrifying control.
In the aftermath of last week’s peace talks in Vienna – which convened the United States, Russia, Iran, China, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, Jordan, Lebanon, and key European Union members – that question becomes increasingly difficult.
His actions last week brought on the crisis that makes rescue necessary.
Within a few weeks the market forced Paulson’s hand and he had to take them over.
To prevent housing prices from overshooting on the downside, the number of foreclosures has to be kept to a minimum.
Making government funds available should also encourage the private sector to participate in recapitalizing the banking sector and bringing the financial crisis to a close.
While Prokhorov is one of several respected Russian oligarchs, Kudrin was the most respected member of the government.
But members of the US Senate, which must confirm McFaul’s nomination, would do well to ask him about Surkov, a man who has overseen the destruction of Russian democratic politics.
Although he claims that he will not leave politics completely, he now looks like just another oligarch who must choose between capitulation, emigration, and imprisonment. Kudrin’s future is no less obscure.
This is not only common sense, but has been verified by studies and statistical analyses.
It has become even drier in recent decades because of a decline in rainfall, which is probably the result, at least in part, of man-made climate change, caused mostly by energy use in rich countries.
Both people and livestock need assured water supplies.
Living standards could be improved significantly and rapidly through low-cost targeted investments in malaria control, school feeding programs, rainwater harvesting for drinking water, mobile health clinics, and boreholes for livestock and irrigation in appropriate locations.
On the Test for Severe Impairment, where scores can range from zero to 24, three-quarters of these patients scored zero.
So, for the past three months, Golubchuk has had a tube down his throat to help him breathe and another in his stomach to feed him.
If Golubchuk’s children can convince the court that their father is not suffering, the court might reasonably order the hospital to grant them custody of their father.
I suppose that censors never have much of a sense of humor, and that irony and parody are usually beyond their intellectual grasp.
They didn’t have to like Israel, provided that they weren’t too rude about America’s pro-Israel bias and its refusal to accept that insisting on Israel’s inalienable right to exist was not the same as allowing Israel to do whatever it wanted.
The European Union, for example, has been light on assisting the development of the rule of law, good policing, and representative institutions in the Arab world, despite a development and political compact with its governments.
How worried should businesses, investors, and policymakers around the world be about the end of near-zero interest rates and the start of the first monetary-tightening cycle since 2004-2008?
And even assuming that interest rates reach 1-1.5% by the end of 2016, they will still be very low by historic standards, both in absolute terms and relative to inflation.
First, the divergence of monetary policies between the US and other major economies is already universally understood and expected.
Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, and two cases do not constitute a statistically significant sample.
Fortunately, the United States’ foreign-policy elite finally seems ready to do something to protect Syria’s people.
And, in July alone, almost 50,000 migrants entered the European Union through Greece.
Third, the nuclear deal with Iran, despite facing continued scrutiny in Iran and the US, has raised hopes that the country could play an important role in pushing for a political solution in Syria.
After all, the only time he has been prepared to strike any kind of deal over the last four years was when he believed that the US was prepared to intervene militarily in response to his use of chemical weapons.
We now know that they are not.
The best-known tools for this are margin requirements and minimum capital requirements.
That is, an increase in the willingness to lend tends to increase the value of the collateral, and also improves the borrowers’ performance, thereby encouraging a relaxation of credit criteria.
Banks must pay for their implicit government guarantee by using less leverage and accepting restrictions on how they invest depositors’ money.
Shorting bonds by purchasing a CDS contract carries limited risk but almost unlimited profit potential, whereas selling a CDS contract offers limited profits but practically unlimited risks.
In contrast to the United States and Europe, where the growth outlook looked weak at best, emerging markets were expected to sustain their strong performance from the decade preceding the global financial crisis, and thus become the engine of the global economy.
Except for a handful of small countries that benefited from natural-resource bonanzas, all of the successful economies of the last six decades owe their growth to rapid industrialization.
The country has developed remarkable strengths in IT services, such as software and call centers.
As a result, the capacity of manufacturing to absorb labor has become much more limited.
Manufacturing industries will remain poor countries’ “escalator industries,” but the escalator will neither move as rapidly, nor go as high.
During the round-the-clock coverage of the nuclear drama, the specter of Chernobyl has been raised repeatedly.
We see coal as a polluting but reasonably “safe” energy source compared to nuclear energy.
Moreover, given that the plants are already paid for, waste facilities are already in place, and the high decommissioning cost will have to be paid regardless of timing, the actual operating costs are very low – half or lower per kilowatt-hour than the cost of the cheapest fossil fuels.
And, since the onset of the crisis, the G-20 countries – with France (and the United States) as driving forces – have been pressing for better regulation, governance, and accountability.
But recovering the billions of dollars stolen by corrupt leaders and officials in the developing world has so far proved to be a lengthy process.
In the developing world, $20 billion could finance 48,000 kilometers of two-lane paved roads, or provide treatment for 120 million people with HIV/AIDS for a full year.
Civil society should agitate for action and accountability.
At Citigroup, a majority of shareholders rejected managers’ pay at Citigroup – the first S&amp;P 500 company at which that happened.
In 1989, the Chinese Government sent troops to repress the country’s pro-democracy movement.
Let’s hope that Business Roundtable et al. v. SEC does not mean the same thing for shareholder democracy.
In a related effort to get its residents to know each other, the city government also facilitates street parties.
It wants those who live in the community after the present generation has gone to have the same opportunities for a good quality of life as today’s residents have.
Although later research has cast doubt on the existence of such dramatic differences, there is little doubt that being in a good mood makes people feel better about themselves and more likely to help others.
In America, for example, more than one in six workers who would like a full-time job can’t find one.
When demands for China to adjust its exchange rate began during George W. Bush’s administration, its multilateral trade surplus was small.
This is the real trade distortion in the global economy – one in which millions of poor people in developing countries are hurt as America helps some of the world’s richest farmers.
Imposing unilateral duties after unilaterally labeling China a “currency manipulator” would undermine the multilateral system, with little payoff.
This decline seems to have stopped, and the most recent data indicate that the bottom may have been reached.
The IMF, the World Bank, and other international financial institutions, such as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as the European Central Bank and the European Commission, have worked together to stabilize the situation.
That is why it has become so difficult for small and medium-sized companies to get new loans or to refinance existing loans.
This will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Some strident voices are even dismissing climate change as a hoax on a par with the Y2K computer bug.
Indeed, the Panel has more often been criticized for being far too conservative in its projections of, for example, the likely sea-level rise in the twenty-first century.
The fact is that the world would have to make a transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient future even if there were no climate change.
Anxiety levels may have come down, in board rooms and stock markets, but the daily drama for survival continues.  Indeed, for many people it has deepened, in the villages and streets of the world’s least-developed countries – particularly in Africa.
There are some encouraging signs.
This calls for a broadening of the IMF’s surveillance mandate beyond macroeconomic and monetary policies so that it can deal with wider financial and regulatory issues.  It means establishing a very high-level political council to take strategic decisions critical to global stability.  And it also requires reforming the voting system to ensure decisions command the support of the majority of members.
G-20 leaders need again to manage difficult domestic pressures, overcome narrow agendas and resist populist temptations – and prove the sceptics wrong.
Cities, then, represent the most important development challenge of all.
But the agreement fails to specify who will undertake what costs.
Will we, then, manage to sign a legal and binding agreement in Cancún? Will we be able to implement cooperation mechanisms between countries such as the UN’s Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries – the REDD program – so as to prevent deforestation and encourage technology transfer and financing?
They continue to assume that we live in an era of Western domination of world history.
Hence, the Nobel Peace Prize Committee has squandered a valuable opportunity to send out a message of hope to the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims, one that would have rid the world of the grand global illusion that peacemaking is a “white man’s burden.”
With a thin majority in the lower house and a narrow plurality in the upper house (which has adopted a censure resolution against Noda), the DPJ on its own is unable to pass fiscal and other legislation essential to running a government.
As a result, the public is paying increasing attention to the newly created Japan Restoration Party (JRP) and its populist leader, Osaka City Mayor Toru Hashimoto, a former governor of Osaka prefecture and the son of a minor Yakuza (mafioso).
In fact, the system’s resilience in absorbing huge disruptions – the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 earthquake – is one key reason for its survival.
Can the industry’s new champions, Apple and Google – not to mention titans in other tech sectors – avoid Nokia’s fate?
But Elop was not the only person at fault.
Why didn’t Nokia choose Android earlier? The short answer is money.
But there are steps they can take to prolong their success.
Herein lies the most important lesson in Nokia’s fall.
But, with China’s military build-up causing nervousness everywhere, and with North Korea a perpetual source of insecurity, many governments in the region are starting to work with outside powers.
Yet Indonesia is also trying to align itself with Asia’s rising power, China, by seeking greater defense and security cooperation.
Both India and China are each seeking greater influence over the strategically important country of Myanmar.
But now Japan’s political and economic influence in South East Asia is gradually declining, owing in part to its failure to exert influence over security and defense matters.
After the recent landmine blasts, by contrast, President Park Geun-hye would not back down from her demands that the North, which denied planting the mines, apologize.
Will Kim respond to that isolation recklessly, by continuing to antagonize the South, or pragmatically, by becoming more flexible?
Today’s young soldiers represent the so-called Jangmadang (“black market”) generation that came of age under the marketization process that followed the massive famine in the mid-1990s.
The accords represented an effort to improve East-West relations during the Cold War, and included an emphasis on human rights.
Indeed, none of the region’s key strategic players – China, the United States, and South Korea – seem to be adequately prepared for such a scenario.
A similar discussion needs to take place in the US.
With a trillion-dollar economy, world-class technology, a 500,000-strong military, and a vibrant, well-educated society, the country is capable of planning, manning, and paying for the aftermath of a peaceful end to the Kim regime.
Given the instability in North Korea, each country should define its role now.
What Kim does seem to have received is South Korea’s agreement to stop the broadcasts, which included some very telling personal criticism of him.
China has essentially washed its hands of its small neighbor.
Many South Koreans are not sure they are prepared to accept the responsibility of absorbing the North’s population.
Historical turning points are normally easier to identify in retrospect.
North Korea’s leaders have a history of aggressiveness, a demonstrated contempt for their people, and a record of selling just about anything (from drugs and counterfeit dollars to missile parts) to earn hard currency.
Initial reactions to North Korea’s nuclear test were uniformly critical, culminating (thus far) in UN Security Council Resolution 1718, which condemns the test, demands that North Korea resume full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and imposes a range of military, political, and economic sanctions.
The problem is that it would almost surely trigger a massive, costly war, and it would not necessarily succeed in destroying all of North Korea’s hidden capabilities.
North Korea’s Nuclear Shadow
Against this background, Fowle’s release, which apparently carried no quid pro quo, has been interpreted as a sign of the regime’s readiness to initiate a long-awaited dialogue with the United States.
After years of frustration, North Korea began to&nbsp;implement in 2007 what amounted to a “grand bargain.”
As General Curtis Scaparrotti, the top US military commander in South Korea, recently warned, North Korea may already have access, through Iran and Pakistan, to the expertise needed to miniaturize a nuclear device and mount it on a missile.
A dialogue with the deaf can be difficult; but a dialogue with an amnesiac can be no dialogue at all.
The gap, instead, reflects recent historical choices.
As such, North Korea’s economic recovery is vital for an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula.
But this expansion has not brought fundamental change to the two Koreas’ relationship.
As of today, the Six-Party Talks is the principal framework to open up the future of the North.
North Korea’s Powerful Weakness
In certain bargaining situations, weakness and the threat of collapse can be a source of power. To take a well-known example, if you owe a bank $1,000, the bank has power over you; but if you owe the bank $1 billion, you may have considerable bargaining power over the bank.
The signs of a change are intriguing.
SEOUL – Once again, tension is rising across Asia over North Korea’s missile program.
Indeed, the Bush administration’s unilateral behavior, including the dismantling of the 1994 Geneva Agreed Framework with North Korea, the hyping of an enriched uranium deal, and the infamous “axis of evil” speech, have all increased the paranoia of an already paranoid regime.
During the same period, there have been 10 South Korean presidents and 11 US presidents.
Strategic Clarity on North Korea
But rarely does a country pursue all of them, as North Korea evidently is.
For China, mending relations with its Southeast Asian neighbors, which have been damaged by territorial disputes, is a higher priority.
Giving one another access to deep thinking on the issue could be the best means to encourage cooperation and, most important, a doctrine of “no surprises.”
The Dear Sister Disappears
He removed leaders who could potentially oppose her, including such senior figures as Lee Yong-chul and Lee Je-gang.
But no one should mistake this for a Pyongyang Spring. Indeed, the regime’s efforts to hide, yet again, a severe food shortage demonstrate that its core values have not changed in the least.
By filing its claim with the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, Denmark has joined our era’s “great game”: the contest for economic control over a large part of the Arctic.
Under the terms of the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration, all of the countries bordering the Arctic Ocean agree to resolve their claims peacefully and based on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
And, in addition to the vast distances, there is the harsh climate.
Earlier this year, I visited the center for a fascinating exhibition on the first independent Norwegian constitution promulgated in 1814.
One of the writers of the constitution, Frederik Motzfeldt, argued that Jews would never assimilate themselves with the people of any country.
Now, too, the Enlightenment is often invoked as shorthand for the Western values that are supposedly in danger of “Islamization.”
But they are not yet in the majority, and the belief that the West is in imminent danger of being “Arabized” or “Islamized” is not quite yet mainstream.
BOGOTA, LIMA, SANTIAGO – International economic coordination is as necessary as it is elusive.
These economies face two serious problems.
To be sure, the re-commoditization of Latin America has causes that go beyond China’s exchange-rate policies.
To reduce their dependence on commodities they also have signed free-trade agreements with the US (inexplicably not approved by the US Congress in the case of Colombia).
Indeed, oil prices have been falling, not rising.
More important, Russia has not cut off natural-gas supplies to Western Europe, which would be a major shock for gas-dependent EU economies.
Markets tend to disregard the risks of events whose probability is hard to assess but that have a major impact on confidence when they do occur.
The interaction of any of these global factors with a variety of regional and local sources of geopolitical tension could be dangerously combustible.
If your debt becomes unsustainable because you borrowed too much to take long vacations or buy expensive appliances, your bad behavior is to blame.
Because a formal bankruptcy regime for governments does not exist (though Anne Krueger, the International Monetary Fund’s then-deputy managing director, proposed one more than a decade ago), countries have had to rely on a market-based approach to resolve excessive debt problems.
Second, if the holdouts are paid in full, the majority of creditors who accepted a haircut can request to be paid in full, too.
These forces loathe the alphabet soup of supra-national governance institutions – the EU, the UN, the WTO, and the IMF, among others – that globalization requires.
Worse, the eurozone may again be at risk: some countries (the United Kingdom) may exit the EU; others (the UK, Spain, and Belgium) eventually may break up.
Meanwhile, the Middle East remains a region mired in backwardness.
That ambition is not difficult to discern.
Indeed, now Armenia and Kyrgyzstan are in play.
In particular, the tension with Europe and the United States over Ukraine will shift Russia’s energy and raw-material exports – and the related pipelines – toward Asia and China.
Unfortunately, the sanctions that the US and Europe are imposing on Russia, though necessary, may merely reinforce the conviction among Putin and his nationalist Slavophile advisers that Russia’s future lies not in the West, but in a separate integration project in the East.
Near-zero policy rates encourage “carry trades” – debt-financed investment in higher-yielding risky assets such as longer-term government and private bonds, equities, commodities and currencies of countries with high interest rates.
According to Stein, only monetary policy (higher policy interest rates) “gets in all of the cracks” of the financial system and prevents asset bubbles.
Some risks now have a lower probability – even if they are not fully extinguished.
Thanks to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes” speech, new financial facilities to stabilize distressed sovereign debtors, and the beginning of a banking union, the eurozone is no longer on the verge of collapse.
For starters, there is the risk of a hard landing in China.
Fourth, the crises in some fragile emerging markets may worsen.
Investors may be right that these risks will not materialize in their more severe form, or that loose monetary policies in advanced economies and continued recovery will contain such risks.
In most advanced economies, bubbles are being inflated by very low short- and long-term interest rates.
They complain bitterly about regulators’ “interference” with the free market, property rights, and the sacrosanct ideal of home ownership.
But the higher home prices rise, the further they will fall – and the greater the collateral economic and financial damage will be – when the bubble deflates.
One push is for governments to provide for their people; the other calls for governments to stop restricting their people’s freedom, particularly their economic liberty. The first type of reform will likely only exacerbate the Arab world’s grave problems; the second offers hope for positive and sustainable change.
Such jobs are a liability for society, not an asset.
State handouts can be reliably financed only by controlling the economy’s productive sectors.  But in the Arab world, as everywhere else, this leads to theft, corruption, uncompetitive monopolies, a stifling of enterprise, and, eventually and inevitably, to decline and decay.
The 64th opening of the General Assembly asks us to rise to an exceptional moment.
To be sure, the issues are complex and difficult, especially those of financing adaptation and mitigation efforts in poorer countries.
The world is united on a third front, as well.
Yet listening to the world’s leaders speak, last week, I was struck by their passion, commitment, and collective determination to turn a page from a past of countries divided by narrow interests to nations united in the cause of a global common good.
The government convinced the Turkish Cypriots to make a leap of faith and vote in favor of the Annan plan in order to reunite the island.
No one – not the US, the EU, Turkey, Greece, or the two Cypriot communities – can afford to waste it.
Should the talks fail, the side that behaves in an uncompromising manner will bear full responsibility for dividing the island forever.
If it does not, the EU should take America to court.
But what is alleged to have happened was not a case of the US reciprocally countering supposed illegal activities by other states.
There is no other force holding it together.
Surveillance technology has advanced a great deal since 1961, when the Convention was concluded.
The world barely stirred.
But its credibility now hangs by a thread.
The nuclear-armed states will not sign on any time soon to any treaty that bans the use of their weapons under all circumstances.
That was a tragic missed opportunity, for a US-Soviet agreement, reached in what was still an essentially binary international system, might have had truly global meaning.
Unless conditions in the region change dramatically for the better, the creation of a WMD-free zone (WMDFZ) in the Middle East – an idea launched at the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in 2010 – might prove a stillborn initiative.
Indeed, Israel’s concept of “peace first and denuclearization last” was vindicated in the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty, which speaks of a WMDFZ as a goal “to be achieved in the context of a comprehensive, lasting and stable peace.”
Likewise, for all the effort put into improving America’s most important bilateral relationships – those with China and Russia – ties with both countries have become increasingly tense, owing most recently to the Kremlin’s intransigence over Syria and official Chinese behavior in the South China Sea.
Negotiations to “de-alert” the 2,000 nuclear weapons that remain at absurdly dangerous, Cold War-era launch readiness have never really started.
And it is not naïve to believe that non-proliferation and disarmament are inextricably connected: that so long as any state retains nuclear weapons, others will want them.
But the Scientists’ argument was sobering, and demands attention.
At the end of March, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak will host a follow-up meeting to Obama’s successful Nuclear Security Summit in 2010, which brought together 47 government leaders to agree on a comprehensive program aimed at securing all such materials within four years.
Third, sustaining high-level policy attention to the entire nuclear agenda requires an institutional setting.
The recent framework agreement on Iran’s nuclear program has had the opposite effect.
Iran’s leaders can thank George W. Bush.
Turkey is also engaging in strategic recalculations.
It is Iran’s geopolitical behavior, not its threshold nuclear status, that matters.
But the challenge does not end with reducing emissions.
Scientists have spent the last 60 years trying to figure out the best way to create these conditions.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility in California is getting impressive results by firing high-powered lasers at capsules of fuel, crushing the particles together to trigger fusion reactions.
Machines all over the world are reaching fusion temperatures and extending our technological capabilities.
Kecelakaan nuklir ini merupakan kejadian terburuk sejak krisis reaktor Chernobyl pada tahun 1986.
Sebagai permulaan, pemerintah dan industri harus memperlakukan keamanan nuklir sebagai proses perbaikan yang berkelanjutan dan bekerja untuk mengimbangi dengan ancaman dan tantangan yang ada.
Pengawasan yang efektif dapat menghilangkan perasaan mudah puas.
Penting sekali bagi kita untuk belajar dari Fukushima dan terapkan pembelajaran tersebut ke dalam strategi kita untuk memberantas terorisme nuklir.
In the last five-year review conference at the United Nations in 2005, only Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea were not participating – the first three have nuclear arsenals that are advanced, and the fourth’s is embryonic.
Having received at least tentative approval from the US for its policy, India still faces two further obstacles: an acceptable agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a 45-nation body that – until now – has barred nuclear trade with any nation that refuses to accept international nuclear standards.
Since World War II, strikes to halt nuclear activities have taken place exclusively in the Middle East: Iraq was struck by Iran (1980), Israel (1981), and the United States (1991, 2003), while Iraq bombed Iran (1984-87) and Israel (1991). But raids never generated significant radiological consequences, because plants were under construction, contained inconsequential amounts of nuclear material, had radioactive elements removed prior to the attack, or because the attacker missed the mark.
Authorities have distributed potassium iodide tablets to the nearby towns of Yerham, Dimona, and Aruar.
At that time, history provided odd support.
It could claim that closure demonstrates its commitment to reducing regional nuclear tensions, while sending a message about the wisdom of building reactors in the world’s most volatile region.
One fact is not in doubt: the NPT is the legal linchpin for the nuclear nonproliferation regime now signed and ratified by all but three nations – India, Pakistan, and Israel – and one drop-out, North Korea.
And then there is Iran.
Hence, the Soviet Union, the US, Egypt, and India decided that it is better to live with a nuclear-armed China, North Korea, Israel, and Pakistan, respectively, than risk war.
They do so with good reason.
We should be wary about defining nuclear security so narrowly.
Given the existence of a technologically advanced verification regime that can detect even small underground nuclear tests – what US Secretary of State John Kerry recently called “one of the great accomplishments of the modern world” – this is especially disappointing.
The nations of Asia have a particular affection for him, owing to the years he spent as a child in Indonesia.
But the future of security in the Pacific should not be left to US decision-makers alone.
According to Obama, “few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change.”
Pleas for action on climate change reflect fears that global warming might undermine agricultural production, especially in the developing world.
Sea levels are rising, but they have been rising at least since the early 1800’s.
Finally, it is simply wrong to say that storms are growing stronger every hurricane season.
If there is one bilateral relationship that the Bush administration is seen to have handled successfully, it is that with India.
America’s mistakes include the Patriot Act, the invasion of Iraq, the mishandling of Afghanistan, the torture committed at Abu Ghraib, and the prison at Guantánamo Bay.
A new vision of the US-India relationship would focus on global warming, the collapse of industrial agriculture, the widening gap between rich and poor, the conventional and nuclear arms race in Asia, and the intensification of ethnic and religious conflict.
Over the past three decades, five American presidents have struggled to figure out what to do about Iran.
The process could include appointing a US envoy to Iran.
Such an approach will require that each side exercise broad restraint and live with the ambiguity of working with a strong adversary to manage profound differences.
At their core lie Iran and its nuclear program.
America is fighting three wars in this region: in Iraq and Afghanistan, and – not to be forgotten! – the “war on terror” against Al Qaeda and its offshoots, a war that is closely linked to the interests and conflicts within this large region.
As for the Middle East conflict, the conflicting interests of Binyamin Netanyahu’s administration and the American government are becoming clear.
It is hard to believe that Netanyahu, of all Israeli prime ministers, would be the one to accept idly Iran’s entry into the nuclear club.
That is an unfamiliar position for a new US president.
But, unlike then, the countries that are accumulating the capital today are not spending it on consumption – remember the endless pictures of Saudi princes buying up real estate on the French Riviera – but on investment, infrastructure, and education.
Obama at Halftime
A combination of financial-sector recapitalization and rapid expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet prevented a complete credit lockup.
But it was responsible for allowing flawed expectations of a sharp recovery to pre-crisis levels of output and consumption to persist.
And, if successful over time, it might have made the rest of Obama’s agenda seem less overwhelming and more affordable.
The economic and political implications of this long-term trend have been widely discussed but left largely unattended, betraying the general lack of concern for distributional issues that shadows elites’ excessive faith in markets to provide beneficial outcomes.
But, more important, reality changed – in several ways.
The Republicans’ most ingenious trick was to use procedural measures to keep bills from being brought to a vote in the Senate, so that the public would ultimately blame “the stalemate in Washington” on Obama.
In his astonishingly swift rise, he was virtually alone – a Democrat, but not a creature of the Democratic Party, a politician of progressive instincts, but not an ideologue.
That, together with her avowed combativeness, has impaired coherent policymaking on critical issues like the Syrian crisis.
With a seemingly out-of-control John McCain taking over as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the situation is likely to become even more complicated.
When his staff presented carefully researched reasons for not joining the euro, many Europeans sneered.
And, in May 2010, the IMF endorsed the European authorities’ decision not to impose losses on Greece’s private creditors – a move that was reversed only after unprecedented fiscal belt-tightening sent the Greek economy into a tailspin.
If Obama’s words are to count, he must continue to push for the kind of deal Greece needs – one that errs on the side of too much debt forgiveness, rather than too little.
Locked in a war that has already cost nearly $1 trillion, the US has now shifted its focus to making peace with the enemy. It will not work.
Yet Obama has refused to designate the Taliban as a terrorist organization, leaving it off the list of terrorist networks mentioned, for example, in his recent joint statement with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Instead, his administration has sought to portray the Taliban as a moderate force that can be accommodated within Afghanistan’s political system.
And, fearing desertions to the Islamic State, it knows that giving Obama what he wants – a peace deal that enables him to declare victory before his term ends in January 2017 – would be its death knell.
And the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation of 2010 could have done much more to curtail large banks' power and limit the damage they can cause.
Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets, a pro-reform group, recently summed up the current situation well: “[A]dvisers can recommend investments that generate lucrative commissions for them, even though their clients get stuck with high fees, subpar performance, and unacceptably risky products."
(Warren joined Obama in unveiling the proposal to protect retirement savers.)
And, judging by the high number of distinguished and honorable professionals in the industry, many advisers, if not most, already do.
In Iran, then-President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate, offered what might have been a reasonable deal to curb the country’s nuclear program. But Bush and his team preferred to pressure Iran with sanctions and military threats, and any hope for a negotiated solution vanished when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad succeeded Khatami in 2005.
The Bush administration changed the regime in Iraq, but at a monumental cost that is still being paid. In contrast, Obama’s goal concerning Iran was modest and focused on denuclearization.
But it is also not the hermit state of the 1950s, having moved significantly toward a market economy in recent years. Indeed, by the early 2000s, more than four-fifths of an average North Korean’s household income comprised unofficial earnings from market activities.
Obama rejected his predecessor George W. Bush’s policy of isolating “rogue states,” recognizing that America’s only hope for influencing isolated countries’ behavior was to engage directly with them in a bilateral context.
The resumption of diplomatic relations with Myanmar was a critical feature of the Obama administration’s “rebalancing” toward Asia.
While the deal will stand or fall on the extent to which it pulls Iran back from the nuclear brink, it can also open the door to further bilateral negotiations on matters of common interest, from ending the war in Syria to cracking down on drug-running in Afghanistan.
But ensuring that the US can continue to lead in the twenty-first century will require a different kind of engagement.
Or else what, exactly? To be sure, the US government has coddled too many brutal dictators over the last half-century.
Unfortunately, this type of pressure could not work in China when its people demanded what other Asians had won.
So far, anti-American rhetoric has been remarkably muted in the uprisings sweeping the Middle East.
Building institutions that guarantee not only political liberties, but also the protection of minorities, as well as other liberal conditions, is difficult enough in countries where such institutions had once existed, as in post-communist Central Europe.
Obama seems to understand this.
Even the country’s proverbial inequality is beginning to shrink, albeit slowly, and lower-middle-class living standards are finally rising to where they should have been a decade ago.
Ever since, a country that had never truly experienced democratic rule has enjoyed all the charms and vicissitudes of competitive elections, legislative battles, and rotation in power.
Moreover, relations with the US, while important, are no longer paramount.
Obama will say all the right things during his visit, and will be cheered everywhere.
In his first official trip to Africa, US President Barack Obama is striking back in a novel way.
Like his predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Obama wants to avoid messy entanglements in Africa’s internal politics.
Ethnic relations in this highly diverse nation are as good as they are anywhere in the world.
In 1957, when legal segregation seemed entrenched in the US, Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, used the occasion of his country’s independence from Britain to highlight the injustices experienced daily by black Americans.
NEW YORK – It is hard for international observers of the United States to grasp the political paralysis that grips the country, and that seriously threatens America’s ability to solve its domestic problems and contribute to international problem solving.
On all of these questions, a middle ground of independents (neither Democrats nor Republicans) was more evenly divided.
Finally, policy paralysis around the US federal budget may be playing the biggest role of all in America’s incipient governance crisis. The US public is rabidly opposed to paying higher taxes, yet the trend level of taxation (at around 18% of national income) is not sufficient to pay for the core functions of government.
These paralyzing factors could intensify in the years ahead.
CAMBRIDGE – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vigorous foreign policy in the seven months since he took office has surprised observers. After inviting the leaders of Pakistan and other neighboring countries to his inauguration, he embarked on trips to China, Australia, and the United States.
Terrorism includes not just physical violence, but also assaults in cyberspace.
By contrast, the Modi government plans to pursue a pro-growth agenda that includes reducing bureaucratic delays, increasing infrastructure investment, stimulating manufacturing activity, and shifting to a simpler unified tax system.
Successful reform will be an important step in preventing the decline of American power.
Demographers portray a country in 2050 in which non-Hispanic whites will be only a slim majority.
Today, the US is the world’s third most populous country; 50 years from now it is still likely to be third (after only China and India).
Likewise, because the presence of many cultures creates avenues of connection with other countries, it helps to broaden Americans’ attitudes and views of the world in an era of globalization.
Moments like these are especially challenging for foreign policymakers, who must keep one eye on the world as it is and the other on the world as it might be in the future.
This is one of those times.
Third, there is at least one motivation behind the Arab revolts that permeates Western politics as well: the urge to forget the facts, the risks, and the future, and just throw the rascals out.
A dictator who has shown no concern for his people might actually prove quite talented at clinging to power.
We all now hope that President-elect Obama will provide the answers, not only in words, but also in actions.
Indeed, for the past seven years America’s foreign policy seems to have been conducted entirely through the prism of the “war on terror” and the Iraq war.
MILAN – The world’s developed economies, of which the United States is by far the largest and systemically most important, face a range of difficult political and social choices.
But this approach establishes a self-limiting pattern, because balance sheets are damaged, demand falters, and expectations have to be adjusted downward.
Obviously, it is impossible to reconcile all of these objectives.
The desire to avoid substantial tax increases (and to sustain consumption levels) will almost surely be reflected in a continuing shortfall of public-sector investment, in turn undermining long-term growth.&#160;
Obama’s China Card?
Moreover, the US is increasing its troop presence in the Pacific at a time when it already has more military force in the region than all other countries combined.
The US, like Australia, denies that all of this adds up to a policy of containment aimed at China.
None of this is meant to suggest that the Pacific region does not need America.
But more and more Australians are beginning to question the closeness and wisdom of our strategic ties to the US.
On the positive side of the ledger, Obama received ceremonial treatment not normally accorded to visiting foreign leaders, even other visiting US presidents, demonstrating the importance China’s government attached to the visit.
First, Obama did not openly criticize the Chinese government’s notorious human rights record, nor did he use his influence to persuade China to release any prisoner of conscience, as his US predecessors always did when visiting the country.
Moreover, what he did achieve looks superficial, while what he gave up seems substantial.
But talk is always cheaper than action.
The OECD, however, cautions governments not to consolidate too rapidly in a slow global recovery.
Moreover, the goal of balancing the primary budget in 2015 is hardly encouraging.
Let’s hope that the late conversion to tough deficit rhetoric gets a lot of play.
Abbas’ presidential term has expired, and elections are constantly being postponed.
The paradox here is double.
As he admitted in a recent interview with the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds, if pressured to concede on sacred Palestinian principles such as refugees, Jerusalem, and borders, he “would pack his suitcase and go away.”
Whatever route is taken, the great question today concerns the enigma that is Bibi Netanyahu, a would-be Churchill who believes that his mission is to thwart the designs of Iran’s evil new Shia empire, something which requires the goodwill of the international community, particularly of the Obama administration.
This is the chance of a lifetime to break through the cynicism that has pervaded American politics for decades.
Indeed, it is now.
Last year, he pledged to double US foreign aid by 2012, raising it to $50 billion a year.  (That still leaves the US lagging behind many European nations in the percentage of its national income that it gives in aid.)
This may be the greatest ethical challenge of the Obama presidency, but, because so much hangs on it, the way in which he responds to it is likely to play a decisive role in how his presidency will be judged.
He recognizes that the current political climate is not conducive to successful peace negotiations.
Furthermore, Obama’s embrace of Israel during his visit has undermined America’s role as an honest broker in future negotiations – and no credible candidate has surfaced to fill the position.
(Such low-hanging fruit has been increasingly scarce for the Republican Party, which is beleaguered by the perception that it has been hijacked by its most extreme elements.)
Strikingly energetic and self-confident, Obama has set out on a titanic journey to remake America’s economy and redress a broken and dysfunctional international system.
But Obama might soon realize that most of his predecessors started as believers in international cooperation, until events forced them to fall back on a strategy of confrontation.
Nor was North Korea impressed by Obama’s warnings that America might shoot down its rocket if they went ahead with their launch in defiance of the United Nations.
Nor would old enemies and competitors like Russia and China readily abandon the benefits of spoiling American plans.
This is the case in Lebanon with Hezbollah, in Palestine with Hamas, in Iraq with Moqtada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army and scores of other groups, with the Taliban and tribal warlords in Afghanistan, and with breakaway movements in Pakistan that have been emboldened by Pervez Musharaf’s resignation.
In the Middle East, Obama faces an almost impossible task of redressing historical and political ills.
Unlike the insoluble mess that he inherits in the broader Middle East, the road to a comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli dispute has already been paved, and no wheels would have to be reinvented.
These are all products of a deliberate policy.
While Europeans chew on that, they should also reflect on what the Cairo speech could mean for their own position in the Middle East.
In September, both at the United Nations and at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh, many countries agreed to work on Obama’s nuclear agenda.
The Obama administration is also consulting with Congress on when to re-submit the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which was rejected by the Senate 10 years ago.
In addition, North Korea violated its treaty obligations and exploded two crude devices.
Otherwise, reductions that create anxieties in other countries could lead them to develop their own weapons and thus increase the number of nuclear weapons states.
In general, Obama has pursued a policy of nuclear balance in which steps towards disarmament are accompanied by measures to retain America’s nuclear primacy.
In describing the New START Treaty, Obama administration officials stress the magnitude of the reductions.

Even with the lower ceilings found in the New START Treaty, the US will maintain thousands of nuclear weapons, as well as the long-standing US “strategic triad” of intercontinental land-based and submarine-launched ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable bombers.

The idea that Obama lacks a plan is right in a sense: nothing he has proposed has been big enough to boost the US economy’s painfully slow recovery from the 2007-9 recession, nor to insulate it from shocks coming from Europe and from weakening growth in the rest of the world.
That is why Obama could appoint the highly talented but politically unpopular Summers, the former president of Harvard University.
Sperling is just not very visible to the public.
Obama’s Democratic defenders counter that his policies staved off a second Great Depression, and that the US economy has been steadily working its way out of a deep hole ever since.
The maximum rate of economic contraction – a veritable freefall – came in the last quarter of 2008.
Given that difficulty, the right way to assess whether the fiscal stimulus enacted in January 2009 had a positive impact is to start with common sense.
Allowing for a wide range of uncertainty, the CBO estimates that the stimulus added 1.5-3.5% to GDP by the fourth quarter, relative to where it otherwise would have been.
Balancing hard-power relations with governments with soft-power support for democracy is like walking a tightrope.
Historically, rising states used smart-power strategies to good avail.
In 2007, President Hu Jintao proclaimed the importance of investing in China’s soft power.
Smart power is an important strategy for success in world politics, but no one said that it would be easy.
Why did President Lyndon Johnson’s administration steer the US into a war that looked like a lost cause even to its own officials? One possible explanation is that Johnson was thoroughly frightened by America’s right wing.
Indeed, the military has in effect militarized the arguments of the peace movement of the 1960’s.
So the politics of the Vietnam dilemma has been handed down to Obama virtually intact.
Had Obama become caught in the military’s somber spell? Or was his presence a silent public vow, as he makes his decisions, to keep his mind fixed on matters of life and death, rather than on the next election?
He has fallen desperately short in making real progress towards the Promised Land, in which America lives in peace with the Muslim world, thanks to an Israeli-Palestinian settlement; brings about a nuclear-free planet (a noble, yet entirely delusional pledge); gets Russia’s support in addressing other global problems; contains China’s quest to translate its growing economic power into major strategic gains; ends its two diversionary wars in Muslim countries; and leads a solid international alliance to cut short Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
After all, it was a Republican who produced the Reagan Plan, calling on Israel to withdraw to the 1967 borders.
Glory in foreign policy is no guarantee of future electoral gains.
Rather than stemming further erosion of the national commitment to educate the next generation, Obama has shifted his focus to the long-term goal of balancing the budget – even while the macroeconomic storm is still raging.
Moreover, Obama has joined George W. Bush in claiming executive powers that rival those claimed by Charles II of Britain in the seventeenth century.
Obama versus Romney on Jobs
Ultimately, Obama, bolstered by polls endorsing his plan, won partial passage of two AJA policies: a one-third cut in employees’ payroll taxes (he had proposed one-half), and an extension of unemployment benefits by about 60% of what he had recommended.
Altogether, Congress left at least one million jobs on the negotiating table, holding unemployed workers hostage to the outcome of November’s election.
Nor is Romney’s promise to enact immediate cuts in federal discretionary spending by an additional 5% likely to boost job growth, as he asserts.
न्यूयार्क – राष्ट्रपति बराक ओबामा का सिग्नेचर 2010 स्वास्थ्य-देखभाल सुधार, यूएस रोगी संरक्षण और किफ़ायती देखभाल अधिनियम (पेशेंट प्रोटेक्शन एंड अफ़ोर्डेबल केयर एक्ट), उन लाखों अमेरिकियों के लिए बीमा कवरेज का विस्तार करने में सफल रहा है जिन्हें यह अन्यथा उपलब्ध न हो पाता। और, आलोचकों की चेतावनियों के विपरीत, इससे स्वास्थ्य-देखभाल की लागतें बढ़ी नहीं हैं; वास्तव में, इस बात की कुछ आशा है कि लागत की वक्र रेखा अंततः नीचे की ओर झुक सकती है।
लेकिन, अमेरिका के फ़ार्मास्यूटिकल उद्योग की दृष्टि से TRIPS ने बहुत ज़्यादा काम नहीं किया। इस प्रकार, अमेरिका के साथ अपने व्यापार संबंध बढ़ाने की भारत सरकार की इच्छा इस उद्योग को, भारत को पेटेंट प्राप्त करना आसान बनाकर और कम-लागत वाली सामान्य दवाओं की उपलब्धता कम करने के लिए मजबूर करके वहाँ से काम आगे बढ़ाने का आदर्श अवसर देती है, जहाँ पर TRIPS ने इसे छोड़ दिया था।
चूँकि पेटेंट अनिवार्य रूप से सरकार द्वारा दिए जाने वाले एकाधिकार हैं, इसलिए वे उन्हीं अक्षमताओं और किराया वसूली के तरीके की ओर ले जाते हैं जैसा कि ऐसे किसी अन्य बाज़ार विरूपण में होता है। जो पेटेंट किसी दवा के मूल्य को सौ-गुना बढ़ा देता है, उसका बाज़ार पर 10,000% टैरिफ़ जितना असर होता है। ऐसे मामलों में, दवा कंपनियों को डॉक्टरों और जनता को अपने उत्पादों की सुरक्षा और प्रभावशीलता के बारे में गुमराह करने, और यहाँ तक कि अपनी दवाओं के अनुचित इस्तेमाल को बढ़ावा देने के लिए भारी प्रोत्साहन मिल जाता है, जिसके लिए वे अकसर डॉक्टरों को उन दवाइयों का नुस्ख़ा लिखने के लिए राजी करने के लिए नवाचारी प्रलोभनकारी भुगतान की विधि का इस्तेमाल करते हैं।
And yet, there is something odd about the European mania for a black American politician, even as we all know that a black president or prime minister (let alone one whose middle name is Hussein) is still unthinkable in Europe.
Still, the illusion was nice while it lasted, and Obamamania may contain an element of nostalgia, as well as hope.
But the real Europeans loved him for it.
Yet such projections could never entirely disguise a nagging anxiety.
That is why they are going crazy over Barack Obama’s election.
But, having said all that, the stimulus package gave the economy a necessary shot in the arm.
While it will presumably lack the public option many of us prefer, this is still a real achievement.
Medium-term fiscal reform, for its part, will be pushed by bond-market vigilantes.
The need then will be for more spending on education and training – the only thing that in the long run will make American workers more productive and reduce income inequality.
Government and commercial activities virtually ground to halt this spring as democracy activists, in alliance with politicians and lawmakers opposed to a third term, battled Obasanjo’s allies to thwart the proposed bill.
American, British, and French oil companies enjoyed a virtual monopoly of Nigeria’s oil industry.
But this has not stopped Abubakar, a formidable political operator, from launching his presidential bid, despite uncertainty over whether he will fight it out with his boss for control of the PDP machinery or decamp to another political party.
In his “State of the Union” address in February, US President Barack Obama proposed a “comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership” with Europe based on trade that is “fair and free.”
This is not the case for the EU and the US.
In the US, the disruption took the form of yet another fiscal mini-drama.
Such a global structure has the potential to encourage better medium-term alignments to reduce trade barriers, set proper standards, and enhance mutually beneficial cooperation.
Talks among state officials, the Obama administration, and the banks are currently focused on reported abuses in servicing mortgages, foreclosing on homes, and evicting their residents.
Banks want neither millions of negotiations nor, most importantly, the need to face the losses implied on their loan portfolio.
Start with the proposal made by Martin Feldstein, who recommends a trade: the government should reduce the value of mortgages when they are sufficiently underwater, with the government and the banks splitting the losses; in exchange, the borrower must agree that the new loan becomes “full recourse.”
And when the downside risks materialized, the losses were largely socialized – the primary reason why US public debt has soared in recent years.
NEW YORK – Samudera dan atmosfir terhubung dalam cara yang baru sedikit kita pahami.
Para ilmuwan yang mempelajari perubahan iklim sudah menunjukkan cara mengatasi permasalahan ini dengan menerapkan arahan yang jelas serta target pencapaian yang progresif.

Of Banks and Bailouts
The complexity of securitized pools of loans that were sold worldwide – bilaterally over the counter – as pieces of various tranches, meant that nobody was certain about who owned what or what it was worth.
Estimates of the losses on US loans and securities range from under $1 trillion to almost $4 trillion.
In addition to bailouts and toxic asset plans, governments worldwide want central banks to monitor macroeconomic and overall financial-sector risk (as opposed to focusing on individual firms).
Converting some portion of debt to equity under predetermined solvency-threatening conditions would provide an extra layer of protection.
Assuming complete success for the UK’s scheme, offshore wind power could produce more than 10% of the country’s electricity in 2020 and reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 22Mt, or 5%, per year. But the cost would also be phenomenal.
Finally, green-economy advocates promise a surfeit of green jobs. But economic research convincingly shows that while subsidies can buy extra jobs, they eventually have to be financed with increased taxes, costing an equal number of jobs elsewhere.
In recent weeks, ever since Kenya’s government announced that oil had been discovered in the Lake Turkana basin, more jokes have emerged.
The Turkana people are, as the joke suggests, as far away from Nairobi as one can be without being foreigners.
We have discovered oil!”
If Kenya approaches oil exploration and extraction in Turkana the way my Facebook friends have, and fails to implement these common-sense recommendations, a few years from now Kenyans might be sorry that oil was ever found.
The administration’s multi-pronged effort to postpone pain to US consumers, including super easy monetary and fiscal policy, only risks a greater crisis in the not-too-distant future. It is not at all hard to imagine the whole strategy boomeranging in early 2009, soon after the next US president takes office.
Secretary Paulson has emphasized that the US is “open for business” from sovereign wealth funds.
Even with the prevalence of dollar indexation across the region, exchange-rate appreciation would still help promote cheaper imports and higher living standards.
WASHINGTON, DC – The recent decline in oil prices is likely to have a major, largely positive impact on the global economy – even greater than most observers seem to recognize.
Saudi Arabia correctly reasoned that cutting output would not boost prices, but simply concede space for new players to step in and grab market share.
But advising countries simply to lower subsidies is often meaningless.
With the correct approach, today’s oil-price volatility could turn out to be a critical turning point on the path toward a more sustainable future, characterized by shared prosperity and genuine progress on poverty reduction.
आइए अब इतिहास पर नज़र डालें - विशेष रूप से, 1974 के बाद से ओपेक का पहली बार उद्भव होने पर मुद्रास्फीति-समायोजित तेल की कीमतों के इतिहास पर। इस इतिहास से कीमत निर्धारण की दो अलग-अलग व्यवस्थाओं का पता चलता है। 1974 से 1985 तक, अमेरिका के बेंचमार्क तेल की कीमत में आज के मूल्य की दृष्टि से $50 और $120 के बीच घट-बढ़ होती रही। 1986 से 2004 तक, इसमें $20 से $50 के बीच, आज के मूल्य की दृष्टि से $50 और $120 के बीच घट-बढ़ होती रही (1990 में कुवैत के आक्रमण और 1998 में  हुए रूसी अवमूल्यन के बाद थोड़े समय के लिए इस घट-बढ़ का स्वरूप कुछ हटकर रहा)। अंत में, 2005 से 2014 तक, तेल का कारोबार फिर से लगभग $50 से $120 की 1974-1985 की सीमा में होना शुरू हो गया, 2008-09 के वित्तीय संकट की अवधि के दौरान दो बहुत ही कम अवधि में हुए परिवर्तन इसके अपवाद हैं।

If the price remains at this level, it will have important implications – some good, some bad – for many countries around the world.
Lower demand reflects both the current weakness of economic activity, particularly in Europe and China, and, more important, the longer-term changes in technology, which will increase cars’ fuel efficiency and induce the use of solar power and other non-oil energy sources.
Unless expectations about the fundamentals of future supply and demand change, the rise in the interest rate will cause oil prices to fall further.
A further decline in the price of oil could have major geopolitical repercussions.
The bad news is that low prices will place even greater strains on the main oil-exporting countries.
Anticipation of post-sanctions Iranian oil production has also affected markets.
The muted effect of oil prices on global growth should not have come as a complete surprise.
Countries with floating exchange rates, including Colombia, Mexico, and Russia, have managed to adjust so far, despite facing significantly tighter fiscal constraints (though Russia’s situation remains especially vulnerable if low oil prices endure).
In fact, the secret to OPEC’s survival is its weakness, not its strength.
Higher prices fuel higher growth in these countries, which, accompanied by a population boom, leads to higher domestic energy consumption.
The rhetoric of energy independence in the oil-consuming countries makes the situation even worse: the oil-producing countries are building energy-intensive industries to guarantee a market for their oil once consuming nations wean themselves of imported oil.
This enables continued economic growth with high oil prices.

All else being equal, per capita incomes and productivity in countries with high proportions of elderly people tend to grow more slowly than in younger countries.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s demographic prospects look particularly bleak, as mushrooming populations of young people move into labor markets that cannot accommodate them.
In many EU countries, a much higher percentage of men than women are in the labor force.
If EU countries are to overcome the demographic challenges of the next half-century, they should not delay in preparing for them.
Like Chávez in Venezuela, Kirchner in Argentina, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and López Obrador in Mexico, President García belongs to the unreconstructed left that springs from the great Latin American populist tradition.
Indeed, domestic royalties on Bolivian gas production are being increased by more than 50%, and the price charged to Bolivia’s foreign clients may well be doubled.
Trading Away Human Rights
Indeed, the TPP’s emphasis on regulatory policies suggests that business interests will trump human rights.
In fact, a human-rights impact assessment would not be difficult to conduct: guiding principles presented to the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2011 explain how to do it.
The average North American meal now travels 2,400 kilometers (1,491 miles) from field to plate.
Unlike the top-down, technical solutions that policymakers have usually favored, a solution based on the concept of food as an entitlement, not a privilege, would involve – and empower – multiple actors.
In this sense, the social audits used by India’s Right to Food Campaign to assess compliance with court-mandated policies, such as the delivery of school meals, will be essential in the coming years.
Breakthrough crops, fertilizer subsidies, and aid campaigns may grab the headlines, but it is the right-to-food movement that holds the greatest promise for ending hunger.
China, 37 (38); 3.
By 2008, after London was awarded the 2012 Games, the total was £245 million, and stood at £264 million this year.
As for the others, the formula for success is fairly simple: select your potentially winning sports, pick the potential medalists in those sports, pour money into them, and stick with both the sports and the players until the medals roll in.
But it does lead to the second question: Can the methods that produce Olympic winners be applied elsewhere?
NEW YORK – China lobbied long and hard to host this summer’s Olympics, and thousands of Chinese literally danced in the streets when the decision was made to award Beijing the games.
It ignores what the country has accomplished, and it risks consequences that are inconsistent with what the critics themselves want to see.
There are also indications that China’s foreign policy is evolving.
Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, promoting more efficient energy use, taking action on climate change, and maintaining an open global economy – these and other tasks require Chinese participation, even cooperation, if globalization is not to overwhelm us all.
All of which brings us back to this summer’s events in Beijing.
The London games confirmed this trend. The Sino-American duopoly has loomed large in the medal count (22% of the total), but not outrageously so.
Clearly, Indian society has a complex relationship with sports.
But traditions can also be created.
While sports like running are relatively inexpensive, others – including gymnastics, swimming, and even more so team games and equestrian events – require significant resources.
That may sound like a resounding success: the mere announcement of the OMT scheme was enough to end the monetary union’s existential crisis. But, according to the German Constitutional Court, the policy violates European Union treaties – a ruling that the European Court of Justice is now reviewing.
Without central-bank involvement, investors’ panicky prophecy would be self-fulfilling, with the resulting spike in borrowing costs making it impossible for the government to repay its creditors. In other words, prohibiting the central bank from acting as lender of last resort can push solvent economies into a needless debt crisis, undermining output and employment.
The past two and a half years have been a disaster for peace, stability, and our sense of common humanity.
While it has allowed US President Barack Obama to back down from his threat of military intervention in response to the regime’s use of chemical weapons, it has also allowed Assad to continue to butcher his people.
Saudi Arabia is doing what it can to help.
Taking their cue from the sacred Rome Treaty’s reference to “ever closer union,” the European Commission’s theologians view every crisis as an opportunity to advance their federalist agenda.
First, the identity of the single European banking supervisor remains undecided, and the ECB has seen an opportunity for a power grab.
The second unresolved question is how to achieve a banking union in legal terms.
And Euroskeptic British politicians see this as an opportunity to recast the UK’s relationship with the EU; indeed, for some, it means a chance to negotiate an exit.
These losses then translate into reduced demand for American or German machine tools.
Moreover, if the stimulus succeeds and leads to an early recovery, the additional income gained may more than offset the increase in debt.
We should also remember that what growth there is in the world economy in 2009-2010 will come mostly from developing economies.
Moreover, fairness and security considerations demand that the most vulnerable, who had no role in the making of this crisis, receive support.
Tangible progress is needed in global trade negotiations in order to signal that the world economy will remain open.
The reaction by China’s public to the gory photos of the injured was furious.
Then, last August, during the Asian Cup soccer tournament, Chinese fans in Chongqing, Jinan, and Beijing hurled insults at the Japanese team – and bottles at their team bus.
The complexity and depth of these anti-Japanese sentiments helps sustain them and sets them apart from other, more fleeting and contradictory anti-foreign sentiments, such as those Chinese sometimes harbor towards Americans.
Recent developments suggest that a purely cooperative bilateral relationship is unlikely, to say the least.
He did eventually come to understand the nature and severity of the crisis, and then took decisive steps that contributed to halting the economic freefall.
Though Bernanke may be the best in his peer group, the fact is that the economic crisis decisively proved him and his peers to have been wrong.
Any dispassionate assessment of the Fed’s thinking before and well into the crisis shows that it failed to understand the economics of its own bailiwick, banking and financial markets.
Never before in the post-World War II era have American consumers been so weak for so long.
The 14-quarter growth trend from early 2008 to mid-2011 was cut from 0.5% to 0.2%; the bulk of the downward revision was concentrated in the first six quarters of this period – for which the estimate of the annualized consumption decline was doubled, from 1.1% to 2.2%.
And, while the personal saving rate rose to 5% of disposable income in the first half of 2011 from the rock-bottom 1.2% low hit in mid-2005, this is far short of the nearly 8% norm that prevailed during the last 30 years of the twentieth century.
Needless to say, such an outcome would spell serious trouble for America’s already-contentious deficit-and-debt debate.
One World, One Europe
Of course, this was not to be.
But, for national leaders in the EU whose last ambition is to have to deal with a new Jacques Delors, i.e., a man with ideas of his own, a cipher like Barroso is just the man for the job.
If Europeans were to set for themselves the goal of speaking with one voice, of having one representative in the spectrum of multilateral institutions – starting with the UN Security Council – they would be taken more seriously.
The online marketplaces built by Amazon and Alibaba, for example, have reshaped the retail landscape, partly by changing the local nature of retail markets.
And those who are employed are often stuck in roles that do not take full advantage of their skills.
In short, while online talent platforms cannot boost weak demand in advanced economies, solve complex development issues in the emerging world, or create better jobs across the board, they can have a major impact on seemingly intractable issues like unemployment, underemployment, and low job satisfaction.
In fact, the most sought-after engineers and software developers may not need to apply for jobs at all; companies are now increasingly recruiting “passive” candidates, sometimes forcing employers to increase the salaries of workers they want to retain.
TOKYO – The risk of global currency and trade wars is rising, with most economies now engaged in competitive devaluations.
Aside from the eurozone, the US, Japan, and the United Kingdom all need a weaker currency.
This intervention upset the EU, as it has put upward pressure on the euro at a time when the European Central Bank has placed interest rates on hold while the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the US Federal Reserve are easing monetary policy further.
The BoJ and the BoE are following suit, putting even more pressure on the eurozone, where a stubborn ECB would rather kill any chance of recovery for the PIIGS than do more QE, ostensibly owing to fears of a rise in inflation.
The online world, after all, has provided enormous opportunities to billions of denizens, largely because it has never been governed.
Doing this will require the key players responsible for the Internet’s openness to enter into a mix of voluntary and binding agreements that establish something akin to the rule of law.
Governments would not seek to create backdoors to access data if doing so would make the Internet less secure.
Without this action, announced on December 15, 1978, US-China relations could not have moved beyond a small, high-level connection with a limited agenda.
From a political point of view, there was the famed Taiwan lobby, one of the most powerful in the US, still dominated by the conservative wing of American politics.&
They wanted trade and other benefits of recognition, which would benefit both nations in those Cold War days, when China was fiercely hostile to the Soviet Union, with which it had almost gone to war only a few years earlier.
He believed China could leapfrog the lost years in which the world had passed it by, but only with American support.
In the late 1980's, it was fashionable in some Japanese policy circles to argue that the Pax Americana was over, to be replaced in Asia by Pax Japonica. America's economy seemed to be tanking, Japan's was soaring, and projections favored 2005 as the date when it would overtake the United States.
The closed nature of Japanese society and the dearth of ideas are partly attributable to the linguistic barrier.
Indeed, relations with China are Japan's most profound problem.
Many young Japanese - often the brightest and most entrepreneurial - demand to live in an open society, but the option they are choosing now is emigration.
Russia and China were among them.
The middle class is being hollowed out, and failed overseas adventures have discouraged the once “indispensable nation” from bearing the burden of global leadership.
The ruble is falling like a stone. It will be a tough winter in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Unfortunately, rather than leveling the playing field, the battle of ideas may skew US politics even further in favor of big business.
Even if researchers themselves are motivated by only the noblest of goals, their need for funding forces them to take into account profitability.
Fifteen years later, Jensen wrote a paper about the costs of excessive sensitivity of pay to performance.
A pro-business agenda aims at maximizing the profits of existing firms; a pro-market agenda, by contrast, seeks to encourage the best business conditions for everyone.
At the same time, Osama bin Laden released two audio statements condemning Western and Israeli attacks on Muslims and reiterating the need for violent warfare to liberate occupied Muslim territories from the infidels.
I see the army of the Cross in our land,
the establishment of “security” while chaining my wrists.
The term for those who have not joined Al Qaeda’s jihad is the “sitters” or the “immobile ones” ( qaaidun ).
If there is any surprise about bin Laden’s hideout, it is its location in a military town, Abbottabad, in the shadow of an army academy.
Pakistan’s homegrown Islamist militias continue to operate openly, and the Pakistani army and intelligence remain loath to sever their cozy ties with extremist and terrorist elements.
It is the self-styled secular generals who have reared the forces of jihad and fathered the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jalaluddin Haqqani militia, and other groups.
He promised that by 2015 the deficit would stand at only £37 billion, or 2.1% of GDP – equivalent to balancing current&nbsp;spending and revenue. Instead, the deficit for 2014-2015 is expected to be £97 billion.
People start behaving as though the books were balanced, ignoring the fact that they are not. When one believes the narrative, one acts in ways that make it come true.
Yes, the British economy has finally started to grow; and, yes, growth is expected to continue. But is there any reason to believe that the recovery will not be undermined by another five years of austerity, leading Osborne (or his successor) to postpone the deadline once again?
Of all the things she was forced to leave behind in Syria, her education was the one thing she could not afford to lose – not if she were ever going to realize her dream of being a doctor and avoid a future dictated by deprivation, violence, and loss.
The good news is that there is a growing global consensus on the centrality of schooling in breaking intergenerational cycles of inequality and building stronger, more stable societies.
Children with disabilities – most of whom never enter school in developing countries – see their already-minimal prospects decline even further in times of crisis.
Though many details remain to be discussed, the idea is gaining strength.
If these girls can show so much bravery in seeking an education, surely the international community can do more to make sure they succeed in obtaining one.
Put simply, we cannot achieve our vision of a prosperous, healthy, and peaceful world – the one that the SDGs aim to advance – without education.
Against this backdrop, participants at the Oslo Summit will be discussing how to generate the momentum and political will to broaden and deepen the donor base, and assess the highest-impact use of these funds.



In the last few months, enthusiasm about these countries’ post-2008 economic resilience and growth potential has given way to bleak forecasts, with economists like Ricardo Hausmann declaring that “the emerging-market party” is coming to an end.
At the same time, rapidly growing middle classes across the developing world would constitute a new source of demand.
Moreover, nothing was done in anticipation of the end of terms-of-trade gains in resource-rich countries like Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa, which have been facing rising wage costs and supply-capacity limits.
FRANKFURT – Many in the eurozone’s crisis countries complain that the source of their suffering is a rigid economic-austerity regime – including reductions in wages and pensions, tax increases, and soaring unemployment – imposed on them by Germany.
Such support can already be found via the various rescue mechanisms – above all, the European Stability Mechanism and the implicit guarantees of TARGET 2 – that have been erected since the crisis began.
And yet when the bailout is presented the other way around, with German taxpayers asked to backstop reckless Italian or Spanish banks, somehow it is supposed to be an act of solidarity. Legacy problems in national banking systems should be solved at the national level before the banking union moves forward.
Those who violate the rules consistently, and even announce that they will continue in their misbehavior, should not be allowed to blackmail the community and should ultimately consider leaving the club.
The following decade turned out to be one of, first, the war on terror and, later, the worst financial and economic crisis in almost a century – a time when virtually every developed economy experienced a long and deep recession.
So, not only is public debt set to increase much faster than nominal GDP growth, but governments will have to devote an increasing share of their revenues to interest payments.
Little wonder, then, that the Commission has issued a warning that crisis-related fiscal expansion and the aging population raise questions about the sustainability of public finances in the EU.
The NICE era is well and truly over.
In 2008, we started at 365% – and this calculation leaves out the pervasive use of derivatives, which was absent in the 1930’s.
Others – including me – failed to anticipate the extent of the rebound.
The globalization of financial markets that took place since the 1980’s allowed financial capital to move freely around the world, making it difficult to tax or regulate.
But governments are primarily concerned with their own economies.
How, then, can the rest of the world?
Nobody knows how much oil is left and how much it will cost to extract, but the peak of global oil production will probably be reached sometime in the next quarter century, perhaps even in the next few years.
The long history of climate change shows the risks of dramatic and abrupt changes over the course of but a few decades;
First, we should recognize that even as oil becomes scarce, other fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and unconventional sources such as shale and tar sands, will remain plentiful for centuries.
Reality will catch up with us.
Today, however, the US “empire” is in relative decline and fiscally over-stretched.
Global climate-change negotiations have similarly ended in failure, and disagreement reigns concerning how to address food and energy security amid a new scramble for global resources.
Finally, rising powers like China, India, and Brazil are far too focused on managing the next stage of their domestic development to bear the financial and political costs that come with new international responsibilities.
Indeed, Santorum’s view of the Netherlands as a kind of progressive dystopia has a slightly old-fashioned ring to it nowadays.

Editors, as well as reporters, at least tried to get the facts right.
There is no need to be exposed to different opinions, which are, in any case, considered to be propaganda.
Everything is political. That is the only truth that counts.
LONDON – The United Nations climate change conference, to be held in Copenhagen this December, should provide the climax to two years of international negotiations over a new global treaty aimed at addressing the causes and consequences of greenhouse-gas emissions.
Current greenhouse-gas levels are largely due to industrialization in the developed world since the nineteenth century.
Most developed countries are targeting reductions in annual emissions of at least 80% – relative to levels in 1990 – by 2050.
There is no real alternative. High-carbon growth is doomed, crippled by high prices for fossil fuels and killed off by the hostile physical environment that climate change will create.
It starts with an idea and requires a wide range of skills to bring that idea to fruition: synthesis or extraction of more or less complicated molecules, proof of their therapeutic effect in cell cultures and animals, testing for toxicity, and clinical studies.
There is therefore the risk that new drugs may in fact be worse than products already on the market.
As a result, certain drugs are used much more frequently than would be expected from their approved indications.
The challenge is how to produce new drugs that – because patients are too few or too poor – promise very limited returns.
When the heads of the EU’s member states met in Brussels to deal with the Greek crisis, the interbank market, which is decisive for the liquidity of financial institutions, had started to freeze, just like after the collapse of Lehmann Brothers in September 2008.
Leaders talk about “systemic risks” and the necessity of bailouts, but at the same time let those responsible for two consecutive systemic failures maintain the same global casino that twice brought the world near collapse.
Indeed, there are good reasons for believing that the Tea Party movement in the United States, connected as it is with the economic disaster that followed Lehman’s collapse, is one of the channels of the energy released by the crisis.
As a result of drought and heat, more than 500 wildfires have raged out of control, smothering Moscow in smoke and threatening several nuclear facilities.
But, viewed in a broader context, and using the logic of physics, important parts of the plot can be understood.
But the biggest change in Earth’s energy budget by far over the past hundred years is due to the accumulation in our atmosphere of greenhouse gases, which limit the exit of heat into space.
The problem is that a reduction in those extremes to which we are already well-adapted provides only modest benefits, whereas the new extremes to which we are not adapted can be devastating, as recent events in Pakistan show.
Clinging to the hope that it is all chance, and all natural, seems naive.
Germany is reunited and much of the Third World is growing faster than the First World, with computer software built in Bangalore and American graduate programs, including business schools, receiving thousands of application from smart Chinese students.
Indeed, the situation is even more absurd when G7 finance ministers meet: the central bank governors of France, Germany, and Italy still attend these meetings, even though their banks have been reduced to local branches of the European Central Bank, while the president of the ECB - these countries' real monetary authority - is a mere "invited guest."
The Europeans don't even seem to care very much about the job.
Obsolete dreams of grandeur should not be allowed to interfere with a realistic and fair distribution of power in the international arena.
To be fair, McCain never suggested that US troops will wage 100 years of war, as some of his critics claim.
Iraq’s government is demanding a withdrawal timetable from the US, not because it believes that Iraqi forces will be ready to take over soon, but to burnish its nationalist credentials ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections.
When these missions are accomplished – but not sooner – US forces should withdraw from Iraq.
A faster pace for rates hikes could have offset the slow start, but the ECB again erred on the side of caution.
Several frustrated hawks on the Governing Council are dead set against cutting interest rates precisely because they believe that, at 4%, rates already have been “cut” from the 5% or so levels they had expected to achieve.
Being out of step also focuses attention on the fact that the ECB is in danger of losing control over inflationary expectations. The US Federal Reserve can cut 100 basis points from the federal funds rate and not lose control over US inflationary expectations.
Conventional policy advice urges innovative monetary interventions bearing an ever expanding array of acronyms, even as governments are admonished to spend on “obvious” needs such as infrastructure.
The economists Tyler Cowen and Robert Gordon, on the other hand, argue that the problem is on the supply side.
In 2008, these elevated debt levels – in banks, businesses, households, and governments – sparked the financial crisis.
To be sure, the world’s economic outlook could still take a turn for the better.
Suddenly Americans - long champions of globalization - seem concerned about its adverse effects on their economy.
At the very least, this shows that markets by themselves do not quickly work to ensure that there is a job for everyone who wishes to work.
If America's highly trained engineers and computer specialists are unable to withstand the onslaught of outsourcing, what about those who are even less trained? Yes, America may be able to maintain a competitive advantage at the very top , the breakthrough research, the invention of the next laser.
This has, indeed, already happened in some developed countries: in the ten years that have passed since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, average real wages in the US have actually declined.
The Africans speak English, type at least 50 words a minute on a computer, take data from paper claim forms supplied by US health insurers via satellite in electronic form, put it into new digital forms, and ship them back to the US.
"There are real opportunities for outsourcing to Africa," he says, "but there are barriers, too."
The spread of mobile telephony has revolutionized ordinary life in a continent with the world's lowest penetration of fixed-line telephones.
The odds that Africa one day will receive a fair share of outsourcing jobs are improving.
Northern hostility, separatism, and racism toward the southerners are at the center of this split.
When al-Qaeda decided to take on the United States, it targeted the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, killing more than 260 people.
But African leaders have no interest in a real African Union.
At least they paid some attention to the mounting scientific evidence.     And certain principles set out in the 1992 Rio Framework Convention, including “common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities,” were affirmed.
European firms will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage relative to American firms, which bear no cost for their emissions.
Perhaps it is time to try another approach: a commitment by each country to raise the price of emissions (whether through a carbon tax or emissions caps) to an agreed level, say, $80 per ton.
Given the fundamental problems underlying it, Copenhagen’s failure should not be a surprise.
As these countries posted current-account deficits, northern European countries accumulated current-account surpluses, exposing a widening competitiveness gap.
While the decline in aggregate demand led to reduced imports, the combination of higher interest rates, lower public expenditure, tax increases, and wage deflation boosted unemployment and triggered recession.
But Van Rompuy’s minimal proposal may be insufficient.
And, by 3 p.m., the house must be ready for Sally’s graduation party.
In 2013, Sam’s day would have been far more difficult, stressful, and expensive.
Indeed, with certain institutions and industries benefiting when all of the system’s components – vehicles, roads, fuel stations, traffic laws, regulations, vehicle standards, and licensed drivers – work together, no transformational development has occurred in road transportation since Karl Benz invented the car and Henry Ford popularized it.
For Americans earning minimum wage ($7.25 per hour), time spent driving at a rate of 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour costs $0.24 per mile.
Owning Up to Israel’s Bomb
What is remarkable is that it has lasted so long.”
Here, a change in Iran’s pattern of behavior toward Israel is an absolute prerequisite.
By abandoning ambiguity and taking its own bomb out of the “basement,” Israel might be able to affirm its capacity for nuclear deterrence more convincingly, and, more importantly, enhance a serious debate about the urgency of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East.
Altogether, during 2000-2008, the top executive teams at Bear Stearns and Lehman cashed out about $1.1 billion and $850 million (in 2009 dollars), respectively.
It is important for financial firms – and firms in general – to reform compensation structures to ensure tighter alignment between executive payoffs and long-term results.
The first time was after the passage in 1994 of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), when the flow of finance to Mexico to build factories to export to the largest consumer market in the world was overwhelmed by the flow of capital headed to the United States in search of a friendlier investment climate.
Armed with that insight, the disease of the business cycle should be addressed in one or more of three ways.
But that, too, is not the situation today in the core economies of the North Atlantic.
Right now, the global economy is suffering a grand mal seizure of slack demand and high unemployment.
What Musharraf and his associates did not anticipate was that a large number of vanquished Taliban and their Al Qaeda supporters would slip into Pakistan. Among those who did was Osama bin Laden.
Worse still has been the impact on Pakistan’s ethnic make-up.
So, should Pakistan have refused to participate in the war on terror? No matter how it had reacted to the US request for help in eliminating the threat posed to its security by Al Qaeda and the Taliban, this fight would have arrived in Pakistan.
Both Musharraf and his supporters in Washington hoped that mainstream parties’ participation in the election would end Pakistan’s governance crisis and provide popular support for a decisive confrontation with the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
Musharraf, who regularly claims to act on the basis of a “Pakistan first” policy, must now let go of partisan objectives and form a national unity government led by a prime minister from the opposition.
Finally, it must begin a dialogue with Musharraf and the military on a permanent, constitutional separation of powers.
NEW DELHI – As US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bluntly told Pakistan in 2011 that “you can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.”
And, despite the increasing blowback from state-aided militancy, the generals remain too wedded to sponsoring terrorist groups that are under United Nations sanctions – including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) and the Haqqani network – to reverse course.
Earlier this month, Pakistani authorities aided a large public rally by Saeed in Lahore, including by running special trains to ferry in participants, so that the architect of the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack (among many others) could project himself as some sort of messiah of the Pakistani people.
As long as the military, intelligence, and nuclear establishments remain unaccountable to the civilian government, Pakistan, the region, and the world will continue to be at risk from the jihadist snake pit that the country has become.
According to senior Pakistani officials – including Sartaj Aziz, a key adviser on foreign affairs and national security – there was no agreement in the works when the stories appeared.
To be sure, the US government’s agenda would have some benefits for Pakistan.
Developed after the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament, the doctrine calls for Indian troops to move rapidly to occupy 300-500 square kilometers of Pakistani territory in the event of another terrorist attack. The occupation would end only when Pakistan formally relinquished its claim to Kashmir and dismantled all terrorist training camps operating within its borders.
Pakistan on the Precipice
But, having deftly out-maneuvered his opponents for three years, Zardari seems to have misread the current political environment, for Pakistan is not the same country in which his wife and father-in-law wielded power.
The Bush administration, eager to have a democratically elected government in Pakistan to continue the fight against terrorism, was believed to have brokered the agreement.
LAHORE – July was one of the roughest months in Pakistan’s history.
The ISI seemed to be keeping its lines of communications open to some Taliban in the hope that they could be used as a reserve force in case of another military confrontation with India or a precipitous American withdrawal from Afghanistan.
After hesitating, Zardari arrived in London three days later.
But will Pakistan’s military once more inject itself directly into the political arena, as it has done four times in the six decades since independence? Or will the country’s civilian leaders mend their ways?
Once the Shah left, the radical minority that was willing to fight and die for its cause devoured the “moderate majority,” establishing Islamist rule in short order.
Few Iranians had ever heard of Ayatollah Khomeini until 1978, but it didn’t take long for his message to electrify millions.
The desire to exact revenge on Musharraf for stifling democracy and failing to provide Bhutto with sufficient security will only inflame a political atmosphere that Pakistani liberals seek to de-radicalize.
But the costs are too high to be impulsive, and the storms of political Islam are difficult to forecast.
It was attended by then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and government ministers from several countries.
In the 1960’s, America wanted Pakistan to be on its side as it sought to contain the spread of communism in Asia.
That came to a sudden stop in 1949, as a result of the first of many trade wars that the two countries have fought.
Today’s democratic government has taken a step in this direction by amending Pakistan’s constitution.
Today, however, Pakistan’s military may not be prepared to act with the force and conviction it showed last time.
“Our institutions are working and democracy is functional,” Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told members of the Western press.
Officials are also aware that a change in the cabinet will be seen as mere window dressing unless people are shown that the government has a plan to rescue the economy from collapse and alleviate the burdens faced by ordinary people.
The campaign’s immediate impact consists in Pakistan’s determination to establish its authority in the area.
Moreover, violent militancy has now spread into Pakistan proper.
But thousands of fighters are thought to be dispersed in the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan, with many of them focused on operations in Afghanistan.
In Afghanistan today, they have an opportunity to reject that precedent and act on their mutual interest in stability.
Unless the West acts quickly, Bin Laden’s death is likely to result in a major realignment of world politics, driven in part by Pakistan’s shift from America’s strategic orbit to that of China.
In the meantime, Pakistan continues to pay the price for Bin Laden’s death, with his supporters striking a town not far from Islamabad just days later, killing more than 80 people.
Whether Shaikh can balance the IMF’s demands with ordinary people’s needs will not only determine the Pakistani economy’s direction, but will also have an enormous impact on how Pakistan and its citizens view the world.
Despite all the stakeholders – Pakistan’s army and government, as well as Western countries – knowing the scale of recent army action in Swat and Buner, millions of innocent people were left to fend for themselves as bombs rained down on them from the sky.
Pakistanis, on the other hand, are the people actually living with that threat.
Only occasionally was the fighting “officially” reported.
The Pakistani army would rather be seen as the country’s savior than own up to its own shortsightedness and make clear whether it has decided to change course by obeying the constitution.
As the Oslo Summit on Education for Development approaches, I remain firm in my commitment to securing the right to a high-quality education for every child in Pakistan – especially for girls, who have long faced high barriers to education. But there remain considerable obstacles to fulfilling that commitment.
Those steps include cooperation with provincial governments – which bear the primary responsibility for primary and secondary education in Pakistan – to devise a roadmap for universal enrollment. In order to improve the quality of teaching and learning, we are working not only to expand facilities for teacher training, but also to draw more talented people to the profession by recognizing and honoring the service of teachers.
For Pakistan, education is not merely a priority – it is a policy imperative.
Because Arabic makes no distinction between chairman and president, the Israelis accepted use of the Arabic word rayyes in the official English text.
At the same time, no PLO official is likely to seek the presidency without Abbas’s approval, which he will withhold until a new mechanism for ending the occupation is found.
Finally, there is Nasser al-Qudwa, the former PLO representative at the United Nations.
But the reality is more complicated, and marked by repeated failures to create a coherent body politic, even when historical opportunities beckoned.
More Palestinians were killed by contending militias than by the British army or the Jewish self-defense forces.
The more moderate Haifa Arabs tried, not very successfully, to stay out of the fray.
To be sure, there is a lot of blame to go around.
It is ironic that Netanyahu, of all people, is accusing anyone of incitement.
And that anger is already intense, especially among young Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.
The two-state solution might not be particularly attractive to either party anymore; but a binational solution, at least as it is unfolding these days, would be a living nightmare.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now set his conditions for dialogue.
Abbas must also share power with more disciplined, younger leaders.
Moreover, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia – the three main Sunni Muslim regimes – are concerned that Gaza could provide a base for their regional non-Arab foe, Shiite Iran.
Ever protective of his position as sole leader of the Palestinian people, Arafat sought to block any means by which a potential rival could challenge him.
Abbas will thus need to find support within this rising generation of nationalist leaders if he is to succeed.
Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad are highly disciplined organizations, exercising tight control over their political and military wings.
Israel must also free Palestinian prisoners, remove all checkpoints between Palestinian villages and town, and redeploy its forces to positions held prior to September 28, 2000, in accordance with phase I of the Road Map.
As a result, one thing that both Israelis and Palestinians agree on is that the proximity talks will most likely lead nowhere, so both sides are currently busy ensuring that the other side will be blamed for the failure.
It might even force Israel to make decisions that until now it found easier to avoid.
Palestinians identify strongly with the civil rights movement in the United States.
Yet we made this historic compromise because we believed that doing so would bring us to the threshold of liberty.
Not only has Israel failed to halt its settlement activity since Annapolis – in violation of international law and its renewed road map commitments – but it has actually accelerated such activity.
Our Declaration of Independence is now twenty years old. The Arab Peace Initiative has been collecting dust for over six years.
Moreover, men occupy all 23 seats on the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Governing Council.
But MEPs then failed to propose a plausible female alternative, leaving the ECB understaffed for weeks during the eurozone sovereign-debt crisis.
Neither Yellen nor Flug was held back by a lack of academic credentials – both are accomplished scholars – or by the catch-all charge of having “limited experience.”
To be sure, the selection of the 41-year-old Mogherini scores well for gender, age, and political affiliation.
So it is disturbing, to say the least, that with Ukraine at war with Russia, and the Middle East in a spiraling crisis of fanaticism, Europe’s leaders did not seek a candidate with a proven ability to forge an effective foreign policy from different – and often opposite – positions.
Both women would have been more convincing appointments, particularly to those, like Vladimir Putin, who do not wish the EU well.
Is the Italian government really so eager to take the lead on EU foreign policy? If so, where is the plan?
Roughly 50,000 North Korean workers are employed in 123 factories that produce about $450 million worth of goods (mainly textiles, shoes, and household goods).
But political and historical tensions continue to shape daily life in Kaesong, where companies operate under the constant threat that North Korea, for whatever reason, will react rashly, even abandoning the joint project altogether.
Detailed packing instructions were issued, informing us that we could not bring radios, mobile phones, wireless devices, printed materials, photos, cassette tapes, or DVDs.
Nonetheless, our pre-trip “indoctrination” stifled our reactions, regrettably preventing us from trying harder to reach out to the workers we encountered – an experience that seemed to exemplify the difficulty of bringing North Korea into the international community.
Governments around the world communicated with their citizens using social-media platforms: the United Kingdom’s embassy in France tweeted information for travelers, and the United States’ embassy there provided updates via Facebook.
According to unpublished Ipsos MORI research that was made available to me recently, when it comes to judging a company, honesty and integrity are more important than ever. Consumer confidence is being steadily eroded by a number of factors that lead people to question the extent to which they are valued.
CAMBRIDGE – How should one evaluate the agreement reached in Paris this month at the United Nations climate change conference? No sooner was the deal announced on December 12 than the debate erupted.
That had to change, partly because it is in developing countries, not the advanced economies, that emisssions are growing the fastest.
This is important because it is cheaper to pay a poor country to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants than it is to shut down an existing plant in a rich country.
This was a reasonable outcome in a difficult situation.
But the best way to address these fairness concerns is through the agreed emissions targets.
It is no such thing.
So, the extra 0.7°C rise is simply made up: climate policies can’t take credit for reducing it, because it was never going to happen in the first place.
Just 12 years later, great expectations were met with utter failure at the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen.
Many environmental campaigners are outraged by my scientific analysis showing how little Paris will matter.
I did not include this promise in my calculations, because for now it is mostly political grandstanding, being at least 15-20 years away from having any real-world impact.
OSLO – In the early 1990s, when I was Prime Minister of Norway, I once found myself debating sustainable development with an opposition leader who insisted that I tell him the government’s single most important priority in that field.
There is no guarantee that the agreement reached in Paris will work.
By that year, at least 27% of the EU’s energy is to come from renewable sources.
That, I might have told my opponent a generation ago, is the positive side of everything being connected.
Mengingat lambatnya kemajuan sejak konferensi perubahan iklim PBB yang pertama pada tahun 1995, perjanjijan apapun yang melibatkan semua anggota Konvensi Kerangka Kerja Perubahan Iklim PBB akan dianggap sebagai kesuksesan bersejarah.
Meskipun semua negara bersungguh-sungguh memenuhi janjinya, dunia akan mengalami kenaikan suhu setidaknya 3°C.
Dengan demikian, kebangkitan pendekatan bottom-up dalam perjuangan melawan perubahan iklim merupakan kemajuan yang berharga.
In the next 15 years, the world’s cities are set to grow dramatically, becoming home to 60% of the world’s 8.5 billion people.
Upending the status quo will be no easy feat.
Spurred by increased public awareness and mounting evidence that national economies can reap net benefits from policies to mitigate climate change, governments worldwide are pledging to do so – and taking to multilateral forums to display those commitments.
Already, this new model has helped to encourage national participation and enhance transparency, with national policies being published openly on the UNFCCC website.
The G-7 has recognized that decarbonization – the only safe haven from disastrous climate change – is the ultimate goal this century.
There are two paths to 2030.
We need to get to around 50 grams per kilowatt-hour by 2050, not 500 grams per kilowatt-hour.
The allure of the short-term fix is very powerful, especially to politicians watching the election cycle.
PARIS – “France’s 9/11.”
Both cities incarnate a similar universal dream.
At the time, I felt that it was a dangerous and unnecessary – and thus politically irresponsible – provocation.
But how long will national unity prevail? The scars of colonialism are fresher in France than anywhere else in Europe; the country has Europe’s largest Muslim minority; and, with moderates seeming particularly weak and divided, the extreme right is cresting in opinion polls.
The cause remains unknown, preventing us from arresting the disease’s development – though environmental and occupational factors loom large in recent research.
There is no treatment to slow the inevitable progression of the disease, and we do not know why the dopamine-generating brain cells begin to die off.
In the 1980s, six drug addicts developed acute Parkinson-like symptoms after accidentally injecting drugs contaminated with MPTP, which is structurally similar to the pesticide paraquat.
There is some evidence of increased risk associated with exposure to trichloroethylene, commonly used in the textile industry and in the manufacture of pesticides and other chemicals.
Nowadays the two largest parties can rarely hope to muster two-thirds of the popular vote. Not infrequently they have to form a “grand coalition.”
In some cases, they are individuals like President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela (and other Latin American leaders) or Italy’s ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
It does not take long for voters to discover that the promises of populists were empty.
Existing parties urgently need to recapture the support of citizens.
The Musharraf-allied faction of the Muslim League party (PML-Q) came in third, polling only 15%, despite the assistance of surgical vote-rigging.
Sharif has called for Pakistan’s foreign policy to be debated in parliament, but supports continued cooperation with the United States.
Vice President Dick Cheney’s office also is reportedly playing an active role.
So what is to be done about the “grey zone” to Europe’s east – the six countries that now lie between the EU and Russia? Inaction is unacceptable.
Georgia’s Mikheil Saakashvili is dealing with domestic protests after his disastrous military misadventure in August 2008.
To be sure, the EU’s technocratic focus on structural reforms is having some effect in the region.
The EU pledges to help set up “Western-type public institutions” and to transform the Eastern economies through comprehensive free-trade agreements.
Not only do more than 190 countries now belong to the UN; publicly funded international institutions have proliferated, with not one multilateral institution having been shuttered since WWII.
For example, embedding sunset clauses in the governance structures of publicly funded international institutions would ensure regular reviews of organizational performance and purpose.
As outcomes improve, international bodies’ legitimacy would be strengthened, which over time would enhance countries’ willingness to delegate powers to them.
But if governments, businesses, and civil society work together, they are feasible – promising a more sustainable, inclusive, and prosperous future for all.
Bachelet has also vowed to reform the tax system to reduce inequality, strengthen the state’s role in the pension system, and improve the quality and coverage of the health-care system. She has even promised a new constitution.
Some critics have warned that a hard left turn awaits Chile under Bachelet.
But it has only recently been acknowledged as having the continent’s largest economy – 26th in the world – following the release of “rebased” data putting GDP at $510 billion last year.
Despite widespread poverty and low (though improving) productivity in almost all industries outside of the resources sector, Nigeria has a rapidly growing consumer class that will play an increasingly important role in driving growth.
The spate of Internet startups that have emerged in Nigeria demonstrates that the skills are there, and tapping Nigeria’s diaspora can augment that talent pool.
किगाली - यह स्वप्न कि इक्कीसवीं सदी ‘अफ्रीकी सदी’ होगी अपने आप में शक्तिशाली और मदहोशकारी कल्पना है.


Reading The Samuelson Sampler, it is extraordinary to realize just how confident economists of his generation were that the New Economics (as the Keynesian approach was called in America) had solved the problem of depression and mass unemployment.
The Republican Richard Nixon was elected US President in 1968 on a platform of scaling down the Democrats’ expensive Great Society programs.
How can we have full employment and also price stability?”
Instead, they have relied on monetary expansion, which is politically more acceptable, but also much weaker in its effects, as it is undermined – just as Keynes predicted – by “several slips between the cup and the lip.”
In other words, “real” microeconomic thinking should be left to the experts.
A case in point is the economics of two-sided markets, which involve competition between platforms whose principal “product” consists in connecting two categories of users, who then offer each other network benefits.
In short, with a solid understanding of the difference between complements and substitutes, one can do almost everything the fancy models do – without hiring a single expensive expert.
Given scarce public funds and fiscal constraints, to increase spending, users must cover a higher share of the costs.
One approach is to create policies that raise the standards of unreliable transport and logistics companies.
The congestion and urban chaos that is typical in a port area, for example, must be eliminated through better planning.
These sorts of reforms bring massive returns relative to the investment required to finance them.
Just as Facebook “friends” come in varying degrees of intensity, quality, and symmetry, so does attention.
Juan and Alice exchanging attention may or may not be a fair trade, depending on their relative “value”: Is Alice extraordinarily beautiful?
That kind of attention can be valued by looking at the premium that people pay for it.
In response, many companies are now beginning to provide metrics to their customers for their behavior vis-à-vis that particular vendor.
This is the only prudent stance for South Korea to adopt when face-to-face negotiations with the North begin on February 8.
Economic failure, chronic food shortages, mounting public distrust of and animosity toward Kim’s government, and an apparent reluctance within elements of the North Korean military to go to war all point to the regime’s increasing fragility.
Moreover, nuclear brinkmanship is a particularly poor tactic, since Kim’s behavior is now becoming fused in American minds with arguably the most serious strategic threat on the US agenda: Iran’s push to secure nuclear weapons of its own.
Assuming that China does not approve of this unholy alliance, it has a responsibility to call a halt to these exchanges.
The number of illegal Jewish settlements and settlers has more than doubled in the areas Israel occupied in 1967.
Instead, Netanyahu stuck his fingers in America’s eyes, counting on the Republicans’ mid-term election victory to help him afterwards.
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s latest chapter in his two-year plan – the “home stretch to freedom” – will be complete in August 2011.
The international community’s old approach was to prioritize stability over democracy and pursue Israeli-Arab peace on a completely separate diplomatic track.
The US should not be selective in its support for freedom and democracy.
Bad perceptions only complicate future peace efforts, making a breakthrough even less likely.
Despite the fragile ceasefire in Lebanon, the risks of a widening war in the Middle East remain.
This approach continues despite its persistent failure.
The war party appears to be trying to whip up American public opinion in support of a wider conflict.
What unites us is vastly greater than what divides us.
JERUSALEM – Not since the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks during President Bill Clinton’s last days in the White House has the Middle East seen such a frenetic pace of peace diplomacy as it is seeing today.
Ehud Olmert, an especially unpopular prime minister whose days leading the government are probably numbered, lacks the legitimacy to throw the country into another bloody war, which given conditions in Gaza would be both costly and inconclusive.
After all, it was tiny Qatar that brokered Lebanon’s domestic settlement, Egypt that mediated the Gaza cease-fire, and Turkey that is facilitating the Israeli-Syrian talks.
Peace or Poison
The Nazis looked at Jews as a strain of “microbes,” and it was for this reason that they wanted to destroy them so brutally and meticulously.
If Iran gains nuclear weapons, it may, like Nazi Germany before it, be engulfed by murderous folly, threatening disaster for Israel.
The Palestinian leadership knows that if Iran ever launches a nuclear attack against Israel, their people would suffer terribly as well.
For Palestinians, the first step in real peace talks must include some accord on the basic issues of borders and security.
Former United States senator George Mitchell represents a relatively neutral third party supervising the current talks.
But no sooner had the parties left Washington after the talks broke down than Clinton joined Israel's then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak in blaming the Palestinians.
But, until that happy day arrives, or at least until the two sides have reached the contours of an agreement, direct talks and photo opportunities should be considered counter-productive.
Unlike in other countries, where guerrillas pursued exclusively political demands, Colombia’s guerilla groups became involved in drug trafficking, which transformed them into lethal institutional monsters, one part subversive organization and one part criminal mafia.
The government’s commitment to the fight against terrorism has already caused FARC’s membership to plummet, from more than 20,000 a decade ago to little more than 8,000 today.
But, given that the guerrillas have thwarted Colombians’ hopes in the past, we are approaching the negotiations with cautious optimism.
Reaching an agreement with the FARC to end the conflict – which implies the group’s disarmament and demobilization – would allow Colombia’s star to shine more brightly than ever.
The conflict in Northern Ireland was always territorial: not even the most radical Irish Republican group ever denied the legitimacy of Great Britain – only its rule over the six northern provinces of what they consider United Ireland.  The crux of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, by contrast, only partly concerns Israel’s borders.
Now that the talks are to begin, will they achieve anything substantial, or will the summit in Washington merely be another photo opportunity, like President George W. Bush’s Annapolis summit in 2007? Only an unreconstructed optimist would give the talks more than a 50% chance of succeeding.
The failure to reach agreement under such apparently auspicious conditions does not bode well for the coming talks.
Obama’s projected budgets do not change that.
It is easy to see how the persistence of instability in Iraq, Iranian influence, and al-Qaeda’s presence will lead American policymakers to take the “safe” route of continued military involvement.
After one recent disaster, in which more than 100 civilians died, the Pentagon immediately insisted that such bombing operations would continue.
Before investing hundreds of billions of dollars more in failing military operations, the Obama administration should re-think its policy and lay out a viable strategy to US citizens and the world.
This policy change is a necessary parallel to the military action now taking place.
Because the main short-term challenge in any transition to peace is national reconciliation, the political objective of peace should prevail at all times over the economic or financial objective of development if the two ever clash, as they often do.
In the case of Afghanistan, it may also require a sharp reduction in Taliban financing from drug-related activities, as well as targeted military operations to destroy insurgency hideouts in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The Annapolis peace conference ended a seven-year freeze on negotiations, with President George W. Bush asking the conflict’s main protagonists to reach an agreement by the end of 2008.
Infrastructure investment would then follow. 
It points to a stark truth: In a shockingly short time, we have become completely dependent on the Internet, a frontier we are only beginning to comprehend, let alone map and regulate.
But not everyone was convinced.
Lobbyists sought to water down the proposed legislation, with telecommunications companies particularly opposed to its net-neutrality provisions.
But with the Internet, mobile technologies, and social media all but eliminating such costs in many sectors, this economic structure is bound to change.
And the peer-to-peer lending market, which bypasses banks and their hefty hidden fees, surpassed the $1 billion mark in early 2012.
Recognizing these benefits, some communities are actively supporting the maker movement and accelerating the development of frugal economies.
Traditional companies must get on board – or risk becoming obsolete.
Women and children suffer the most in times of conflict.
At the same time, the Russian government must be pressured to pull out of the Caucasus and let people there decide their future for themselves.
This means that some people know more about some things than other people.
The lemons squeeze out the oranges.
But just as in used-car and insurance markets, asymmetric information in finance leads to trouble.
The theorists of asymmetric information occupy a deviant branch of mainstream economics.
Herd behavior arises, Keynes thought, not from attempts to deceive, but from the fact that, in the face of the unknown, we seek safety in numbers.
It is known that Chinese leaders had hoped that Kim Jong-il would survive long enough to consolidate support among the country’s various factions for the succession of his son, Kim Jong-un.
In turn, the EU initiated an extensive humanitarian aid project.
Is that possible? Could it be done quickly enough to boost other regional players’ confidence that the country’s evolution will be predictable?
In the case of North Korea, where nuclear arms are in play, it cannot afford to be.
We may have a superficial check-box understanding of what the companies behind this convenience do with our data; but, beyond the marketing, the actual people running these organizations are faceless and nameless.
Recently, hackers misappropriated photos sent via Snapchat, a service used primarily by young people that promises auto-deletion of all files upon viewing.
Consumers believe or expect that someone somewhere is keeping an eye on this, but who exactly would that be?
The Challenge of Medical Empowerment
People who do these things are healthier on average.
Yet we seem to be heading toward a world in which self-anointed saints and blamers face off against supposed sinners and suspects.
BUT SO WHAT?
Statistically, that is a known association.
Musharraf may be counting on the army, his primary constituency, to bail him out of this crisis.
Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid, and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaeda in the region, its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best.
Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy.
This perverse strategy sounds almost unbelievable.
Jamia Hafsa students in Islamabad demonstrating for enforcement of Islamic law, March 2007.
In a radio broadcast on April 12, the clerics issued a threat: “ There will be suicide blasts in the nook and cranny of the country.
There is no harm in it. There are far more horrible punishments in the hereafter for such women.
The Case for Better Government
The problem for governments, more often than not, is that in attempting to respond to and reconcile often conflicting individual, family, and national needs, their ability to deliver results efficiently and effectively has declined.
Globalization – the breaking down of national boundaries and the integration of economies across continents – has resulted in burgeoning demands on governments at the same time that their ability to provide answers has been reduced.
Since the demise of the Doha Round, the WTO’s standing as a multilateral negotiating forum has declined sharply, salvaged in part by the recent agreement in Bali.
GLENDALE, CALIFORNIA – Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II are the odd couple of modern Roman Catholicism.
But that does not mean that it will be smooth sailing.
In recent decades, lay managers and workers in the church’s network of schools, hospitals, and social-service providers have largely replaced priests and nuns.
At the same time, Francis’s Jesuit background has instilled in him a certain independence and flair for the quirky (like nonchalantly sanctifying John XXIII and John Paul II in one fell swoop).
Different answers to that question are possible.
Three Israeli civilians have been killed by rocket or mortar fire from Gaza, and 64 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground invasion began.
In contrast to previous episodes, Arab countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have been very restrained in their criticism of Israel, though perhaps less for moral reasons and more because they regard militant Islam as a graver threat than Israel to their own regimes.
We can acknowledge that Israel has made some efforts to do that, but we must still say: It is not enough.
Once Newman had an idea, it seems, he liked to work out all of the variations.
In a 1987 interview with a group of art critics, Koons referred to the work that was sold last month, calling it “the ‘Jim Beam’ work.”
When Christie’s put Koons’s work up for auction, the toy train filled with bourbon sold for $33 million.
Such behavior would lead people to ask: “In a world in which more than six million children die each year because they lack safe drinking water or mosquito nets, or because they have not been immunized against measles, couldn’t you find something better to do with your money?”
At a press conference last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted a justification.
Including them might add as many as 25 million to the number of those who suffered terribly as a result of Stalin’s tyranny.
But communism under Stalin was the opposite of egalitarian, for it gave absolute power to a few, and denied all rights to the many.
America’s Drone Dilemma
In 2006, I wrote about a US missile attack on a house in Damadola, a Pakistani village near the Afghan border, in which 18 people were killed, including five children.
That low number surprised many observers.
Doing so would only lead to the US being seen as an occupying army – a perception that would yield “a torrent of unintended consequences.”
Independence for a small state outside of a political and economic group like the EU would be risky nowadays.
Artur Mas, President of Catalonia’s regional government, has vowed to go ahead with a non-binding referendum anyway.
If other remedies fail in such a situation, secession might be justified as a last resort, even if it imposes heavy costs on the rump state.
Philosophy on Top
What I do know something about, however, is my own discipline, philosophy, which, through its practical side, ethics, makes a vital contribution to the most urgent debates that we can have.
GDI aims to identify “the thinkers and ideas that resonate with the global infosphere as a whole.”
There are the Philosophy Bites podcasts, many blogs, and free online courses, which are attracting tens of thousands of students.
With these words, posted online, Gillian Bennett, an 85-year-old New Zealander living in Canada, began her explanation of her decision to end her life.
In an interview published in 2008 in the Church of Scotland’s magazine Life and Work, she supported the right of those suffering intolerably to end their lives. “If somebody absolutely, desperately wants to die because they’re a burden to their family, or the state,” she argued, “then I think they too should be allowed to die.”
Such a change would remove the anxiety that some patients with progressive dementia have that they will go on too long and miss the opportunity to end their life at all.
Here is one.
Likewise, McDonald’s initial response to criticism of its suppliers’ animal-welfare practices was to sue the activists who made the allegations.
Where land has already been acquired without such consent, and the acquisition is in dispute, Oxfam wants the corporations to insist on fair dispute-resolution procedures.
MELBOURNE – Should your government be able to take away your citizenship?
Nevertheless, Sakr discontinued his appeal, apparently because he was concerned that the use of his cellphone was revealing his location to US intelligence services.
The legislation currently before the UK Parliament does not require any judicial or public proof even of the weaker claim that someone’s presence in the country is not conducive to the public good.
If that were the case with the decisions made by the UK government in 2013, there would still be a high probability that an innocent naturalized citizen was made stateless.
As 60 others scrambled to escape, the human traffickers carrying them to Europe stabbed them and threw them into the sea off the coast of Lampedusa.
For example, tiny Lebanon shelters more than one million of the three million Syrians who are displaced, whereas the EU – 100 times larger – has taken in only about 100,000.
Worse, this portrayal implies that little can be done to mitigate, or even prevent, such occurrences.
This would result in fewer asylum-seekers making life-threatening voyages that leave their families deeply indebted – human traffickers charge as much as €15,000 ($19,700) to cross the Mediterranean – only to be turned away.
This is significant, because Scotland is the strongest base of pro-European sentiment in the UK.
Juncker’s office coldly replied that important portfolios in the new Commission would go to major political figures, and that Juncker “does not owe [Cameron] anything.”
If Cameron’s advisers overestimated the support that they might have received from Merkel and others, they clearly underestimated the power and effectiveness of the European Parliament.
Indeed, it is difficult to see how a re-elected Cameron could maintain the Conservative Party’s unity without endorsing a “no” vote in the referendum on the outcome of his own renegotiation.
The most important finding of the GMF’s Transatlantic Trends survey is that concern about immigrants falls sharply when people are given even the most basic facts.
The average Swede, for example, believes that 18% of the country’s population is composed of migrants; the actual number is close to 13%.
For example, recent research&nbsp;in several countries shows that immigrants as a whole contribute more economically to their communities than they take from them.
Buy Back or Pay Forward?
And yet there is a good reason why the pharmaceutical industry can and should play a major role in financing something like a common “Innovation Fund” to provide financing for early-stage research into solving the problem of antimicrobial resistance.
It is difficult for an outside observer not to draw a connection between the two decisions.
Or, better yet, in a world confronted with a host of problems – from climate change to antimicrobial resistance – industry leaders should begin asking themselves how they can contribute to averting the crises of the future.
In its public pronouncements, the industry denies this by counting just four specific activities as marketing – sales visits to doctors, the value of free samples, direct-to-consumer advertisements, and advertisements in medical journals.
In the six years from 1998 to 2003, of the 487 drugs that entered the market, fully 78% were classified by the US Food and Drug Administration as likely to be no better than drugs already on the market.
They’re just re-jiggering the same old drugs, getting new patents and exclusivity, and relying on their marketing muscle to convince doctors and patients that they’re producing medical miracles.
वास्तव में, औसत रूप से, प्रारंभिक चरण के अनुसंधान में संभावित रूप से उपयोगी के रूप में पहचान किए गए प्रत्येक 10,000 यौगिकों में से केवल एक को ही अंततः नियामकों से मंजूरी प्राप्त होगी। अनुमोदन प्रक्रिया में 15 वर्ष जितना लंबा समय लग सकता है और इसमें सावधानी को वरीयता दी जाती है। यहाँ तक कि जो दवाएँ मानव चिकित्सीय परीक्षणों के लिए अनुमोदित होती हैं, उनमें से पाँच में से केवल एक दवा ही अंतिम बाधा को पार कर पाती है।
इन आँकड़ों को संदर्भ से जोड़ने के लिए, इस पर विचार करें कि यूएस नैशनल इंस्टीट्यूट ऑफ़ हैल्थ बुनियादी चिकित्सा अनुसंधान के क्षेत्र में प्रतिवर्ष $30 बिलियन से कुछ अधिक की निधि लगाती है, और फ़ार्मास्युटिकल रिसर्च एंड मैन्युफ़ैक्चरर्स ऑफ़ अमेरिका के सदस्यों ने अनुसंधान एवं विकास पर पिछले वर्ष लगभग $51 बिलियन की राशि खर्च की थी। मेगाफ़ंड दृष्टिकोण से इन दोनों निवेशों के बीच धन की खाई को पाट देने पर दोनों निवेशों को और अधिक उत्पादक बनाने में मदद मिलेगी।

Despite unequivocal evidence of its positive social and economic impact, education – particularly at the preschool and primary levels – suffers from chronic under-investment.
First, the tax itself is a result of – and, as some may see it, a punishment for – the “bad” financial innovation that brought the global economy to its knees in 2008, hitting the world’s poorest people the hardest.
The type of institution that we have in mind should be a stand-alone organization operating as a registered investment bank and subject to capitalization, regulatory, statutory, and other requirements.
The Disenchantment of Europe
Merkel, together with the European Commission and the European Central Bank, threatened to deprive Greeks of the use of their own currency, the euro, unless their government accepted punitive conditions.
At Merkel’s behest and with the complicity of the ECB, which waited until July 2012 to quell a bond-market panic sparked by eurozone policymakers’ mistakes, the Commission also imposed eurozone-wide austerity, causing a cumulative loss of nearly 10% of GDP in 2011-13, according to the Commission’s own economic model.
In the parliament, a vocal but fragmented minority of critics, cranks, and bigots is likely to push the center-right and center-left groups, which still have a combined majority, to club together even more closely.
In office since February, he won a resounding 41% of the vote, twice that of his nearest rival.
Germany’s Economic Mirage
Written off as the “sick man of Europe” when the euro was launched in 1999, Germany responded not by boosting dynamism, but by cutting costs.
The brunt of the stagnation has been borne by German workers.
Why, then, are businesses unwilling to invest more in the country?
Slashing incomes depresses domestic spending and makes debts even less manageable.
LONDON – After a 16-hour marathon negotiating session ending on March 20, politicians, technocrats, and journalists were all keen to declare the deal on the final piece of Europe’s banking union a success. But appearances are deceptive.
The ECB will directly supervise bigger eurozone banks starting in November (the first step of the banking union), and now it is assessing the strength of their balance sheets.
At Germany’s insistence, the ECB will supervise only the eurozone’s 130 or so biggest banks.
The upshot is that the eurozone as a whole is likely to struggle with a zombie banking system, with only patchy efforts to restructure banks decisively and fairly.
As Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, I have seen firsthand the devastation and heartbreak caused by disasters around the world.
Countries like the Philippines continue to demonstrate the benefits of investing in preparedness, especially when done as part of a larger risk-mitigation effort.
In addition to assisting with emergency relief, it is crucial that the international community help to introduce basic procedures for responding long before disaster strikes.
There is little officials can do about that.
Today, however, about 90% of US breeding sows – the mothers of the pigs that are raised and killed for pork, bacon, and ham – spend most of their lives locked in cages that measure about two feet by seven feet (0.6 meters by 2.2 meters).
Individual stalls for sows, already outlawed in the United Kingdom and Sweden, will be banned across the entire EU from 2013.
Americans seem to care just as much about animal welfare as Europeans do.
In the US, a nation that prides itself on its democratic traditions, pigs and calves are hardly the only losers.
Other judges and official bodies need to keep the pressure on Pinochet.
Pinochet’s ability to evade the courts cast a dark shadow over the country’s military institutions and made many Chileans wonder how far the country had really gone in its transition to democracy.
Powerful supporters defend him, using any underhanded means they can muster.
So it is unsettling that policymakers in many Western economies today resemble the second group of pilots.
Damaging discord has emerged within the troika itself, with a particularly disruptive impasse between Frankfurt, where the ECB resides, and Berlin, the seat of the German government.
Six important issues speak to the problem for policymakers in Europe, the US, and Japan.
Finally, communication has been dreadful.
Each country in every year faces a unique set of circumstances.
African households obtained access to modern medicine much later and more suddenly than people in other regions.
Taken together, African politics, demography, and the delayed arrival of new technologies imposed severe headwinds against per-capita growth of agricultural output in the last quarter of the twentieth century.
But African countries do have some things in common: widespread improvements in farm policy, improved demographic conditions, and the availability of new technologies create new opportunities for the decade ahead.
Abu Bakar Ba’asyir is a radical Muslim cleric who was convicted of blessing the original 2002 Bali bombing, and suspected by some of providing much more.
The proposed bill attracted support from moderate Muslim leaders, but its most vocal advocates were a collection of radical religious groups with a predilection for violence, led by the Islamic Defenders Front (known by its Indonesian acronym, FPI). This year alone, these self-appointed moral vigilantes have ransacked bars and nightclubs, attacked the American and Danish embassies, and stoned the offices of Playboy after its first edition – all with only occasional protests from the police.
A national dialogue about fostering pluralism is now in progress, and has inspired renewed public interest in Pancasila, the national philosophy discredited during the Suharto years but now seen by some as a symbol of Indonesia’s historic pluralism.
If the words of the Olympic Charter, stating that it is a goal of Olympism to “place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity,” are to be fulfilled, it is necessary for all Olympians to be able to learn about the real situation in China and to point out human rights violations freely whenever and wherever in line with their conscience.
Playing Russian Roulette with Climate Change
Decision-makers have not faced up to just how close the world may be to the climate “tipping point.”
In addition, it might be necessary to have a review conference in 2015 to adjust our targets and plans to the new realities.
Who would have imagined in the West ten years ago that the future and their children’s well-being would depend upon decisions taken in Beijing or Delhi or Addis Ababa?
Governments should not withhold the truth from their citizens.
Anglo-Saxon financial institutions are known for their high dividend-payout ratios.
Claims against the personal wealth of shareholders would be blocked by the limited liability constraint.
Such homeowners knew that with rising prices they would be able to realize a gain by either selling their homes or increasing their debt, while in the case of falling prices they could simply hand over the keys to their banks.
The US must carry out fundamental reforms of its financial system to plug the equity leaks and recover investors’ confidence.
हालांकि ये आंकड़े हाल के दशकों में हुई प्रगति को प्रतिबिंबित करते हैं, दुःख की बात तो यह है कि यदि सरकारें लगातार एक समय में केवल एक या दो उपायों पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने के प्रलोभन के आगे झुक नहीं जातीं तो इसमें बहुत अधिक सुधार हो सकता था। इन बीमारियों से होनेवाली बच्चों की मौतों को सदा के लिए समाप्त करने के लिए, सरकारों को चाहिए कि दो साल पहले विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन और यूनिसेफ द्वारा अपनी एकीकृत निमोनिया और डायरिया के लिए वैश्विक कार्य योजना में जिन हस्तक्षेपों की पहचान की गई थी वे उनका पूर्णरूपेण पालन करने के लिए प्रतिबद्धता दर्शाएँ।

In the Polish capital, Catholic and conservative parties, together with the “Solidarity” Trade Union, inspired by a reactionary Christian radio network, “Radio Maria,” gathered for political and cultural, rather than economic, reasons.
And can one blame them, given that Russia seems more nostalgic for its imperial tradition than ever?
It is not so much that its people want to leave the eurozone (or, for that matter, that many want their regions to leave Spain); rather, the country wants to remain itself – that is, to maintain a lifestyle that is largely the product of climate.
Today’s Poles do not believe that Europe has cheated them.
What is specific to Poland is that the past eight years have apparently created a pronounced case of cognitive dissonance. Annual GDP growth averaged 3.2% over this period; and, unlike in the rich West, both inequality and unemployment have actually fallen, with growth mainly benefiting the middle three quintiles of the income distribution.
Tusk praised Poles themselves for their hard work, but neglected to emphasize that without the government’s effective macroeconomic policies, that work would have been wasted. He never even reminded voters that the government’s choices in managing the fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis – which were neither obvious nor easy, because they required rejecting the EU’s austerity consensus – was the right one.
Poland’s New Golden Age
The Berlin Wall would not have fallen when and how it did without Poland’s Solidarność movement and its struggle for freedom and human rights.
Poland has the potential to become a European leader again.
Much of the world seems fascinated by the fact that Poland is now governed by a set of identical twins who first became famous as child movie actors: President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
Among the splinter groups that arose were the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) and the nationalist LPR.
The Kaczynskis want to destroy the “corrupt system composed of careerist politicians, post-communists, former secret service functionaries, and criminal organizations,” who, according to the twins, have ruled Poland since 1989.
To be sure, a political crisis can bring the coalition down, but this can happen only if Poland’s “wandering” electorate decides that the PiS has let it down.
लंदन - वर्तमान एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ, न केवल निमोनिया और मूत्र पथ संक्रमणों जैसी आम बीमारियों से लड़ने में, बल्कि तपेदिक और मलेरिया जैसे कई प्रकार के संक्रमणों का इलाज करने में भी अधिकाधिक निष्प्रभावी होती जा रही हैं, जो अब फिर से लाइलाज होने का जोखिम पैदा कर रहे हैं। जी-7 के नेताओं द्वारा "रोगाणुरोधी प्रतिरोध" (AMR) से निपटने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध होने के हाल ही के संयुक्त प्रस्ताव के साथ, अब अधिक समावेशी जी-20 - और चीन के लिए, जो पहली बार इस समूह की अध्यक्षता कर रहा है - इस लड़ाई को अगले स्तर तक ले जाने की बारी है।
सरकारों को प्रमुख सामाजिक मीडिया अभियान लागू करके इस प्रवृत्ति का लाभ उठाना चाहिए, जिसमें ऐसी चुस्त, निरोगी आदतों को उजागर किया जाए जिन्हें सभी लोगों को अपनाना चाहिए - इन आदतें से परोक्ष रूप से एंटीमाइक्रोबियल्स के लिए मांग कम होगी। ऐसे अभियान की कम लागत और संभावित रूप से मिलनेवाला उच्च लाभ इसे और भी ज़्यादा आकर्षक बना देता है।

At the same time, the information society and globalization have made ours a more insecure world, where we experience risks that politics-as-usual has been unable to address.
But what are these lighthouses? In an information society they will be those who are trusted to be able to help interpret or analyse what is happening.
President George W. Bush projects this style very openly.
Obviously, there is a point where a leader must commit to a decision.
It takes power away from people in their own names, but gives them fear rather than confidence.
Similarly, Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), has taken to governing in a way that is unraveling a decade of progress,&#160;one marked by economic dynamism, rapid growth, and the subordination of the armed forces to civilian control.
Many AKP constituencies are wary of cultural conflict, if only because it threatens their economic interests.
But changes in the judiciary’s composition, Gül’s 2008 accession to the presidency, and a 2010 constitutional amendment allowing military officials to be tried in civilian courts contributed to the gradual loosening of restrictions on Erdoğan’s authority.
Morsi was able to rule without restraint, trampling freely on citizens’ fundamental rights, because the military regime that assumed control after Hosni Mubarak’s 2011 ouster scheduled presidential elections before a constitution was adopted.
Bentham did not rush to publish his work.
Bentham accepts that it may be to the advantage of the community that the law should confer certain rights on people.
Conditioning the Arab Transition
Economic reforms, on the other hand, can wait.
And, as in Egypt, the protracted transition risks faltering under the weight of rising political violence and socioeconomic decline.
The most important task will be to create a new type of political conditionality.
Now, at long last, the West has an opportunity – by providing concrete and generous support for political transition – to bring its values and its interests into alignment.
History abounds with episodes when strategic ambiguity would have been beneficial.
Massive violence against civilian populations is “pacification,” and ethnic cleansing is a “transfer of population.”
The difference is not difficult to discern.
Obama learned this the hard way, when he drew a “red line” against Syria’s use of chemical weapons and then failed to act forcefully when Syria crossed that line.
This is a reality around the world: too many political leaders are ignoring a growing environmental crisis, imperiling their own countries and others.
In California, this winter has been another dry season in a bitter four-year drought, one of the most severe in the region's history.
Almost all studies of human-induced climate change show that the Mediterranean region, including security hotspots like Libya, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, and Syria, is likely to experience a further significant decline in rainfall, compounding the drying trend that has occurred during the past quarter-century.
Many politicians, no doubt, will be grateful for the support of their universities, NGOs, and leading businesses.
Think of the excellent work it has done in the area of competition policy: breaking up cartels and stopping state aid, even when it comes in disguised forms, such as government guarantees on company debt.
The problem is aggravated by the composition of the new Commission.
That law prevents any shareholder who controls more than 20% of voting shares in Volkswagenwerk GmbH (VW) from casting more than 20% of the votes in a shareholders' meeting.
Politics and Corporate Money
To prevent this, lawmakers should adopt safeguards for political spending decisions that would limit the divergence of such decisions from shareholder interests.
Lawmakers also should consider providing public investors with a say over political spending decisions.
The Politics of Economic Stupidity
The malaise afflicting today’s global economy might be best reflected in two simple slogans: “It’s the politics, stupid” and “Demand, demand, demand.”
But even in the US, there are roughly 650,000 fewer public-sector employees than there were before the crisis; normally, we would have expected some two million more.
Meanwhile, in Russia, we can expect Western sanctions to slow growth, with adverse effects on an already weakened Europe.
Demand is what the world needs most.
Unfortunately, spent-fuel storage has been “an afterthought,” as Ernest Moniz, Director of the Energy Initiative at MIT, puts it.
That, in turn, would cause substantial amounts of radioactive material to be released if containment structures are breached, potentially resulting in an area of contamination greater than that caused by the Chernobyl accident in 1986.
Use of plutonium fuels also increases the risk of nuclear-weapons proliferation.
To minimize this risk, casks should be developed that can easily be transferred to a secure interim storage facility while permanent repositories receive approval.
In his pre-Christmas speech to the Roman Curia, the pope did not mention rape, let alone the sexual murder in Delhi.
Marriage is a way to contain our dangerous desires.
The men were not uneducated, but they were unable to cope with the freedoms of contemporary women.
But the more sex is repressed and people are made to fear it the greater the chance of sexual violence, because anyone who might possibly stir our sexual desires, man or woman, becomes a potential target of our rage.
He asked her if she wanted to leave seven orphans.
First, leaving aside the “ideological" question of whether family planning is a right, there is overwhelming evidence to show that a lack of access to contraception is bad for women's health.
Moreover, an overwhelming majority of scientists in the relevant fields believe that we are on track to exceed the level of global warming at which feedback mechanisms will kick in and climate change will become uncontrollable, with unpredictable and possibly catastrophic consequences.
Who could oppose such an obvious win-win proposition? The only naysayers, we may suspect, are those in the grip of a religious ideology that they seek to impose on others, no matter what the consequences for women, children, and the rest of the world, now and for centuries to come.
Laudatio Si has received considerable media attention, most of it focused on its uncompromising call for action on climate change.
Our “dominion” over the universe, he declares, should be understood “in the sense of responsible stewardship.”
Although animal advocates implored Ratzinger to reiterate his views on animal welfare after he became Pope, he never did so.
Mengikuti seruan Paus Fransiskus untuk mengambil tindakan bukan hanya isu moral; tapi merupakan isu praktis.
Hutan dimana masyarakat adat tinggal seringkali menyimpan karbon dalam jumlah lebih besar dibandingkan dengan hutan yang dikelola oleh pemilik lain, baik pemerintah atau swasta.
A Papal Education
In Zambia and Mali, for example, only two children in ten can read after two years in school; in Afghanistan and South Sudan, only three adult women in ten can read.
In the US, a comprehensive review of more than 3,000 studies found that low adult reading skills were directly related to higher rates of morbidity and worse health.
LONDON – It’s a dollar to a cent that Pope Francis’s visit to the United States in September will be one of the biggest news stories of 2015.
He embodies the message, delivered in the Gospel of St. Matthew’s account of the Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness” (Matthew 5:6).
Nonetheless, in parts of the American political establishment, Israel – specifically, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his Likud Party – can do no wrong.
In 1891, Pope Leo XIII produced Rerum Novarum, an encyclical on workers’ rights that fundamentally challenged the contemporary political discourse and approach to policymaking.
The chief Jesuit confessor at the papal court used to be called “the black pope,” owing to his simple black cassock (if not his sinister intent).
At the same time, Francis has launched a series of initiatives aimed at pleasing just about everyone.
This is not a new situation.
He can scold – a tack that Francis has so far tried to avoid – but he cannot convince.
One could argue that concessions on this front would simply acknowledge attitudinal and behavioral reality and allow the church to move on.
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, despite concerted efforts at eradication and crop substitution, Afghanistan produced 87% of the world’s opium in 2005 – roughly 4.1 tons – generating $2.7 billion of illegal revenue, which amounts to roughly 52% of the country’s GDP.
The result of this was laid out in a report by the European Union’s Election Observation Mission that I presented in Kabul last December: Afghanistan risks becoming a “rentier” state with easy access to resources that lubricate corruption throughout its entire political system, finance illegal armed groups, and fuel regional destabilization.
It would also provide Afghan peasants, who have been growing poppy despite forced eradication of the plant and incentives to change crops, with an option that is regulated by law and that, in time, could have an impact on the heroin trade.
Paradoxically, the EU – seen as a guarantee of stability and progress – is itself part of the problem.
Tomas G. Masaryk, Czechoslovakia’s first president after its establishment in 1918, used to say that his country was a democracy, but “so far, without democrats.”
Viktor Orban’s Fidesz party, which could win Hungary’s elections next spring, provides a particularly instructive example.
To understand why, it is helpful to take a broad view of Latin America’s history and economic development.
Democracy in Latin America has been a hard-won struggle.
In Peru, for example, Alejandro Toledo is that country’s first indigenous president.
Measuring the Next Global Development Goals
The task amounts to this generation’s greatest opportunity to translate high aspirations into concrete targets.
There is no shortage of information available online about the number of poor people in almost any country in any year since 1990; but much of it is based on sketchy data.
In 2013, a high-level panel of politicians and civil-society and private-sector leaders advocated the creation of “better data-collection systems, especially in developing countries.”
Given capacity constraints, particularly in the poor countries, this cost is likely to be high.
Post-American Israel
The next US president, whether he is Barack Obama or John McCain, will certainly maintain the close bilateral alliance.
In their effort to achieve international respect and legitimacy as responsible stakeholders in today’s evolving international system, countries such as China, India, and even Russia have a greater interest in stability than in global confusion.
Traditional bodies such as the Organization of American States and the Andean Community of Nations – in which US influence is a defining feature – have weakened, making way for Chávez’s Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).
In other areas, diplomacy would be quieter and less ideological with Capriles as president, but it would be no less ambitious.
For example, Ecuador, under a Chávez-allied government led by President Rafael Correa, has not adopted Venezuela’s openly confrontational model of relations with the US.
Some argue that these countries are inherently unstable. Their political cultures are underdeveloped.
As a result, their historic mission doomed them.
Polish Prime Minister Lezsek Miller resigned one day after his country's official admission to the EU.
Post-National Football?
The fans of national sides are actors in a kind of patriotic carnival, dressed in the costumes of their national stereotypes: English fans as medieval knights, the Dutch in clogs, the Spanish as bullfighters.
In fact, the reality of football styles is rather more complicated.
They are, to use his phrase, “mercenaries.”
The best European clubs are all multinational now.
Uribe’s absence has opened the election in unforeseen ways.
Both have ingeniously mobilized young people and made innovative use of online social networks.
Obviously the FARC guerrillas – much diminished by Uribe, but still violently opposed to Colombian democracy – remain a source of concern for many Colombians.
PARIS – In normal life, technicalities are better left to technicians.
Similarly, a credit-fueled construction boom drives output above potential, resulting in inflation.
The European Union has an additional problem: in response to the sovereign crisis, most of its members agreed in 2011 to a “fiscal compact” requiring them to keep their structural budget deficit – the one they would record were output equal to potential – below 0.5% of GDP.

But relentless attempts at accuracy easily result in noise.
A greater degree of stability in the assessment of an economy’s potential would strengthen decision-makers’ awareness and appreciation of longer-term challenges, thereby putting policymaking on a sounder footing.
At-home positions, frequently filled by women, are also on the rise.
The estimated 330 million working women who lived below the poverty line in 2008-2009 accounted for roughly 60% of the 550 million working poor worldwide.
Although all countries offer some kind of social protection or security, in most countries, coverage is severely limited and targeted at specific groups.
Half of the world’s population uses solid fuel, such as wood, charcoal, or dung, for cooking.
The financial implications of ensuring universal energy access are large, but not overwhelming when weighed against the enormous benefits.
We need a firm commitment from all sides: private businesses, academia, civil society, and international organizations and NGOs.
विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन (डब्ल्यूएचओ) ने इस महामारी से निबटने में अंतर्राष्ट्रीय मदद जुटाने में केंद्रीय भूमिका निभाई है. इसमें राष्ट्रीय सरकारों तथा डॉक्टर्स विदआउट बॉर्डर्स और अमेरिकी रोग नियंत्रण एवं रोकथाम केंद्रों ने भी अहम योगदान दिया. महामारी अभी भी फैल रही है. जन-स्वास्थ्य समुदाय इससे निपटने के लिए गंभीर प्रयास कर रहा है. क्लिनिक कर्मियों, महामारी विशेषज्ञों तथा अन्य विशेषज्ञों की तैनाती के लिए 10 करोड़ डॉलर कोष का इस्तेमाल किया जा रहा है.
बरसात का मौसम निकट आ रहा है. इस मौसम में तरह-तरह की महामारियों के फैलने का खतरा बढ़ जाता है. इससे स्वास्थ्य-सेवा प्रणालियों की क्षमताओं पर जोर पड़ता है. तब इस बात की जरूरत बढ़ जाती है कि नागरिकों को इन महामारियों से निबटने के लिए प्रेरित किया जाए, प्रशिक्षित और न्यूनतम् सुविधाओं से सुसज्जित किया जाए. इस कार्य के लिए लक्षित विकास सहायता, घरेलू निवेश, विशेषज्ञ सहायता जैसे मिलेजुले प्रयासों के अलावा उप-सहारा देशों से जमीनी-स्तर का परिप्रेक्ष्य भी चाहिए जिन्होंने अपने समुदाय स्वास्थ्यकर्मियों के नेटवर्कों को सफलतापूर्वक ऊपर उठाया है.


अंत में, स्वास्थ्य सेवा की नई दुनिया में असीमित संभावना है क्योंकि इसकी सरहद उस स्थान को छूती है जहां हम रहते हैं और खेलते हैं. यह हम सभी को स्वास्थ्य सेवा विशेषज्ञ और अविष्कारक बनाती है. आखिरकार, किसी चिर रोग के खिलाफ लड़ाई घर में ही जीती या हारी जाएगी.
What is wrong with the precautionary principle? It appears to be a statement of the obvious: unacceptable disasters require extraordinary counter-measures.
There is no escape from balancing costs and benefits. There is no way we can avoid making difficult choices.
During the last 200 years, a period when we have had accurate measurements from tide gauges, the sea level has continued to rise slowly.
It would be unfortunate if China and India were to impoverish themselves by ceasing to burn coal, only to have the resulting decrease of snowfall over Greenland and Antarctica cause sea levels to rise faster.
Public security is a pre-requisite for freedom, and protecting freedom is at the core of a democratic state’s responsibility for public security.
In Germany, radicalization takes place largely through radical mosque communities or private prayer rooms, as well as through the Internet.
Our societies need to engender greater respect and acknowledgement of others, and to acquire more knowledge about different cultures and religions.
We need Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Maghreb countries as partners in the fight against Islamist terrorism, and that means improved operational cooperation between security authorities.
Even as the deal was announced, however, newspaper reports suggested that officials recognized that the measures would be insufficient to meet the target; further negotiations on additional steps would be needed at a politically more convenient moment.
Applying it in Greece would be a highly visible test; if successful, it would set a valuable precedent.
In September 2010, four months after the official Greek bailout was put in place, the IMF issued a pamphlet asserting that “default in today’s advanced economies is unnecessary, undesirable, and unlikely.”
The most reasonable comparison is with Latin American countries during their debt crises in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
Several proponents of these new ideas have openly used the analogy with drugs.
It is impossible to anticipate the numerous financial products that human ingenuity can create, and that can be dangerous to use but of great value to some.
In order to keep the system lean, there should be a provision for exempting some individuals and firms – those sophisticated enough to handle their own affairs, or well off enough to deal with financial failure – from the requirement of an RFP’s approval before buying a prescription financial product.
Now it is back in fashion in Washington.
Will Bush’s new approach succeed? On a recent trip to Europe, I encountered both encouragement and skepticism.
Even with these increases, there is a long way to go to improve America’s standing.
Nonetheless, the elections may have softened some of the sense of illegitimacy that has clouded Bush’s Iraq policy.
Egregious cases in the last century include the Holocaust in Nazi Germany, the Khmer Rouge killing fields in Cambodia, and the genocide in Rwanda.
But some other multiethnic societies such as Tanzania and Burkina Faso have largely escaped communal conflict.
While none of these groups represents a majority point of view, they do exert significant influence and probably believe that they are acting in the interest of the majority.
Democratic governments are often perceived as more respectful of minorities, given that, unlike autocratic regimes, a democratic system with an elected legislature, independent judicial system, strong civil society, and free press provides citizens with opportunities to express their views and pursue justice.
We have the knowledge to secure our future by improving the life prospects of all our young children.
Neuroscience and the biology of stress help us to begin to understand how poverty and other adversities are literally built into our bodies.
The scientific principles of early childhood development do not vary by family income, program type, or funding source.
Preventive Diplomacy, Not Pre-Emptive Strikes
The devastation in Lebanon will take generations to repair, not only materially, but also psychologically.
As well as taking collective action to stop the war in Lebanon and Gaza, key players like the “quartet” – the UN, the United States, the European Union, and Russia – must develop a comprehensive security framework for the Middle East.
Causing loss of lives does not contribute to the present or future welfare of the people of the region.
The Socialist International is committed to working hard with its partners in the region to make peace in the Middle East a reality.
Over the past 33 years, I have had plenty of opportunity to study both oil prices and foreign exchange rates, including overseeing a research department of talented people trying to predict their movements.
In 2011, after both prices had recovered from the collapse induced by the 2008 credit crisis, the five-year price started to come down gradually, while the spot price continued to surge for a while.
They may very well get their wish.
During the 1990’s, holding shares of firms with no or few entrenching provisions, and shorting shares of firms with many such provisions, would have outperformed the market.
We found evidence that, by 2001, markets learned to appreciate the difference between good-governance and bad-governance firms in terms of their expected future profitability.
Lowering entrenchment levels, rather than trading on them, continues to offer opportunities for substantial returns to firms’ shareholders.
On this day, daughters, wives, and girlfriends give presents to Russian men and lavish them with attention.
According to FOM, 51% of Russians support abolishing conscription, and 67% are against extending the age of eligibility for the draft.
Obligatory military service is inefficient, because “free” conscript labor is much cheaper for the Russian military than hiring civilians as, for example, cooks and cleaning personnel.

एकीकृत दृष्टिकोण का विकास करने के लिए दुनिया के नेताओं के पास तीन महत्वपूर्ण अवसर होंगे। जुलाई में, संयुक्त राष्ट्र अदीस अबाबा, इथियोपिया में विकास के लिए वित्त-पोषण पर सम्मेलन आयोजित करेगा। सितंबर में, संयुक्त राष्ट्र महासभा स्थायी विकास लक्ष्यों (एसडीजी) को प्रारंभ करने के लिए कार्यक्रम आयोजित करेगी। और दिसंबर में, दुनिया भर के नेता जलवायु परिवर्तन पर संयुक्त राष्ट्र फ़्रेमवर्क समझौते के प���्षों के 21वें सम्मेलन (सीओपी 21) में भाग लेंगे, जहाँ उनके ग्रीनहाउस गैस उत्सर्जनों की दीर्घावधि कमी पर बाध्यकारी वैश्विक समझौते को स्वीकार करने की आशा है।
विकास परियोजनाओं का वित्त-पोषण करने के लिए पर्याप्त पूँजी आकर्षित करने के लिए दुर्लभ आधिकारिक सहायता का लाभ उठाने के लिए, बहुपक्षीय विकास बैंक (एमडीबी) पहले ही अलग-अलग और सामूहिक रूप से मदद कर रहे हैं। वास्तव में, उनका वित्तीय लाभ उनके ढाँचे में निर्मित है: वे मौलिक रूप से वित्तीय संस्थाएँ हैं, जिन्हें कुशलता से प्रदत्त पूँजी की छोटी राशियों से वित्त-पोषित किया गया है जो शेयरधारकों द्वारा प्रतिदेय पूँजी से समर्थित हैं।
Africa’s development challenges are well known.
The rebirth of Africa’s private sector – a critical missing ingredient in past development efforts – has played a significant role in driving this performance, and it can fill the investment gap while generating returns in the process.
But taking advantage of this opportunity requires a new approach to private financing of Africa’s development, in which Africa is the lead investor in its own economic renaissance.
Indeed, without profound structural change, the favorable standard of living that underpins the Gulf states’ political stability is likely to erode.
Wealthy locals, for example, could be given incentives to invest in start-ups, while the government could provide low-interest loans and defer repayment until a particular profit threshold is reached.
International institutions could help by offering technical assistance.
The fundamental problem with the patent system is simple: it is based on restricting the use of knowledge.
But the cost to society was enormous: the high price that Myriad, the patent holder, places on genetic tests (between $3,000 and $4,000) may well mean that thousands of women who would otherwise have been tested, discovered that they were at risk, and taken appropriate remediation, will die instead.
A prize fund would work well in areas in which needs are well known – the case for many diseases afflicting the poor – allowing clear goals to be set in advance.
But the real worry is not the risk associated with near-term challenges, like Japan’s return to recession in 2014 or the eurozone’s enduring sluggishness; it is the gale-force headwinds that the entire world will face over the next half-century.
But, as fertility declines and populations age, the labor engine’s contribution to growth will fall sharply, to little more than 0.3 percentage points of annual growth.
These changes, while important, would have a limited impact, lifting labor’s contribution to future growth from one-fifth to only one-third of post-war levels.
Because the biggest opportunities lie in spurring faster productivity catch-up by adopting and diffusing today’s best practices, politicians must keep pushing to reduce trade and regulatory barriers to market integration and competition.
This was down from 1% in 1996-2006 and 0.5% in the crisis years of 2007-2012.
One view, popular among economic historians, is that it takes time for the productivity-enhancing effects of new technologies to show up.
Employment of prime-age males should be rising, not falling.
They are delivering less patient care as they spend more time hunched over their laptops, inputting data that add nothing, currently, to their productivity.
The theoretical debate could continue indefinitely.
After all, a short-sighted approach not only undermines companies’ prospects; it also threatens the entire economy.
In doing so, such companies offer a powerful response to the question of what their role in society should be. More important, they are showing the rest of the corporate sector that the business of advancing the common good is a worthy one.
Despite the demonstrated benefits of broad-based profit-sharing programs, only about one-third of US private-sector workers participate in them, and about 20% own stock in their companies.
Promisingly, the United Automobile Workers union recently announced that, as it continues to push for collective bargaining rights, it is also cooperating with management to form a works council in the German-owned Volkswagen plant in Tennessee.
Spurred partly by this tax incentive, corporations have shifted top executives’ compensation toward shares, options, and other forms of profit sharing and stock ownership, largely leaving out regular workers.
NEW YORK – In theory, it is hard to think of any nobler computer service than the typical “Help Wanted” board.
To my surprise, there are about 100,000 certified life coaches in the United States these days.
I asked her: “Is it just me, or do juries really rise to the challenge?” She replied: “Only twice in my career have I disagreed with the verdict of my jury.”
Do they try harder under pressure, or do they quit in the face of difficulty?
It remains unclear how effective this will be, but I’m betting on it.
The fiscal and economic arguments for a more liberal approach to migration have shaped the American debate.
One million people relocated to Germany in 2012 alone.
Other countries have also gotten on the reform bandwagon.
The first such summit, in 2006, gave birth to an important new institution, the Global Forum on Migration and Development.
There is no shortage of problems to confront and opportunities to seize.
This progress is all the more important given the complacency that led to a complete standstill in research and development for new TB interventions toward the end of the twentieth century.
The bad news is that infected individuals carry the agent with them for their entire lives.
While this additional cost can be borne by health-care systems in the rich world, it is excessive for poor countries, implying no, or insufficient, treatment.
We still have a long way to go, and accelerated R&D to develop new drugs and vaccines can be achieved only with increased funding.
Sustainable Development Economics
After all, most politicians love to spend money they don’t have.
Unless the public sector invests, and invests wisely, the private sector will continue to hoard its funds or return them to shareholders in the forms of dividends or buybacks.
Business investment without infrastructure and human capital cannot be profitable.
Free-market ideologues claim that governments are incapable of productive investment.
The US has no such institution, or indeed any agency that looks systematically at public-investment strategies.
This enthusiasm for reform marks a paradigm shift.
Support should be raised tenfold or even more to make a real impact.
Working with moderate Arab states, we can create a new regional security regime for the Greater Middle East, modeled on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
In Europe, the Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs and the High Representative on External Affairs are boosting Europe's ability to tackle new threats.
Big losses for large depositors in Cypriot banks will now be imposed, and the country’s second-largest bank will be shuttered.
In fact, in the search for an acceptable bailout package, the future revenues from these assets were at one point considered as possible guarantees.
Anastasiades, a member of the pro-European Dimokratikós Sinayermós (Democratic Rally) party, won 57% of the popular vote on a platform that emphasized economic recovery, and this will naturally be his top priority.
And the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Öcalan’s recent call for a ceasefire is an encouraging sign that Turkey, too, stands to benefit from a peace dividend.
Namun dalam beberapa dekade saja, seperempat jenis hiu dan pari terancam punah.
Timbul persoalan buruk lainnya di luar ZEE: sebagian besar sumber daya hayati secara de facto bersifat terbuka sehingga menjadikan mereka rentan terhadap eksploitasi berlebihan.
Satu langkah yang memberi harapan, hasil rekomendasi kelompok kerja di PBB pada bulan Januari, adalah perumusan perjanjian baru yang mengikat secara hukum tentang keanekaragaman hayati di laut lepas yang saat ini tengah dipersiapkan untuk tinjauan di hadapan Majelis Umum PBB pada bulan September yang akan datang.
Perjanjian berikutnya mengenai “keanekaragaman hayati di luar wilayah jurisdiksi nasional”, yang didasarkan pada cara-cara terbaru untuk memantau kepatuhan, dapat meningkatkan pengelolaan laut dengan pesat.
The war has claimed more than 200,000 lives and devastated Syria’s social and economic fabric.
A comprehensive resolution of the conflict is urgently needed.
This not only flies in the face of morality; it is also counterproductive.
Taking Safety Littorally
The list goes on.
In Hilo, Hawaii, after devastating tsunamis struck in 1946, 1960, and 1964, the vulnerable area near the city was declared a municipal park, where no structures were allowed to be built.
In order to protect the local economy further, beaches should be repaired after major storms through “beach nourishment” (replacement of lost sand from external sources).
In addition, construction in coastal areas damaged by extreme events could be prohibited, as has been done in Hilo, Hawaii.
When it is absent or deficient, the loss of life and livelihoods can be horrific – witness Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged Haiti and New Orleans in 2005.
Redundancy is the key.&#160;
Admittedly, the impact of natural disasters is less systemic; but if a calamity takes out key components of networks that lack redundancy and backup, the effects are similar.
Another line of reasoning is that businesses that depend heavily on continuity – for example, hospitals, outsourcing firms in India, and stock exchanges – will invest in their own backup systems.
Hubs that lack resilience create cascades of collateral damage when they fail.
In the case of Zimbabwe, it is extremely difficult to obtain such information.
Once again, the African Union, with the support of the UN, should provide the leadership that would demonstrate that Africa has the capacity and the will to resolve a great crisis in a manner that mitigates the suffering of African people.
It continued last year when the Bush administration, recognizing that it had no policies to boost employment, explored whether China's undervalued exchange rate might be blamed for closed factories in Ohio.
The fall over the past three years in the proportion of the working-age population with jobs in America has been the biggest in percentage terms since the Great Depression.
The 21st century will see the world constantly at war against terrorism.
As it happened, we wiped the floor with them, winning by an unprecedented margin of 80% to 20%.
This claim has great credibility with labor unions that believe that trade with poor countries produces paupers in rich countries.
Even if other economies are closed, open economies still profit from their own free trade.
This scare arose during Senator John Kerry’s failed presidential campaign in 2004, when digitized x-rays were sent from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston to be read in India.
The court accepted that the government may require factually accurate health warnings, but the majority, in a split decision, said that it could not go as far as requiring images.
Cigarettes are also highly addictive.
Mill could have accepted requirements for health warnings on cigarette packs, and even graphic photos of diseased lungs if that helps people to understand the choice that they are making; but he would have rejected a ban.
MILAN – The world is facing the prospect of an extended period of weak economic growth.
Though the US is finally emerging from an extended period in which potential output exceeded demand, high unemployment continues to suppress demand in Europe.
The notable exception is China, which has maintained high (and occasionally perhaps excessive) levels of public investment throughout the post-crisis period.
At the same time, this approach means that policymakers must find ways to ensure that public investments provide returns for private investors.
President Barack Obama relied on that power when he told both Congress and the American people that he had the authority to order limited strikes on Syria without going to Congress.
Moreover, diplomacy thrives on back-room deals of the kind that US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have just struck over Syria’s chemical weapons.
These arguments do not mean that leaders will not use force from time to time without turning to their people first. Obama does have constitutional authority to conduct limited military strikes to deter and degrade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s ability to use chemical weapons.
Most of the pain is deferred, which is precisely why such cuts are politically attractive.
For example, in the face of investor pressure, pharmaceutical companies have cut their research activities dramatically, relying instead on acquisition strategies.
If public and private investment decisions are driven only by the easily measured and easily defined, we will miss out on the breakthrough moments that characterize so much of human achievement and advancement.
But effective programs require more than just money; they need employers and educators who can identify the necessary skills, create the structures to teach them, and match trained workers with available jobs.
For every dollar a student pays or gives up to attend school, his or her future income rises by about $4.80.
That program is now operating at 163 colleges and institutes.
AT&amp;T offers scholarships through partner non-profit institutions and provides paid internships for up to 100 graduates.
वाशिंग्टन, डी सी - वैश्विक असमानता में भारी वृद्धि और आय वितरण के एकदम शीर्ष पर धन के संकेंद्रण को संचालित करने वाले कारकों में से एक कारक नवाचार और वैश्विक बाज़ारों के बीच पारस्परिक प्रभाव है। सक्षम उद्यमी के हाथों में प्रौद्योगिकी सफलता अरबों डॉलर के बराबर हो सकती है, जिसका कारण विनियामक संरक्षण और वैश्विक बाज़ारों की, विजेता-सब-कुछ-ले-जाए की प्रकृति होना है। तथापि, जिस बात की अकसर अनदेखी की जाती है, वह जनता के पैसे द्वारा निजी धन के इस आधुनिक संकेंद्रण में निभाई जाने वाली भूमिका है।
इसमें कोई संदेह नहीं है कि निजी उद्यमियों की कल्पना, मार्केटिंग की जानकारी, और प्रबंधन कौशल नई प्रौद्योगिकी को सफल रूप में लागू किए जाने के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं। और अनेक नवाचारों के वाणिज्यीकरण द्वारा पेश की जाने वाली कम क़ीमतें, बेहतर उत्पाद, और उपभोक्ता की बचत स्पष्ट रूप से बड़े सामाजिक लाभ प्रदान करते हैं। लेकिन हमें इन सफलताओं में सरकार की भूमिका को नज़रअंदाज़ नहीं करना चाहिए।
बहुत अधिक प्रतिभा को जुटाने के लिए भारी मात्रा में प्रतिलाभ की ज़रूरत नहीं होती; ख़ास तौर से अच्छी उद्यमशीलता के लिए कुछ सालों तक 50% लाभ जैसा मार्जिन स्वीकार्य लाभ होगा। तथापि, उस राशि का कई गुना बस कुछ व्यक्तियों को जनता द्वारा दिए गए तोहफ़े जैसा बनकर रह जाता है। ऐसे उपायों और अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समझौतों के संयोजन जैसा कोई उपाय ढूँढ़ा जा सकता है जिससे करदाताओं को, जानकार उद्यमियों के लिए अभिनव उत्पादों को वाणिज्यिक बनाने के प्रोत्साहनों को हटाए बिना, अपने निवेश पर अच्छे प्रतिलाभ मिल सकते हों।
But, as requirements for registering clinical trials have become more stringent, its magnitude has become quantifiable: the results of at least half of the clinical trials involving patients and healthy volunteers remain unpublished years after completion.
It is widely acknowledged that the high current level of investment in pharmaceutical research is yielding too few substantive discoveries.
Publication is a moral imperative.
Then, crisis erupted in May, when the country ran low on foreign-currency reserves and traders could not purchase the dollars they needed.

The IMF should not be in the ransom business.
The resulting fiscal austerity plunged many below the poverty line and accelerated economic inequality, while many private institutions, having caused the 2008 bust, recovered on the public dime.
The refusal of today’s elites to promote an effective balance of the three powers – to recognize a larger purpose beyond maximizing each individual power – has visibly translated into a waning regard for the public good.
The push toward such a space needs to be spearheaded by risk takers – social and political entrepreneurs who are unafraid to work across lines traditionally dividing sectors and states, and who help to re-create a global community of purpose beyond power.
After twelve years of transition, the answer to the first question has blurred.
Autocracy, not dictatorship.
Welcome to the republic.
The emergence of viable political parties requires a strong parliament.
The reformist "Union of Right Forces," led by Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais, destroyed itself last December, failing to gain a seat in the Duma.
But the French have an older word for Putinism: étatisme , which holds that the state commands society rather than serves it.
Will Russia have to rewrite its laws and Constitution to give the prime minister more official power? Is Putin risking his political future by accepting a formally secondary role and making himself accountable for all socio-economic policy?
Many commentators underestimate the prime minister’s powers.
While not entirely addressing the flaws in the design, the new situation – with the strongest political figure heading the executive branch – will permit more effective performance by the government, which is still battling to recover from Putin’s administrative reforms of 2004.
Mikhail Kasyanov, a former prime minister and now an opposition critic, was inherited from Yeltsin.
The bloodshed in France, however, has changed the calculus completely, pointing toward the possibility of a rapprochement between Russia and the West.
The West has “lied to us many times, made decisions behind our backs, placed before us a fait accompli,” Putin said in a televised address, shortly after a dubious referendum in Crimea cemented Russia’s control over the region.
Russia has achieved its objective in Ukraine: a frozen conflict that will provide the Kremlin a continuous role in the country’s politics.
Russia’s participation in the battle against the Islamic State – and its return to the rule-abiding ranks of the international community – may be worth the price.
As a result, whereas Hungary pays Gazprom $260 per thousand cubic meters of gas, Poland pays $526 – the highest price in the EU.
In essence, the decision sent the same message as the EU’s anti-trust action against Gazprom: rules apply to everyone, and stolen property must be returned.
Putin Made Simple
Multiple higher courts were too difficult to maintain, so a single court replaced them.
The destruction of democratic institutions was now being driven both by the desire for simplicity and by pure greed.
Unfortunately, such a scenario seems farfetched.
But the plain truth is that neither the BRICS nor the SCO is remotely close to being a cohesive bloc capable of insulating Russia from the consequences of its behavior in Ukraine.
That, in a nutshell, was the Soviet model, which failed once and would fail again.
On the other hand, with the help of the military-industrial KGB complex – the “ siloviki ” – he has systematically weakened or destroyed every check on his personal power, while strengthening the state’s ability to violate citizens’ constitutional rights.
Like their president, most Russians see no contradiction between improving their personal lives and the country’s international status since the 1990’s and the erosion of democratic institutions.
What could be more democratic?
Like other democratic leaders, he might consider working in the private-sector, like Gerhard Schröder, or, better yet, write books and help Tsunami victims, like Bill Clinton or become an environmentalist, like Mikhail Gorbachev.
Back then, the US encouraged Islam as a bulwark against communism.
Russia’s other aim has been to exempt from UN sanctions the Bushehr nuclear reactor that it has been building for Iran.
A nuclear-armed Iran on its doorstep is certainly not in Russia’s national interest, particularly given the increasing radicalization of Russia’s own 20 million Muslim citizens – the only part of its population that is actually growing.
For starters, it is based on the claim that, at the time of the Berlin Wall’s collapse and the Soviet Union’s disintegration, the West promised that there would be no NATO expansion. Even Mikhail Gorbachev, on the 25th anniversary of the Wall’s demise, accused the West of not keeping the promises it made in 1989, instead taking “advantage of Russia’s weakening” in the 1990s to claim “monopoly leadership and domination of the world,” including through NATO enlargement.
The next year, the financial crisis struck, convincing Putin that his assessment had been prophetic. The crisis, in his view, was proof that the days of American global dominance were over.
While Western politicians and economic policymakers were trying to avert Great Depression II, Putin was already working on the assumption that it had arrived. For the West, managing the resulting geopolitical imbroglio will be even more challenging than repairing its damaged economies.
The regime and the public now see the current situation as more or less normal – a “non-crisis crisis.”
The consequence is a country divided between loyal and disloyal, patriotic and unpatriotic – that is, between those who toe the party line and those who refuse.
The stagnation will probably last into the following political cycle, too.
This recalls the American political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski’s observation in the 1950s that totalitarian regimes (in contrast to authoritarian ones) impose both prohibitions and imperatives on citizens.
Perhaps most blatant, the Russian state under Putin compels citizens’ political mobilization, by interpreting non-participation as resistance to the regime. In this context, Hirschman’s “exit” option – at least in the form of “inner emigration” – may not be as readily available as it might seem; it would, after all, be easy to construe such a move as resistance.
The restaurant had many of the traits found in ethnic restaurants everywhere.
The White Sun existed in Soviet times.
But the main attraction is a shooting gallery where patrons can test their skills between courses.
As a special honor, his Russian hosts organized an excursion to Strelna, the “Russian Versailles,” which was recently restored from ruin to become the Petersburg residence of President Vladimir Putin.
Like the customers in that Ukrainian-style village restaurant, perhaps Putin found his attic ark reassuring in some unconscious way.
The contrast with its benign policy toward Libya in 2011 reflects how Russian foreign policy changed with the return of Vladimir Putin to the Kremlin.
If Russia were serious about economic integration, it would promote free-trade agreements to facilitate trade in all directions.
In early 2009, when Gazprom could not sell all of its gas to Europe because of the Great Recession, it sought to cut its supplies from Central Asia.
On his way to the Crimea, however, Putin encountered a notorious Russian nationalist motorcycle gang, whose members demand that the Crimea be transferred to Russia.
The CSTO remains a paper alliance without military significance.
Unlike the fracas over an American missile shield in Europe, this conflict shows no signs of blowing over, and threatens to damage further the rocky relationship between Russia and the West.    
Now, at the eleventh hour, Russia is sticking to its obstructionist position, and its presidential election in March will likely reinforce anti-Western postures.
A declaration of independence by Kosovo will likely bring a similar declaration from Georgia’s breakaway Abkhazia region, which Russia could well recognize.
In the case of Abkhazia, the West should reiterate the sui generis nature of Kosovo and highlight the tremendous efforts it has undertaken there since 1999.
But that continuity is more reminiscent of the zastoi, or stagnation, of the Brezhnev era.
Instead, the state is the target of political entrepreneurs who strive to capture it in order to capture the rents that it controls.
As a proportion of GDP, it has been halved since the early 1990’s, and is now just 1% of GDP.
“meaningful reforms look highly unlikely – for the simple reason that they would harm the interests of Russia’s ruling elites.
Instead, the Russian people have now challenged the status quo.
Such a change would be doubly beneficial: it would both enhance trade and hold to account people responsible for egregious human-rights abuses.
Imposing travel sanctions on suspected human-rights abusers is a sensible and practical way forward.
For example, Putin recently abolished elections in Russia’s provinces.
Their national independence is now more elusive than it was before the terrorist era began.
Their common interest is continuation of the game.
Call this the “Asef” effect.
Abolishing democracy in Russia’s provinces, including Muslim-populated regions such as Tatarstan and Dagestan, is a deadly act.
In 1991, the Soviet Union –&nbsp;then seemingly an unbreakable monolith – collapsed in just a few months.
History debunks Putin’s myth that the majority of the country supports him because they want “stability,” and that the protests, headed by “Western stooges,” are about to subside.
Their personal interests, and riches, are too dependent on maintaining the status quo.
When he left the Kremlin in 2000, his secret fortune, from real estate, yachts, horses, and other properties, was estimated to be worth at least $15 million.
Second, Putin cannot stand Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who admittedly is not an easy man to like.
Where is NATO’s front line?
But you can forget about seeing that.
Yet it looks suspiciously as though the deal that ended the fighting will leave Russian troops in that truncated country for years.
Europe's approach is weak and will cause bigger problems in the future. So Putin wins the gold medal in his favorite event - bullying his smaller neighbors.
They also see this victory as the main counter-weight to the memory of the USSR as a reign of brutal, unjustified violence.
Instead, he includes all citizens of the USSR who died during the war, including millions of Ukrainians, Belarusians, and others.
Molotov, who remained in power throughout the war and until 1956, denied the existence of the Secret Protocols until his death 30 years later.
No price is too high to achieve that end, so traditional threats about dividing Ukraine have been used.
Arm some of these manufactured minority structures so that they can demand autonomy at the barrel of a gun, and you get the kind of chaos the Kremlin can use to reassert its control.
Proximity to this lawless territory has helped make Moldova the poorest land in Europe.
The first step is to make Russia honor its binding commitment to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, as well as to the Council of Europe, to remove its troops from Moldova and Georgia.
Moreover, Putin’s Kremlin has used the West –&nbsp;eager for engagement and a policy “reset” with Russia – to legitimize its authoritarian rule and to provide opportunities for its venal cronies’ integration into Western society.
In this way, Putin’s regime intensifies political dissenters’ longing for retaliation – thereby hindering peaceful change.
The longer Putin remains in power, the more devastating his regime’s final act will be.
But, this August, the crisis was purely man-made –&nbsp;indeed, made by one man.
A third, Yekaterina Samutsevich, followed them to prison 12 days later.
They repeated ad nauseam that the cathedral was constructed as a monument to the victory over Napoleon, the 200th anniversary of which is being commemorated this year.
The political character of the performance was studiously ignored, and the verdict of the judge, who sentenced the trio to two years in prison, proved to be the show trial’s scandalous dénouement.
Over the same period, the population of the United States has grown from 248 million to more than 300 million.
(Putin is courting the other ex-Soviet Central Asian countries, as well as Ukraine and Georgia).
His presence is an embarrassment to NATO, but an even greater disgrace for Russia.
It is all the more important that we remember this today, because these threats are not becoming fewer, but are only transforming and changing their appearance.
The primary purpose of Russia’s foreign policy seems to be to tap Russia’s state companies for the benefit of Kremlin officials.
Russia’s nationalists are also outraged by Putin’s foreign policy, because it has alienated former Soviet republics and weakened Russia’s military.
Putin\u0027s Puppies and Russian Democracy
Countries with per capita incomes close to the current Russian level sustain democracy for 15-20 years on average. Russian democracy, born in 1991, may be nearing its expiration date.
The population is declining, but immigration is blocked for ideological reasons.
In the late 1980's, Mikhail Gorbachev announced that Russian oil was practically exhausted.
You cannot deceive people about growth; they feel the weight of their pockets better than anyone else.
Their profession has become so important in recent years that there is now a special "Day of the Political Consultant" in Russia every February 25.
Or is the system simply that of a conniving authoritarian? This view is already conventional wisdom, not only in America, but in Europe as well.
So who is responsible for the fact that liberal democracy has ended in Russia? Well, Putin, of course, and Yeltsin before him.
Under the current soft authoritarian regime, I can see only one rather negative scenario for the future: authentic, full-fledged dictatorship.
He will and he won’t.
Moreover, he appears to believe that confrontations between the state and civil society are counterproductive.
More broadly, as the head of Putin’s presidential administration, Medvedev directly oversaw the construction of today’s authoritarian system of Russian governance.
What if Putin is wrong in his choice of successor, and Medvedev refuses to be his clone, but instead follows in the footsteps of Khrushchev, Gorbachev, and Yeltsin? What if the supposed puppet starts to pull the strings?
Russians should be demanding a solution to their country’s economic troubles, not praising the leader who caused them.
If Russian businesspeople repatriate their offshore accounts, their financial indiscretions will be forgiven and forgotten.
Of course, it is not the tycoons who will bear the brunt of the economic crisis.
They still do.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Putin’s main European interlocutor, has been expressing her frustration with Russian policy toward Ukraine in increasingly harsh terms.
Likewise, though establishing a Confucius Institute in Manila to teach Filipino people about Chinese culture may help to cultivate China’s soft power, its impact will be severely constrained if China is simultaneously using its hard power to bully the Philippines in the territorial dispute over the Scarborough Shoal.
Instead, even as the Games were proceeding, Putin launched a semi-covert military intervention in Ukraine, which, together with his talk of Russian nationalism, has induced severe anxiety, particularly among ex-Soviet countries.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the BBC retains its credibility because it can bite the government hand that feeds it.
It also played a critical role in the collapse of communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. And it certainly contributed to the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych – a key Putin ally – in 2014.
Meanwhile, Russian oligarchs have been purchasing European newspapers, including The Independent, The Evening Standard, and France-Soir.
Unfortunately, the European establishment is not doing enough to counter Moscow’s anti-European, divide-and-rule offensive.
But opportunism is not ideological affinity.
Given Putinism’s uncertain ideological roots, this turn toward Russia might seem puzzling.
(Similarly, Mussolini was filmed bare-chested, harvesting corn.)
Having been born in the early 1960’s, my generation remembers two crises.

There is a good reason for this docility.
Don’t worry, Russia’s oligarchs are not starving, but the fortunes of many of them have collapsed.
Fortunately, Russians know how to survive hard times.
But, while he refuses to spell out his plans for remaining in power once his second term expires next spring, his economic policy is clear.
His only “mass” meeting in Moscow drew no more than 5,000 people.
Personal authoritarianism rarely survives its founder.
Although corruption has been declining in most of the former Soviet Union, it has surged in Russia since 2004, becoming more rationalized and concentrated. None of Putin’s KGB kingpins has been arrested or even demoted.
Monetary policy has been loose for the last year, and before the Duma election the government started pouring huge sums into pensions and other social welfare transfers.
In general, each one represents a task – something to read, a query to answer, a meeting to schedule, a bill to pay, a request to fulfill or deny, even a friend’s post to like.
But there is another way: The sender figures out what matters, and puts money behind that choice.
Isn’t it unfair to cut off access? Does it restrict freedom of speech?
Over time, a variety of specialist service providers will emerge – single-topic experts and general mail managers.
As for consumer customers, most companies already make you pay by filling in an annoying form that asks you for a bunch of irrelevant items before you can send a help request. They will probably keep that feature, and add a $10 e-mail hotline address.
Yet there are 2.8 billion people under the age of 25 out of a world population of six billion.
One thing is certain: old solutions to old problems won't work.
The Sarajevo conference is a step in the right direction.
Using its vast resources, and driven by unbridled ambition, Qatar has emerged as a hub for radical Islamist movements.
Qatar hosts Al Udeid air base – with its 8,000 American military personnel and 120 aircraft, including supertankers for in-flight refueling – from which the US directs its current airstrikes in Syria and Iraq.
This competitive dynamic, which surfaced only recently, represents a shift from a long history of working in tandem to export Islamist extremism.
Qatar’s leaders are willing to challenge their neighbors for a simple reason: They believe that the grassroots Islamist movements they support – which, in their view, represent majority political aspirations – eventually will win.
It hosts Israeli spokespersons and embraces state-of-the-art broadcasting techniques.
Simply put, the Al Jazeera success story would not have been possible without Qatar’s backing.
So, while the Arab Spring has been a genuine popular uprising against decades of corrupt and oppressive authoritarian regimes, its rapid spread, which caught almost everyone by surprise, was due in part to the influence of Al Jazeera, which became the voice of the voiceless throughout the Middle East.
BEIJING – It is a story that has played out worldwide.
The McKinsey Global Institute projects that new Web applications could enable as much as 22% of China’s total GDP growth through 2025.
Though China’s government established preliminary rules governing online privacy in 2012, many gray areas remain, including basic issues like the types of information companies can share, how that information can be used, and what constitutes consumer consent.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in banks’ current scramble to defend their territory from online financial-services providers.
Others, especially on the political right, worried that the latest monetary measures would fuel future inflation and encourage unbridled government spending.
Monetary policy has proven ineffective, and more of it is unlikely to return the economy to sustainable growth.
But most of the wealthy know that temporary measures result only in a fleeting blip in stock prices – hardly enough to support a consumption splurge.
To allay anxiety about government profligacy, the ECB built conditionality into its bond-purchase program.
CAMBRIDGE – There is no doubt that the American economy rallied strongly at the end of 2010.
Real personal consumer spending grew at a robust 4.4% rate, as spending on consumer durables soared by 21%.
To be sure, there is no proof that QE2 led to the stock-market rise, or that the stock-market rise caused the increase in consumer spending.
Without that increase in stock-market wealth, will the saving rate continue to decline and the pace of consumer spending continue to rise more rapidly than GDP?
But, intended or not, the increased supply of dollars also affects the international value of the dollar.
The Chinese government, acting through the People’s Bank of China, determines the renminbi’s exchange rate.
But it is clear that the fall of the renminbi against other currencies that has resulted from the Fed’s policy of quantitative easing now gives the Chinese scope for more rapid appreciation of the renminbi relative to the dollar.
“Monetary policy's power is limited, particularly when the interest rate is so low," some said.
Japan, by contrast, hesitated to expand its money supply substantially, leaving the yen's exchange rate against the US dollar to appreciate to 76 (from less than 100 before the Lehman crisis), and causing GDP growth to decline further.
After nearly two decades of recession, the Japanese economy was growing again – and it had Abenomics to thank for it.
At last year's World Knowledge Forum, several leading central bankers – including former BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, and former Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong-soo – also dismissed the potential of unconventional monetary policy.
But, in an economy where debt has exploded to more than 200% of GDP, it is not easy to rein in growth gradually without triggering widespread failure of ambitious investment projects.
Of course, Chinese growth almost surely fluctuates far more than the official numbers reveal, in part because local officials have incentives to smooth the data that they report to the central authorities.
Unfortunately, China’s data are not nearly as reliable as those measuring a developed economy, which makes it difficult for anyone to be sure of what is happening.
The potential vulnerability of Western exports and equity prices is massive.
How credible will an anti-corruption message be when delivered by an appointee of what is considered one of the most corrupt and incompetent administrations in US history?
When our research showed that certain policies (like agricultural subsidies) were hurting developing countries, we publicized the findings, helping to redefine the debate.
Do you think countries that are corrupt should be cut off from funding? If so, will do you so in a consistent way?
It has done enough damage.
Indeed, the regime welcomed George W. Bush and his neo-con administration, because it allowed Iran’s leaders to close ranks, and at the same time delivered free access to influence in Iraq and Afghanistan.
One of the first successful revolutions of this kind, and certainly the most important, took place in China in 1949.
In the long run, though, rule by bayonet rarely works.
As a result, Turkey, not Iran, is on track to become this century’s key Middle Eastern power.
He also cancelled the debts of some small producers and raised the prices paid by the state for milk and meat.
Cuba’s government argues that America’s financial and political support for the opposition impedes that.
Shortages of medicines and basic foodstuffs such as milk, sugar, eggs, beef, and chicken abound as a consequence of price controls and mounting inflation.
Raúl replaced Fidel as President of the Councils of Ministers and of State, but not as First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party.
Accepting a Cuban exception would represent an enormous setback.
Race and Republicanism
Indeed, many argue that by refusing to take into account distinctions linked to ethnic and religious origin, these distinctions are legitimized.
But government statisticians have long been studying the national origins of immigrants, and are permitted to indicate the previous nationality of people who have acquired French citizenship.
The ban against ethnic and racial data is a taboo that should not be overthrown easily, and not without carefully weighing the risk to social peace.
Obama is consistently criticized for his “otherness” and his “arrogance,” terms that call to mind the image of the “uppity nigger” from the days of segregation, which are actually not so far in America’s past.
But his continuing difficulties with white working-class voters, who in the primaries went with Hillary Clinton, suggest that, perhaps, the “Bradley effect” is still alive and well.
Whether or not her judgment carries a racist undertone, as many observers believe, the polls indicate that many Americans agree.
Marxist ideology had become all but a façade; not even party apparatchiks pretended to believe it.
Exhausted, the Polish Communist regime agreed to sit down to talks with Solidarity.
Once a peripheral European country economically and politically, Poland has become one of Europe’s leading states and a co-shaper of its future.
His place in the history books is guaranteed.
It is more often an act of war, albeit war by the weak rather than by organized states and their armies.
Since 2011, the CIA and US allies have poured in weapons, finance, and training in an attempt to topple President Bashar al-Assad.
The terrorists themselves cast their actions in political terms, even though we rarely listen; indeed, the terrorists’ words are typically reported only briefly, if at all.
The UK no longer needs to protect its trade routes to colonial India, and the US no longer needs a ring of military bases to contain the Soviet Union.
पर्यावरण और विकास संबंधी ढाँचों को परस्पर मिलाना एक अच्छा विचार है - यह जलवायु की रक्षा, जैव-विविधता के संरक्षण, मानव अधिकारों को बनाए रखने, और गरीबी को कम करने के लिए संयुक्त राष्ट्र के तत्वावधान में तैयार किए गए कानूनी तौर पर बाध्यकारी अनेक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सम्मेलनों और समझौतों की सफलता पर आधारित होता है। हालाँकि वे संभवतः परिपूर्ण नहीं होते हैं - और, दुर्भाग्यवश, जो देश उनकी पुष्टि करते हैं वे हमेशा लक्ष्य हासिल नहीं करते है - उनसे ऐसी संस्थागत प्रक्रियाओं के निर्माण का मार्ग प्रशस्त हुआ है जिनसे देश अपने वादों को पूरा करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित होते हैं और नागरिक सरकारों को जवाबदेह ठहराने के लिए प्रोत्साहित होते हैं।

मुंबई - जब विश्व वैश्विक आर्थिक संकट से उबरने के लिए जूझ रहा है, तो लगता है कि कई उन्नत देशों ने इसके परिप्रेक्ष्य में जो अपरंपरागत मौद्रिक नीतियाँ अपनाईं, उन्हें व्यापक स्वीकृति मिली है। परंतु जिन अर्थव्यवस्थाओं में ऋण का भार बहुत अधिक है, नीति अनिश्चित है, या ढाँचागत सुधार की आवश्यकता के कारण घरेलू माँग में बाधा उत्पन्न होती है, उनके मामले में यह प्रश्न उचित है कि क्या इन नीतियों के घरेलू लाभ अन्य अर्थव्यवस्थाओं को हुए हानिकारक अतिप्रवाह से ज़्यादा हैं।
इसी तर्ज़ पर, देशों के लिए यह जायज़ हो जाएगा कि वे उसे अपनाएँ जिसे वे “परिमाणात्मक बाह्य सहजता” (QEE) कह सकते हैं, जिसमें केंद्रीय बैंक भारी प्रारक्षित निधियों का निर्माण करते हुए, अपनी विनिमय दरों को कम रखने के लिए हस्तक्षेप कर सकते हैं। यदि शुद्ध अतिप्रवाह अंतर्राष्ट्रीय रूप से स्वीकार्य नीति का निर्धारण नहीं करते, तो बहुपक्षीय संस्थाएँ यह दावा नहीं कर सकती हैं कि परिमाणात्मक बाह्य सहजता (QEE) से खेल के नियमों का उल्लंघन होता है, चाहे इससे कितनी भी अस्थिरता का ख़तरा क्यों न होता हो।

पिछले दो दशकों में, एचआईवी, तपेदिक और मलेरिया का मुकाबला करने में आश्चर्यजनक सफलता मिली है। अफ़्रीका में कुछ देशों में नए एचआईवी संक्रमणों में 50% जितनी अधिक तक की कमी हुई है, एड्स-संबंधी रोगों के मामले में मौतों की संख्या में 30-48% तक की कमी हुई है; तपेदिक के मामलों में 40% तक की कमी हुई है, और मलेरिया के मामलों में 30% तक की कमी हुई है।
लेकिन यदि भुखमरी की लगात पर विचार किया जाए तो यह लागत उतनी अधिक चुनौतीपूर्ण नहीं लगती है। यूनिसेफ के अनुमान के अनुसार अफ़्रीका के बाल कुपोषण की लागत $25 बिलियन प्रति वर्ष है। और यह पूरी कहानी नहीं है। कुपोषण के कारण उत्पादकता की हानि और स्वास्थ्य देखभाल की उच्च लागतों के फलस्वरूप वैश्विक अर्थव्यवस्था पर अनुमानतः $3.5 ट्रिलियन प्रति वर्ष की लागत आती है।
कुपोषण जीवन के पहले पाँच हज़ार दिनों के दौरान सबसे अधिक क्षति पहुँचाता है जिसके फलस्वरूप शिशुओं के स्वास्थ्य पर गंभीर और अपरिवर्तनीय परिवर्तन होते हैं। अदृश्य भुखमरी के मामले में सचमुच सफलता पाने के लिए अफ़्रीका की सरकारों को वैश्विक विकास के साझेदारों की मदद से शीघ्रतापूर्वक कार्रवाई करनी चाहिए। अफ़्रीका में बाल भुखमरी के जानलेवा होने के लिए उसका उतना अधिक प्रभावशाली होना ज़रूरी नहीं है जितना कि कार्टर के 1993 के चित्र में दर्शाया गया है।
In many cases, the importance of ratings comes partly from legal requirements that oblige or encourage institutional investors and investment vehicles to maintain portfolios of assets that have received sufficiently high grades from the recognized agencies.
This can be done by making raters’ profits depend not on satisfying the issuers that select them, but on performing well for investors.
Standard &amp; Poor argued that such a mechanism would provide credit rating agencies with “less incentive to compete with one another, pursue innovation, and improve their models, criteria, and methodologies.”
But the American election’s implications for immigration run deeper than electoral expediency – with lessons for governments around the world.
A recent transatlantic survey by the German Marshall Fund found that, while majorities in all countries were worried about illegal immigration, anxiety about legal immigration was low – with only 26% of European&#160;respondents expressing concern, and just 18% doing so in the United States.
And, in a world in which nearly half of migrants are now moving from one developing country to another, the problems are no longer confined to the West.
This, after all, is what democratic politics is all about.
But the Alliance refused to hold the scheduled meeting following the Georgia crisis.
Already we can name three “growth factors” that will help the new security system to mature – the development of the European Security and Defense Policy, the transformation of NATO, and Russia’s return to its rightful position on the world stage.
The Warsaw Pact ceased to exist 20 years ago, but NATO still proceeds eastward, adding new member states for reasons other than enhancing security and democracy.
A real, working NATO-Russia relationship could provide the Alliance with solutions to problems that it cannot tackle on its own.
Considering them together, my overwhelming thought is that the Friedmans would find their task of justifying and advocating small-government libertarianism much harder today than they did in 1979.
In the United States, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has executed the Friedmanite playbook flawlessly in the current downturn, and it has not been enough to preserve or rapidly restore full employment.
The end of American preeminence in education, the collapse of private-sector unions, the emergence of a winner-take-all information-age economy, and the return of Gilded Age-style high finance have produced an extraordinarily unequal pre-tax distribution of income, which will burden the next generation and make a mockery of equality of opportunity.
Too often, our politicians disparage Europe and impute to it evils (like unemployment) that are really the result of domestic insufficiencies.
A united Europe can respond to these dangers in ways that no single state can.
It is as far from being a controlled economy as it is from resembling the libertarian anarchism that many French opponents of the constitutional treaty fear.
We need founding fathers – or mothers – and nations moved by a clear understanding of their interests and a popular enthusiasm for European integration.
The Dayton Accords of 1995 ended Serb-instigated ethnic cleansing and established peace in Bosnia.
Such assumptions do not inspire confidence. Violence has been the traditional agent of change in the Balkans, and the level of frustration in Bosnia is growing.
·         Support for civil-society groups and democratic parties prior to elections throughout Bosnia this October.
The “reset” of relations with Russia can succeed only if it is reciprocal.
But such a strategy requires that Russia clearly demonstrate its political will to cooperate with NATO. Russia must make a choice.
We must also redefine common threats, while strengthening the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s mechanisms for preventing, managing, and resolving conflicts.
The coming NATO and OSCE summits in Lisbon and Astana offer a unique opportunity to move the Euro-Atlantic alliance and Russia towards an inclusive, cooperative, and effective security community.
There appears to be no single answer. But one common pattern that does emerge is that the jihadi message, because it promises meaning and identity, seems to appeal particularly to people who are unsure about who they are and where they are heading.
The study’s conclusions applied only to Germany, but its main findings were largely corroborated by a Gallup global survey.
But, as protagonists in the complex web of interaction between the Muslim and the Western worlds, they view militant terrorism as their preferred option.
Read China’s Lips
As a result, China surpassed Japan in late 2008 as the largest foreign holder of US financial assets.
With US government debt repayment now in play, the very concept of dollar-based riskless assets is in doubt.
At the same time, it recognizes the need to address these geopolitical tensions.
That could bring its current account into balance – or even into slight deficit – by 2015.
Reaffirming Europe
So a return of economic, social, or political nationalism is simply not an option.
Extending the EU’s area of freedom and democracy, peace, stability, and prosperity, especially throughout south-eastern Europe, is in the interest of every European citizen.
The latter, however, should be ready to share the burden with us.
But, as the European Union ponders what to do, cold realism, not hysterical overreaction, is in order.
The Cold War was an endurance race between two similarly strong rivals, the weaker of which eventually had to give up.
But not only Russia has changed; so has the entire world.
·        a greater EU commitment to Ukraine to safeguard its independence;
The Washington mountain has labored and brought forth less than a mouse.
Instead of a democratic transformation, were the US to withdraw now, the Middle East would face a war of all against all for regional hegemony.
Instead of victory, the goal must be a minimum of stability – and this still seems achievable.
But with appropriate preparation, a regional solution is possible, and, of all the parties involved, Syria is uniquely positioned to help bring it about.
If successful, the bargain should also aim at a total normalization of relations between Iran and the US.
But Iran, too, harbors illusions, including the notion that it can count on support from non-Western countries, or at least from some sort of Islamic caucus.
People remain convinced that next year, or maybe the year after, the prediction will come true.
Iran may be capable of producing sufficient nuclear material to make one or two bombs within the next couple of years, but such activities would inevitably come into the open, because Iran would either have to enrich the uranium under the eyes of IAEA inspectors or expel them, giving the game away.
Do negotiations stand any chance of success with Ahmadinejad as president? The answer is “no” if our objective remains forcing Iran to renounce all activity on centrifugation.
And, because eurozone banks hold a substantial part of their assets in the form of eurozone sovereign bonds, the sovereign-debt crisis became a potential banking crisis, worsened by banks’ other losses, owing, for example, to the collapse of housing prices in Spain.
As long as this internal divergence persists, the euro crisis cannot be fully resolved, because current-account deficits and/or slow growth will continue to stalk the southern European countries, perpetuating worries about sovereign debt and commercial banks.
Reversing the large differential in unit labor costs that has emerged in the euro’s first decade thus requires not only wage restraint and productivity-enhancing reforms in the south, but also higher wage gains in the north.
CAMBRIDGE – As the global economy stabilizes, there is a growing danger that the United States and China will slip back into their pre-crisis economic patterns, placing themselves and the rest of the world at risk.
Nevertheless, there is cause for concern.
In addition to tighter credit, falling home prices and high unemployment will continue to put a crimp on US consumer spending. 
Rebuilding Euro Governance
There was no support for centralizing any significant elements of fiscal policy – nor is there today.
Increasingly, the small spreads between sovereign bonds relied on the implicit assumption that no euro area member would be allowed to get into major difficulties, despite the constraints imposed on intergovernmental rescue operations.
Improved surveillance – and the scary experience of having confronted the potential costs of being deprived of access to international financial markets – offers hope that the decentralized model for the euro area’s non-monetary policy components will work better than in the past.
Right now, the international relief efforts in Haiti are rightly focused on the country’s urban areas, which suffered most in the earthquake.
IFAD funded a program to kick-start food production.
Much-needed capital investment can enable smallholder farmers to provide the private sector with a sustainable supply of high-quality agricultural produce.
Indeed, the private sector has a pivotal role to play in rural development, not just in Haiti but throughout the developing world.
Asylum seekers have been the main victims.
And, to do that, it must share the burden fairly – a principle that a qualified majority finally established at last Wednesday’s summit.
In addition, the EU also should help create special economic zones with preferred trade status in the region, including in Tunisia and Morocco, to attract investment and generate jobs for both locals and refugees.
This will require negotiating with frontline countries, in cooperation with the UN Refugee Agency, to establish processing centers there – with Turkey as the priority.
Recession Geopolitics
US financial institutions should have continued to lend to distressed borrowers, in order to prevent a spiral in which credit rationing forced price reductions and intensified world deflation.
For a moment, it looked as if a contagious crisis, driven by fears of government over-indebtedness, would destroy the politically fragile compromise that European countries had carefully constructed over a 50-year period. The turning point in this spring’s euro panic came when big holders of reserve currencies signaled that they saw the need for the euro as an alternative to the increasingly problematic dollar and the equally vulnerable yen.
Since the early twentieth century, Mexicans have felt worried and threatened by American strength.
Such insurance, they argue, would help firms and people deal with the “extreme uncertainty” of the current economic environment.
The IMF authors are not saying that governments should do this with recession insurance, so perhaps they mean that governments would auction off the policies, which would create a market price.
The Assura Group had to get permission from the New York State Department of Insurance to have a dynamic rate filing, meaning that they will set prices by a formula, rather than using a fixed rate, so that their prices vary in rapid response to changing economic conditions.
There are uncertainties with any really new proposal.
It all looks as if the need to integrate communities within nations, to reconcile them with their past in order to unite them around a common identity and therefore a common project for the future, has replaced Europe’s now-completed mission of reconciling old enemies like Germany and France.
The silence that surrounded Holocaust survivors during the immediate postwar reconstruction of Europe has been replaced by gestures of contrition and reparation.
And it has concluded that centuries of slavery amount to the equivalent of the Holocaust. European recognition of crimes against the Jews, they argue, must be followed by an admission of guilt towards the Continent’s black minorities.
GAZA/JERUSALEM – As representatives of Hamas and Fatah meet for the fourth round of national unity talks in Cairo, not only Palestinians but also Americans and Europeans will be watching closely.
Whereas Fatah favors a clear majority voting system, Hamas calls for a more personalized approach.
In the absence of a strong central authority, the predominant divide between secular nationalism and politicized religion has led to the actual geographic disintegration of the Palestinian Territories into two distinct parts.
But a modified and more pragmatic stance that focuses on Hamas’s behavior on the ground, rather than on abstract conditions, would not only be demanding for Western decision makers; it would pose a major political challenge for Hamas as well.
Given the innumerable atrocities that the FARC have committed, the prospect of suspending punishment is difficult to accept. But prolonging a conflict that has already led to more than 200,000 deaths and displaced roughly five million people is in no one’s interest.
Following this logic, FARC leader Pablo Catatumbo has acknowledged the “pain and acts of cruelty” that the guerillas have committed and has requested a collective pardon that would cover human-rights violations committed by both the FARC and state security forces.
Even an economy as impoverished as Haiti’s is a complex system dependent on trade between rural and urban areas, transport, electricity, port services, and government functions.
The economy will have a simple structure in the coming years, with most economic activities focused in five sectors: smallholder, or peasant, agriculture; reconstruction; port services and light manufacturing; local small-scale trade; and public services, including health care and education.
Haiti, like its next-door neighbor, the Dominican Republic, once created jobs in port facilities, including production of clothing, baseballs, and other light-manufacturing items.
In addition, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of native Haitian NGOs.
We therefore need money in the bank, and clear leadership.
The first results to be counted were for Kenya’s parliament, with Kibaki’s government ministers roundly defeated in their local constituencies.
As a result, many more votes were recorded by the ECK for the presidential race than for the parliamentary race, even though voters were clearly instructed – indeed required – to cast a vote in both races.   
Second, she claimed that there had been vote rigging “on both sides,” and suggested that the true election results were very close and that perhaps Kibaki had won.
By standing up for democratic principles, the world would truly stand on the side of the Kenyan people.
If Kibaki rejects an independent recount, his refusal will reverberate around Kenya and the world.
First, I argued that while it might do local good, it would damage the rules of international relations as they were then understood.
Despite this, the term “genocide,” freely bandied about by Western interventionists, was grotesquely inappropriate at any time.
As then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan rightly argued, this opened the door to the proliferation of unilateral, lawless use of force.  
But world leaders should take them seriously.
Moreover, the shift from recovery efforts to fiscal consolidation and, more recently, to current-account rebalancing, has undermined the initial G-20-led coordinated recovery efforts.
Understandably, China has resisted, probably mindful of the post-1985 yen appreciation’s association with the end of Japan’s four-decade-long post-war boom.
Recovery before Reform

Then the Money Power struck back, aided and abetted by its apologist cohort of economists.
National regulators are exploring ways to vary ratio requirements over the business cycle, and have started subjecting banks to regular “stress tests.”
But little progress has been made in (re)implementing this idea.
Redefining Sustainable Development
For almost three decades, sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising future generations’ ability to meet their needs.
The process of identifying the Sustainable Development Goals, which are intended to enter into force in 2015, has begun in earnest.
And achieving food security is impossible without agricultural systems and practices that not only support farmers and produce enough food to meet people’s nutritional needs, but that also preserve natural resources by, for example, preventing soil erosion and relying on more efficient nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers.
Moreover, technological progress is becoming ever more “labor-saving,” with computers and robots replacing human workers in settings ranging from supermarkets to automobile assembly lines. Given the volatile macroeconomic outlook, many firms are reluctant to hire new workers, leading to high youth unemployment throughout the world.
Maternity and paternity leave should be increased where it is low, such as in the United States.
The recent G-20 summit occurred with virtually no real preliminary work.
After all, if the economy is to grow again, banks need borrowers, but the recession has led entrepreneurs to cut their investments.
Until that point, America’s pledge to maintain the gold standard was the basis for the global fixed-exchange-rate system, which was the heart of the Bretton Woods framework.
Under their pressure, more and more processes were “outsourced.”
Redesigning European Energy Security
Aside from devising a single energy strategy to deal with Russia, however, the EU must enhance its cooperation with the Kremlin on such issues as nuclear policy and counter-terrorism in order to foster warmer relations in general.
A solar or wind lobby can be just as self-serving as an oil or gas lobby, while excessive government involvement in the energy sector through subsidies or restrictive regulation can distort natural market conditions and ultimately damage alternative energy development. Similarly, EU-wide collaboration on research and development and on subsidy programs should be encouraged in order to prevent individual member states’ policies from undercutting each other’s efforts.
The absence of a European “grand strategy,” together with the way Europeans undercut each other, leaves these issues unresolved, and in some cases exacerbates the problems.
We strongly support the Burmese opposition’s campaign calling on the country’s citizens to reject the constitution, which does not promote human rights, but only confirms the military’s political role.
The UN Security Council should consider introducing a universal arms embargo, and the EU should adopt banking sanctions that target the regime and its cronies.
After all, the oft-repeated principle that the IMF’s managing director should be chosen on the basis of merit rather than nationality need not mean a departure from past practice.
These countries do not have the excessive budget deficits that many European countries ran up during the last expansion – and that are culminating in today’s mismanaged sovereign-debt crisis.
·Agustín Carstens, the governor of Mexico’s central bank, has been described as the leading prospect among the group.
She became one of the World Bank’s three managing directors last year, after apparently being forced out as Indonesia’s finance minister for doing too good a job.
·Montek Ahluwalia is Deputy Chairman of India’s Planning Commission, a position far more important than it sounds.
New types of loyalty and association are challenging the state’s traditional role.
A global reordering of economic growth is punishing the developed countries’ high-cost, high-tax, high-benefits governance model.
The question for international governance is how to provide a framework of institutions and rules in a world of competing organizational structures.
That is not good enough.
As it stands, European economic output per capita remains well below 2008 levels.
These recommendations are based not on theoretical academic fancy, but on policies that are already proving their worth in at least one European country.
This is not gimmickry; it is a sensible distinction between current and capital accounts, a staple of public finance.
Yet Europe has been struggling for years, even as other economies have engineered recoveries.
The need for an effective UN Security Council reflects the central strategic certainty of the post-Cold War period: security threats are no longer likely to take the form of war between states, but will instead consist in acts of terror, civil wars, and massacres of civilian populations.
For the Security Council to be effective in providing global governance in the domain of security, it must be reformed to reflect the realities of the twenty-first century.
A far-reaching reform will be difficult, and some may regard it as beyond our reach.
The Commission is chaired by Sir John Vickers, the Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, which in British academia is about as good as it gets. At his side sits Martin Wolf of The Financial Times, so a good reception in the pink pages can be expected.
“The social costs would be significant,” he warns, as the synergies between deposit-taking and lending would be lost.
One reform that does find favor is what the Commission describes as a “retail ring-fence.”
Reforming Macho Politics
All countries, for example, should adopt quotas requiring that no more than half of parties’ legislative candidates in each district be of the same sex.
Such legislation must also have rigid compliance standards that are reviewed and enforced by the state’s electoral authorities and courts.
President Xi’s Singapore Lessons
The success of both countries reflects many contributing factors, including a skilled and educated group of policymakers supplied by a meritocratic selection system, and a pragmatic, disciplined, experimental, and forward-looking approach to policy.
To maintain single-party legitimacy – and thus the ability to govern – those narrower interests must be overridden in favor of the general interest.
And then they should return to the task of governing in a complex domestic and global environment.
Reforming Russia’s Military Industrial Complex
The percentage of the defense budget allocated to purchasing military equipment will rise from 44% in 2006 to 50% by 2011.
Moreover, where the USSR transferred much weaponry under easy commercial terms or without charge (e.g., under long-term loans not expected to be repaid), Russia now discounts arms only for its closest allies.
Russian officials also contend that US and other foreign objections often reflect a desire to eliminate unwelcome Russian competition or curtail the Kremlin’s influence in important regions, such as Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
But what is meant by unacceptable varies greatly from country to country.
After all, much of what makes a house a habitat lies outside of his department’s purview.
It artificially creates – as in France – socially homogenous poor neighborhoods where the unskilled live among themselves, disconnected from others, making it harder for them to benefit from the agglomeration economies that would boost their productivity.
They are bound to choose older homes in established neighborhoods that have already been connected to the many networks that make them a habitat.
A more useful framework would view the state and the market as two sides of the same coin, bound together by the property-rights infrastructure (PRI).
For a large economy like China – which has overlapping bureaucracies in different state agencies, and many layers of government extending from the central administration to local units – creating a transparent, fair, and effective PRI is particularly complex.
Given this, China’s continued economic success depends on reducing state ownership of productive capital, facilitating market innovation and growth, and investing in human capital, such as through education, health care, and social welfare.
In order to navigate the complex market-state relationship and achieve a beneficial outcome, Chinese policymakers must have a clear idea of where the state’s limited capacity and political capital are needed most.
For their part, Western countries must avoid the traps of the difficult negotiation process that the deal demands, without losing sight of their strategic goal of ending the conflict.
Likewise, the West must recognize that reconciliation in Syria will be impossible without reconciliation between the Sunni and Shia regimes in the wider region.
The West’s lofty and self-serving rhetoric has not helped to end Syria’s conflict; it may even have made the situation more dangerous.
Hope gives way to prolonged misery – not for a few months or even a year, but on average for more than a decade.
In 2014, education received just 1% of humanitarian funds – leaving millions of children and young people on the streets or idle in camps.
Complicating the situation, officials have had to persuade a divided country, already worried about the influx of refugees (which has added 20% to the country’s population).
Similarly, in Pakistan, the Peshawar massacre last month has revealed how much more must be done to protect schools and children’s future.
In short, no.
But the refugee crisis has exposed the flipside of the Schengen Agreement – namely, the difficulty of monitoring national and EU territory without border controls.
But the issues they raise are not the same.
The question is whether Europe’s politicians – who have failed to deliver on far less complicated issues over which they had a lot more control – can seize the moment.
European politicians have yet to catch up with the reality on the ground, let alone get ahead of it.
Already, it is unlocking additional fiscal outlays in countries like Germany – which, despite having the means, did not previously have the will to spend – thereby helping to alleviate an aggregate-demand imbalance that, together with structural impediments to growth and excessive indebtedness in some countries, has held back the region’s recovery.
BRUSSELS – The tragic exodus of people from war-torn Syria and surrounding countries challenges the world’s reason and sympathy.
The 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees recognized a right of asylum for those unable to return to their country of origin owing to a “well founded” fear of persecution.
This is justified by the fiction that the citizens of EU countries are members of a single polity.
The US and Russia back different sides.
The Limits of the German Promised Land
Between €1,000 ($1,120) and €1,200 per person per month is being transferred to the municipalities to cover the costs of accommodating them.
But the proportion of Syrian refugees subsequently ballooned quickly, in part because the news spread that Germany approves most Syrian applications.
Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees could set up border outposts to clear baseless asylum claims and send the rejected applicants, in accordance with the Dublin Regulation, back to the first safe country they reached.
Fiscal positions are solid and public debt amounts to only 32% of the region’s GDP.
The Fed’s policy of quantitative easing exacerbates the flow of excess liquidity, which could result in dangerous bubbles in emerging markets.
While Chile has not yet intervened in the foreign-exchange market, Colombia and Peru have increased their international reserves massively.
The failure of jihadism is paving the way for a potentially promising restructuring of Islamic politics, but the West either doesn’t recognize the changes or is hostile to them.
Just as Islamic democracy is the natural reaction to Arab secular autocracy and to the West’s collaboration with it, so will the destruction of political Islam usher in even more extreme options with movements like Hamas going back to social work and terror, and with al-Qaeda making inroads into Islamic societies.
The practical necessities of politics are bound to dilute ideological purity.
Indeed, addressing the underlying security concerns that fuel nuclear competition in regional trouble spots is more important to the credibility of Global Zero’s goal of “a world without nuclear weapons” than is encouraging exemplary behavior by the two major nuclear powers.
A country that in the summer of 2006 had to send a million of its citizens to underground shelters to escape massive ballistic warfare conducted by a non-state agent, Hezbollah, now faces an “Islamic Awakening” that it cannot fully fathom, and, with it, an ominous worsening of its strategic environment.
A Middle East free of nuclear weapons certainly is preferable to a region with two or more nuclear-weapons states.
Trade agreements have long stopped being the province of experts and technocrats.
Trade agreements do not create jobs; they simply reallocate them across industries.
In the TTIP, the reduction of so-called non-tariff barriers to trade between the US and Europe will almost certainly restrict the space for domestic regulatory action.
Finally, what especially grates on the agreements’ critics is the secrecy of the negotiations.
And that is possible only if the negotiating texts are opened to public scrutiny.
Unlike any first lady in Argentine history, she is capable and well prepared when discussing complex issues such as money laundering or labor law.
In the Argentina of the 1940’s and 1950’s, Evita gathered multitudes.
The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo became the same: they would put their motherhood above their lives.
Cristina loves being compared to Hillary.
BRUSSELS – The most visible symptom of the crisis in the eurozone has been the high and variable risk premiums that its peripheral countries now must pay on their public debt.
Indeed, only those countries that were running large current-account deficits before the crisis were affected by it.
First, it has often been pointed out that austerity can be self-defeating, because a reduction in the fiscal deficit can lead in the short run to an increase in the debt/GDP ratio if both the debt level and the multiplier are large.
But the reverse is also true: as soon as the current account swings to surplus, the pressure from financial markets abates.
The first is that the European Union provides the necessary funds on a permanent basis, creating a “European Transfer Union” to the benefit of the deficit countries, including Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy.
While that would stimulate inward tourism and real-estate sales, what sounds easy and manageable to the layman would in fact be the most problematic solution for Greece, because it would add fuel to internal protests to a point that could destabilize the eastern Mediterranean.
·        The German system. In Germany, a “stability council” must approve state budgets.
All of this is unpleasant, and it may not appeal to politicians who believe in dreams.
Indeed, the idea that bubbles exist has become so disreputable in much of the economics and finance profession that bringing them up in an economics seminar is like bringing up astrology to a group of astronomers.
They live in a world where economic decisions are fundamentally ambiguous, because the future doesn’t seem to be a mere repetition of a quantifiable past.
Economists have also been right to apply his theory to a range of microeconomic issues, such as why monopolists set higher prices.
This will happen as economists’ redirect their research efforts by listening to scientists with different expertise.
And, in many places, oil supplies are declining as old oil fields are depleted.
And solar power plants in the Sahel of Africa, just south of the vast Sahara, could supply power to much of West, East, and Central Africa. 
It is shocking, and worrisome, that public financing remains slight, because these technologies’ success could translate into literally trillions of dollars of economic output.
PRINCETON – The euro crisis and Queen Elizabeth’s recent Jubilee seem to have nothing in common.
It is through Homer that virtually all Western readers first encounter the Mediterranean world: its islands and shores and peoples knit together by diplomacy, trade, marriage, oil, wine, and long ships.
The Turks will not let Cypriot ships into their harbors and have not been on speaking terms with the Israelis since nine Turkish citizens were killed on a ship that sought to breach Israel’s blockade of Gaza.
The EU today is on the ropes, but only a few concrete steps by European leaders might open the door to similarly bold diplomacy that could restore EU and Mediterranean economies and transform the energy politics of Europe and Asia.
At a time when the European Union and the United States are anxious to promote political and economic reform in the Arab world, they should not overlook the Maghreb.
For its part, the US has sponsored a number of specific actions to promote democracy and good governance in the region.
But while the EU is emphasizing its bilateral relations with Maghreb countries, not enough attention – or funding – is being given to the sub-regional dimension.
Although EU assistance from the Barcelona process is significant, it does not have a decisive impact on Maghreb economies.
But the real challenge lies in providing direction for the World Bank that reflects the world as it is, and re-calibrating the Bank’s tools accordingly.
At the same time, the biggest threat to the international order comes from failing, failed, post-conflict, and conflict-ridden states.
It also must strengthen its know-how in capacity-building, particularly administrative capacity-building, with an emphasis on its legal-institutional aspects.
Switching off a TV that no one is watching.
But now a renaissance of their mindset is taking place, as climate change becomes common knowledge.
Why should we conserve? The West was responsible for all the pollution and waste in the first place.
Sunlabob, a private company in Laos, is renting solar lanterns to poor villagers, who find them more affordable than candles.
We already have a deep-rooted tradition of conservation.
But not one person was ever charged with a crime, much less tried and punished.
While some see no contradiction, the fact that many of the collaborators who killed secular and pro-democracy Bengalis in 1971 claimed to be doing so in the name of Islam points to an evident tension.
But, all too often, clichés become established because they are true.
There has been particular interest (most specifically in the case of Islam) as to whether specific religious traditions are compatible with the institutions and values of liberal democracy.
On the institutional level, pluralism means that established religions can no longer take for granted that a particular population will supinely submit to its authority.
From the standpoint of their compatibility with modern liberal democracy, acceptance of pluralism, more than adherence to particular beliefs and practices, may be what most clearly distinguishes religions.
Engagement means that the tradition is carried into the open discourse of the culture, and that those who represent the tradition make unapologetic truth claims.
“I am very sorry,” he said to startled onlookers. “I have come too late.”
Chinese have long since used the deaths of defrocked leaders as occasions to let out sentiments that can find no expression through the normal political process.
He was even the first Chinese leader to wear a suit and tie rather than a Mao habit when traveling abroad, as well as the first to hold an open press conference.
And, while domestic problems may seem intractable, distance increases the confusion and fatigue induced by seemingly intractable international problems.
It is for this reason that I took up the offer from Save the Children to visit the Gaza Strip last week.
There is no electricity for up to eight hours a day.
The Qattan Center for the Child is a privately funded library – and drama, computer, and youth center – that would grace any British community.
That is true, too.
What they need is a chance to shape their own futures.
But there was always more to Schmidt’s outlook on the world: As a son of Germany’s largest port city, he was a committed internationalist, genuinely interested in what lay beyond our borders.
That same year he sat next to East Germany’s leader Erich Honecker in Helsinki while signing the “Final Act” of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe – a major breakthrough for détente policy and in opening the closed societies of the USSR and Warsaw Pact.
Thus, European integration had to be created by real policies and institutions, not by decree. So he and Giscard created the European Council (composed of the heads of Europe’s governments), which is now a major player in the European Union’s institutional set-up.

I felt a prodigious, restless energy that I suspected he could not turn off if he wanted to.  Soon after I began to recount my observations, he took me to a map of Vietnam and asked me to locate the areas of destruction.
A memo recommending these steps was circulated to McNamara, Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach, and Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy.
Thus, the main reason for not fighting the war in the first place, namely the perfectly obvious hatred of the majority of the population for the American invasion and occupation, became a justification for the war.
Should he never have recommended the war, or presided over it in the first place, and should there never been an American war in Vietnam? Oh lord, yes.
In the digital age, the opposite is true: cheap computer storage, powerful processors, and ubiquitous Internet access have made remembering the norm.
Forgetting thus affords us a second chance, individually and as a society, to rise above our past mistakes and misdeeds, to accept that humans change over time.
We have much to gain individually and as a society from sharing information with each other.
The conditions under which Zhao Ziyang lived at the time of his death, in utter isolation from Chinese society due to an illegally imposed 16-year house arrest, shames both Chinese justice and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
But Zhao was also the only CCP leader to propose a political reform package to tackle China’s system of one-party rule.
The only reason for Zhao’s continued ill treatment was his opposition to the violent repression of the Tiananmen Square protest in 1989.
Qiao Shi and Hu Qili initially sided with Zhao, but then withdrew their support and, instead, asked Deng Xiaoping to make the final decision.
The scale of migration from rural to urban areas and across international borders is historically unprecedented, and twenty-first-century Asia is its focal point.
At IFAD, our starting point is always the three billion people who live in the rural areas of developing countries.
The amount of money at stake is staggering: It is estimated that over the next five years, more than $2.5 trillion will be sent in remittances to developing countries, with almost 40% – coming in the form of payments of $50, $100, or $500 at a time – destined for rural areas.
The bulk of this migration happened at a time of civil war or revolution. In other places, massive outmigration occurred in the context of political change, as in Europe when communism collapsed.
The economist Avner Greif argues that these co-ethnic networks’ durability and resilience throughout history reflects their ability to enforce contracts at long distances when the existing institutional framework could not do so reliably.
Evidence of the importance of diasporas is everywhere, if you care to look. Franschhoek (French corner in Afrikaans) is a beautiful valley near Cape Town settled by Huguenots in the late seventeenth century.
Rendezvous with Africa on Climate
The economic, social, migratory, and security consequences of such vulnerability on the rest of the world cannot be ignored, as Africa will be home to more than two billion inhabitants in 2050.
Three promising tracks will have to materialize rapidly.
In the past, African countries found it difficult to make their voices heard in major international negotiations.
In Germany alone, the sector’s growth has generated 250,000 new green jobs in less than ten years.
My answer is yes. This new agency already has immense potential. 
Third, IRENA will be based in a developing country, a vote of confidence in the quality, institutional expertise, and dynamism that exists in the developing world.
ATHENS – The year 2009 has been one of great change, taking place amidst even greater uncertainty.
It is in this spirit of cooperation and bridge-building that 56 foreign ministers – representing the US, Canada, and European countries, including the Russian Federation and the rest of the former Soviet Union – will meet in Athens on December 1-2 on my invitation to discuss the future of European security.
The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the end of an era of mistrust and division, and opened the way for cooperation aimed at a peaceful and stable Europe.
There is a great deal to mourn about the passing of the older news model.
A new form could evolve from this changed power relationship between editors and citizens, potentially becoming as powerful as traditional journalism, if not more so.
I don’t pretend to possess journalism’s Holy Grail: a sustainable business plan for the newspaper of the future.
For these reasons, the US Department of Defense is implementing a “rebalance” of America’s strategic focus and posture to the Asia-Pacific.
We are also working to identify opportunities to deepen our cooperation in information security, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and other high-tech frontiers – from cyberspace to outer space.
For example, the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise was the largest ever, including more than 42 ships and 25,000 personnel from 22 countries, while the US and China staged their first-ever maritime counter-piracy exercise near the Horn of Africa.
Finally, we agreed with Singapore to deploy up to four Littoral Combat Ships there on a rotational basis to join it and other countries in the region for exercises, training, and responses to challenges.
A key component of the rebalance is a healthy, stable, and continuous military-to-military relationship with China, based on sustained and substantive dialogue that enhances our ability to work together and to avoid any kind of miscalculation.
We have a detailed plan for the rebalance in our budget, and we have made decisions that will make our military more cost-effective, efficient, and productive.
This time, China’s current-account surplus has been shrinking significantly, owing to the global recession caused by the collapse of the US financial bubble.
Yet the quarterly US current-account deficit actually increased – from $195 billion to $205 billion.
American companies cannot compete with these countries either.
All those problems contribute to the imbalance, and China should fix them.
By any moral standard, that goal is at least as important as anything on America’s agenda.
But how serious was the threat? In reality, China’s devaluation was puny – by the end of the week, less than 5% in all.
But the second criterion – that the currency must be “freely usable” (widely used and widely traded) – has proved to be a major stumbling block.
But the IMF has certainly noticed, suggesting that “a more market-determined exchange rate would facilitate SDR operations, in case the renminbi were included in the currency basket going forward.”
It would also be highly problematic for the global economy.
Unsurprisingly, this has exacerbated the fear of deflation, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising by just 0.8% year on year in January, and the annual decline in producer prices steepening, to 4.3%.
Given that current circumstances are far less threatening than those in the depths of the Great Crisis, the need for another tactical adjustment in currency policy is far less acute.
Strategy is China's greatest strength.
Nonetheless, adding the renminbi to the SDR basket would be symbolically important, implying recognition of China’s growing global stature.
Per Zhou’s proposal, China has championed a transition to a multi-currency reserve system, in which the SDR and an internationalized renminbi would be used more widely, including in countries’ currency reserves.
Of course, China stands to gain much from the renminbi’s emergence as an alternative international reserve currency, sharing in the “exorbitant privilege” that the US currently enjoys by virtue of the dollar’s global status.
History suggests that a shift in global currency dominance is likely to occur gradually.
No doubt, China has made remarkable progress over a relatively short period.
In short, unlike the rest of the currencies in the SDR basket, the renminbi is an international currency in the making, just as China is an economic and financial power in the making.
This goal certainly seems attainable.
In fact, given the SDR’s very limited role in the global economy, the move will have few concrete effects in the short term.
By moving away from the renminbi peg to the US dollar – an undoubtedly risky move – China demonstrated its willingness to allow market forces to establish the exchange rate in the long term.
By demonstrating its confidence in the renminbi’s continued rise, the IMF has reinforced global expectations of – and lent implicit support to – the renminbi’s progress toward internationalization. Whatever challenges China faces, its steady march to the forefront of the global economy is set to continue.
America’s failure to deal with its internal challenges would come at a steep price.
The US is also an invaluable source of ideas.
It is not just that the US lacks the means; the very nature of contemporary global problems suggests that only collective responses stand a good chance of succeeding.
Much of this was due to an export-led industrialization and urbanization strategy that opened up new opportunities in the rapidly expanding cities, where labor, capital, technology, and infrastructure came together to form supply capacities for global markets.
Indeed, contrary to popular belief outside China, the Chinese state is not monolithic; it is a highly complex bureaucracy with many layers of government and quasi-government institutions that do not always conform to central directives.
Compared to the private sector, local governments and state-owned enterprises tend to have access to significantly cheaper funding, with the gap between official interest rates and shadow-banking borrowing costs reaching as much as ten percentage points.
NEW YORK – As the United States struggles to understand last September’s attack on its diplomatic mission in Benghazi, which took the lives of four Americans, including US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, a formal investigation has not even been opened in Libya – and likely never will be.
But it is a crucial step toward establishing order and enhancing the newly elected government’s legitimacy.
Moreover, the military receives inadequate financing, with officers forced to use their personal funds to purchase gas for military vehicles.
For example, in June, Defense Minister Osama al-Juwali attacked the NTC for failing to consult with the appropriate officials on its decisions, stating that his role had been reduced to “signing the plans of the chief of staff.”
After years of negotiation and numerous scientific-assessment reports, delegations had the highest expectations for concluding a comprehensive climate treaty.
Given that the UN formally accepted the 2°C limit as the starting point for the top-down approach in 2010, the well-practiced strategy of obscuring current failures by announcing more ambitious future efforts would become unsustainable.
In order to ensure this outcome, the EU must begin preparing a Plan B that accounts for the coming climate-policy paradigm shift.
Now, suddenly, everyone has discovered that the US economy is doing well – so well that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has switched from blaming Obama for a bad economy to demanding credit for a good one.
The mystery, until recently, was why economic performance had been so weak.
(According to one measure, the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis and the 2013 government shutdown caused uncertainty comparable to that sparked by the September 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.)
The irony is that rising inequality is usually thought to play to the Democrats’ electoral advantage.
In politics, too, Yushchenko is playing with fire, having lost the support of most of “Our Ukraine,” the party he created.
Moreover, he seemed genuinely committed to reconciliation between Ukraine’s Russian-speaking east and Ukrainian-speaking west.
Given that Yushchenko has almost no chance of winning the next presidential election, Tymoshenko has made him a generous offer.
In fact, Abbas does not even control the militias of his own party, Fatah, which have been even more active than Hamas in staging terrorist attacks against Israel.
Locked in a self-imposed conceptual paralysis that does not allow for a non-military solution, Israel refuses to see that Hamas’s rocket attacks on Israeli territory are not intended to draw Israel into an invasion. Instead, they are an attempt to establish a new deterrent against Israel that would force it to agree to a cease-fire ( Tahdiye) .
A Palestinian national unity government would not impede a settlement for the simple reason that the moderates now negotiating with Israel must in any case strive for an agreement that the extremists could not label as a treacherous sell-out.
The NPT regime stands on three pillars: non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Today, the challenges posed by proliferation are more complex than ever:
For example, some countries want to develop smaller and "usable" nuclear weapons designed for pre-emptive or preventive military action. Many non-nuclear weapon states, particularly those from the developing world, remain frustrated with the fact that peaceful nuclear cooperation is yet to be fully realized.
If we are serious about saving the non-proliferation regime, the time to act is now.
Yemen ’s central problems are two: the ongoing civil war that the government is waging against the Houthi tribe in the country’s north, and the suppression of a secessionist movement in the south.
Saleh will undoubtedly resist such an effort.
And it is not just the Yemeni state that is at fault.
So, instead of exporting religious radicalism to Yemen, importing its manpower could neutralize Yemen’s problems.
First, as with all systems that preceded it, it puts the burden of adjustment on deficit countries, not on surplus countries.
One basic reason is that the only “collective insurance” available is limited and highly conditional IMF lending.
The IMF took steps in this direction in March, particularly by creating the Flexible Credit Line for crisis-prevention purposes, as well as expanding other credit lines and overhauling conditionality (relying more on ex-ante conditionality and eliminating structural performance criteria).
Today, popular rebellion and political change have spread throughout the region.
Had the treaty been approved in 2005 as intended, it would have been in place for six years, and the strain placed by the crisis on EU economic governance – so visible in the eurozone’s recent problems – would have been much more manageable.
And, politically, Turkey has emerged as a regional leader, a role that it takes extremely seriously.
The EU now accounts for 75% of foreign investment in Turkey and roughly half its exports and inward tourism.
And we said: Turkey will be an EU member.
Most studies of supply chains examine their operations, but take for granted governments’ critical enabling role.
Recognizing the need for systemic change, China allowed local governments in special economic zones and cities to experiment with modern legal, administrative, and logistical practices for export industries, including investments in utilities and transport.
The critical mechanism for orchestrating and implementing the complex web of contracts embodied in China’s government-services supply chain is the Five-Year Plan, which foresees vertical and horizontal integration of almost all Party and administrative agencies.
Adapting the governance metric in a country of China’s size to an economy that is green, inclusive, and equitable presents a novel challenge in human history.
With foreign direct investment still flowing in, Brazil’s lower external vulnerability leaves the country in a much better position than ever before to weather the global storm – at least for now.
But Brazil’s financial markets are much more sensitive than trade to international disturbances, and monetary flows could decrease in the long term.
Beyond that, one can only hope that current external economic disturbances do not lead to a global disaster.
What is astonishing about this “model” is that it has enabled China to maintain rapid growth within a relatively stable political environment for 30 years.
But the “China model” has given the authorities the tools to avoid such an outcome.
Most forecasts suggest that, with a huge effort, China can maintain 8% growth in 2009.
This is quite a turnabout for an economy that for years had crept along at what was derisively called the “Hindu rate of growth” – around 3% – while much of the rest of Asia shot ahead.
Instead, the decline in Indian stocks reflected foreign investors’ liquidity problems: they withdrew from holdings in India because they needed their money back home, not because it wasn’t growing for them.
Obviously, the terrorist attacks of late November complicate this story.
According to the World Bank’s annual assessment of Global Economic Prospects, India’s economy could even triple in size in the next 15 to 20 years.
Globally, however, solar and wind are only a small part of total renewables – less than 7% in 2010. Hydropower is a much bigger player, at 17%.
The climate effect could be a net increase in emissions if forests are cleared to create energy-crop plantations.
For example, burning a hectare of harvested willow on a field previously used for barley (the typical marginal crop in Denmark) prevents 30 tons of CO2 annually when replacing coal.
Germany alone spends more than $3 billion annually, or $167 per ton of avoided CO2 emissions, which is more than 37 times the cost of carbon reductions in the European Union Emissions Trading System.
The World’s North Korean Test
There are some who would urge that we all remain calm (good advice in most circumstances) and somehow take comfort in the fact that North Korea still faces many serious technical hurdles before it can successfully add nuclear weapons to its considerable conventional arsenal.
One thing we know about the North Koreans is that, unless they can use such rhetoric in their own propaganda (they got far more traction out of former US President George W. Bush’s infamous “axis of evil” remark than he ever did), they simply don’t care what is said about them.
There are also those – a dwindling minority, fortunately – who continue to suggest that more needs to be done on the negotiating track.
As it stands, many pundits see little promise for R2P, foreseeing instead an intensifying deadlock between Western interventionists and non-Western stalwarts of sovereignty.
Consider the South African and Tanzanian troops using military force, under a Brazilian commander, to fight armed groups in the Congo, and the many African statesmen whose efforts have been central in mediation attempts across the continent.
Second, policymakers, academics, and activists around the world need to address the question of how to protect effectively.
What the British did for us, the extraordinary generosity they showed refugees like me during those difficult war years, stood out.
One recalls the reluctance on the part of the Dutch and the Belgians even to issue transit visas to refugees like me attempting to reach England from Germany during World War II, for fear that we would remain in their countries.
Meanwhile, wealthy countries like the United States, Canada, and the Gulf monarchies have largely closed their doors to the refugees, just as the US closed its doors to all but a tiny number of the Jews fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe.
The least the rest of us can do is welcome them.
All too often, notions such as “reserve agricultural land,” or “idle land,” are manipulated out of existence, sometimes being used to designate land on which many livelihoods depend, and that is subject to long-standing customary rights.
The underlying problem runs deeper than how the principles have been formulated.
But they also create a number of social costs that are not accounted for in the market price of their output.
To re-launch agriculture in the developing world would require an estimated $30 billion per year, representing 0.05% of global GDP.
The Turkish government, unwisely, became embroiled with the EU over its plan to extend the customs union to include all new member states, including Cyprus.
Some argue that it would be better to leave Cyprus alone and revisit the problem only in the closing stages of Turkey’s EU accession.
Given the island’s complexity, and Cypriot sensitivity, it would be foolish for an outsider to try to sketch any future settlement.
While the EU must be present, it cannot be a neutral mediator, since Greece and Cyprus are both members.
Likewise, in his second inaugural address, US President Barack Obama discussed climate change more than any other issue, saying, “We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries.”
But other, less widely discussed factors must be considered –&#160;particularly the costs of delayed action on climate change. For example, Unilever CEO Paul Polman reported that extreme weather cost his company $250-300 million in 2012.
And, given rising global demand for oil, particularly in developing countries, energy-import prices will remain high.
By maintaining high environmental standards, and promoting such standards among its trade partners, Europe can bolster the global market for clean-energy technologies.
And, by 2040, India’s population will have reached 1.6 billion, surpassing China’s, which will have stagnated a decade earlier.
As other advanced economies become increasingly services-based, the US is reindustrializing.
But implementing the eight policy proposals would also widen further the wealth gap between the US and Europe, which has been growing for the last three decades. In 1980-2005, the US economy grew by a factor of 4.45 – a level that no major European economy even approached.
And conditions in Africa and Latin America are generally stabilizing.
Washington Consensus reforms – including macroeconomic stabilization (defined as low-single-digit inflation) and market liberalization – were supposed to reduce poverty by accelerating economic growth.
The UN encourages governments to assume a more proactive development role, which would entail an integrated policymaking approach aimed at promoting structural change while reducing inequality, vulnerability, and economic insecurity.
But, in general, universal social policies have been much more effective and politically sustainable, while policies targeting the poor, or the “poorest of the poor,” have often been costly and neglectful of many of those in need.
सन् 1945 से खाद्य उत्पादन तीन गुना बढ़ा है. प्रति व्यक्‍ति खाद्य उपलब्‍धता भी औसतन 40% बढ़ी है. केवल पिछले एक दशक में एशिया-प्रशांत क्षेत्र में सब्जियों का उत्पादन एक-चौथाई बढ़ा है. इस क्षेत्र में दुनिया की तीन-चौथाई सब्जियां उगाई जाती हैं.

बेहतर पोषण की आर्थिक मंशा भी है. अपने सभी स्वरूपों में कुपोषण कम उत्पादन व अतिरिक्‍त खर्चों के कारण हर साल वैश्‍विक आर्थिक कल्याण में लगभग 5% की कमी लाता है. अनुमान है कि सूक्ष्मपोषण कमियों को दूर करने से मिले आर्थिक लाभों से लागत/लाभ अनुपात लगभग 1:13 तक बढ़ जाता है. यानी लागत से 13 गुना ज्यादा लाभ मिलता है.
And, from the 1990s on, globalization – in particular, China’s integration into the world economy – has probably been the main reason for the decline in global inflationary pressure.
Given this, targeting consumer prices in the next 2-3 years will not guarantee that the value of money remains stable in the long term.
Central banks’ exclusive focus on consumer prices may even be counterproductive.
Temporary fluctuations in a narrow and imprecisely measured CPI are a small price to pay to secure the long-term stability of money.
With the 1995 Social Summit adopting a wider definition of poverty that includes deprivation, social exclusion, and lack of participation, the situation today may be even worse than suggested by a money-income poverty line.
In addition, new and potentially viable production capacities need to be fostered through complementary developmental policies.
This is not to deny some positive consequences.
There will be no real poverty eradication without equitable and sustainable economic development, which deregulated markets have proved unable to deliver on their own.
This is already taking place in the trade realm.
This was demonstrated by the American and world reaction to terrorism.
If a state fails to live up to its side of the bargain by sponsoring terrorism, either transferring or using weapons of mass destruction, or conducting genocide, then it forfeits the normal benefits of sovereignty and opens itself up to attack, removal, or occupation.
They created tests that can establish a person’s HIV status or gauge the disease’s progression.
Across Africa, the disease is estimated to have reduced average national growth rates by 2-4 percentage points a year.
“It is very hard to take the antiretroviral drugs without having any food in the stomach and when I am worrying about where I am going to live,” she said.
Thirty years after the discovery of HIV/AIDS, we have seen impressive scientific and policy advances.
There are reports that, behind the scenes, things are different.
He has just over a year-and-a-half to go to complete his second and final five-year term as South Africa’s president.
The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 was probably the last masterpiece of Franco-German creativity.
The election a year ago of French President Nicolas Sarkozy might have promised a new era of cooperation.
But the larger geo-strategic questions, such as the EU’s relations with Russia and its links to NATO, require the attention of a larger leadership team, including Eastern European countries.
The Return of the Ugly German
In terms of foreign policy, Germany rebuilt trust by embracing Western integration and Europeanization.
One wonders whether Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble knew what they were doing.
But the massive conflict with France and Italy, the eurozone’s second and third largest economies, is not over, because, for Schäuble, Grexit remains an option.
The foundation of the second, unified German nation-state in 1989 was based on Germany’s irrevocable Western orientation and Europeanization.
Crises like those we have recently endured were initially driven by excessive debt and leverage among private-sector agents – households, banks and financial institutions, corporate firms.
And, of course, such weekend dramas are still with us, as EU and eurozone policymakers recently spent a desperate weekend developing a rescue package not only for Greece, but also for other weak eurozone members.
Political gridlock in Washington and in the United States Congress demonstrates the absence of the bipartisanship needed to address America’s fiscal issues.
The European Central Bank managed to relieve an incipient credit crunch through its long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), which lent over a trillion euros to eurozone banks at one percent.
The Bundesbank has become aware of the danger.
Other countries have gone through similar experiences.
To be realistic, the current fiscal compact governing the eurozone must be taken as the starting point.
A Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) owning the rights could use the ECB to finance the cost of acquiring the bonds without violating Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty.
This was ultimately achieved, but only after President Anwar Sadat embraced a strategy of peace by journeying to Jerusalem. The most ominous case, however, was Germany in the 1930s, which systematically shredded the European order that had emerged after World War I.
While neither option is particularly appealing, the dangers of a war with Russia cannot be overestimated.
If Putin's dangerous brinkmanship is to be stopped, Western leaders will need to find a way to initiate strategic cooperation with Russia. Specifically, they must devise a grand bargain for peace that addresses the fundamental questions relating to global security norms and arms control that have so far impeded such cooperation.
Some countries – like the United Kingdom and Australia – went so far as to unbundle these functions by assigning responsibility for financial stability to specialized agencies and extricating their central banks from financial supervisory issues altogether.
It is now increasingly recognized that significant asset-price increases (for example, in real estate or existing equities) may well be reinforced by the pro-cyclical nature of risk assessment embodied in those rules.
Capital buffers to absorb losses during the downturn of the cycle can be more easily built during the upswing.
The so-called “Miracle on the Han River” took root with the reforms initiated by Park’s late father Park Chung-hee, the country’s ruler for much of the 1960’s and 1970’s.
Employment at the country’s largest companies is falling, and the share of South Korean jobs at such companies has dropped by one-third since 1995.
Without action, the economy faces the threat of declining consumption and even shrinking output.
Aggressive development of services – such as transport, retail, and restaurants, which today are dominated by low-productivity, low-paying local businesses, many run by sole proprietors – is another imperative.
The task is no less than to achieve South Korea’s second miracle on the Han River.
Only ten universities from the entire EU have ever made it into the top 50. Germany’s top university, Heidelberg, ranks 58th.
But the EU and European governments must do more.
But just throwing money at universities isn’t enough.
However fierce the global competition, they should concentrate on safeguarding quality and achieving excellence in research and education.
She returned to Bangladesh from exile, which the army had imposed on her.  After her return she still had to endure imprisonment and trumped-up murder charges.
The example of Hamas and Hezbollah provide a salutary reminder of the challenges faced by the new government in Bangladesh.
Bangladesh is a country rich with human potential, but that potential can only be realized by making poor people’s needs – which Islamists around the world have previously made their own political territory – the new government’s top priority.
The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index in the United States, begun in 1967, fell in October to its lowest value ever.
Animal spirits are not always shattered by extraordinary economic events.
The stunning magnitude of recent declines cannot be dismissed as a one-day anomaly caused by a technical trading glitch.
Perhaps the saving grace in this situation is that animal spirits can and sometimes do change direction.
Some measures – Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 and from the Gaza Strip in 2005, or Hamas’ year-long ceasefire – might be seen as constructive.
Syria, however, cannot be ignored, since it is capable of undermining attempts at reaching an Israeli-Palestinian track or stabilizing Lebanon.
The Syrian government itself has realized that it must demonstrate its willingness for dialogue by offering Israel unconditional negotiations, receiving the Iraqi and Palestinian presidents for talks in Damascus, and supporting intra-Palestinian talks. But it has yet to send convincing and reassuring signals towards Lebanon.
According to its program, the government will respect all agreements signed by the PLO.
A Europe of Solidarity, Not Only Discipline
Call this the tragedy of the European Union.
That is not conducive to a harmonious partnership.
Wallenberg was a hero who saved the lives of many Jews in my home city of Budapest by establishing Swedish safe houses.
Some 60,000 refugees who sought to register have been put into detention facilities where conditions are inhumane.
As soon as possible, I will dispatch an OSIFE needs-assessment team to Greece to contact the authorities – and the people and organizations already helping the needy – to work out a plan for which we can generate public support.
Burma is a deeply religious country, where most men spend some time as Buddhist monks.
Many political dissidents in South Korea were inspired by their Christian beliefs, and the same is true in China.
Men and women who found strength in their belief in Communism resisted the Nazis with equal tenacity.
Liberals are most needed when compromises have to be made, but not nearly as useful when faced with brute force.
So, whichever side gains the upper hand, authoritarianism and economic stagnation will prevail once again.
Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Tunisia, and soon perhaps other countries in the region will serve as fertile grounds for a new, more militarily oriented Al Qaeda, which will become a more powerful factor in the Middle East’s cacophony of interests and ideologies.
Withdrawal is one of the riskiest military maneuvers, because it can easily degenerate into panicky retreat and chaos.
So, when the Islamist revolution does return, it is likely to be even more powerful and violent.
Concerned that the Arab rebellions would radicalize their own repressed minorities, they refuse to allow the UN Security Council to be used to promote revolutionary changes in the Arab world.
Each case has elicited a different response, owing either to the constraints of international power politics, as is now the case with respect to Syria, or to economic and strategic considerations, as in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.
Since its victory in the Cold War, America’s hegemony in the Middle East has been a story of frustration and unrewarded investment of blood, sweat, and treasure.
Revolutionary Shadows
I assumed that I was supposed to be provoked into unguarded comments, a method that fashionable TV journalists everywhere use nowadays.
Revitalization of the extreme right in Hungary and the rise of “National Bolshevism” in Russia, where Tolstoy is now re-condemned by the Orthodox Church as a proto-communist, suggest a deeper and more pervasive atavistic longing.
For far different reasons, the US, and the entire world, seems condemned to simplification of thought, action, and feeling in the service of immediate, quotidian efficiency.
But the resulting economic inaction would be just as damaging to the consolidation of democratic rule.
In Tunisia, too, the budget deficit has widened sharply in the wake of the revolution, rising from 2.6% of GDP in 2010 to 6% in 2011.
Economic weakness thus provides an unprecedented opportunity for international engagement with the new Arab leadership, which should incorporate short-, medium-, and long-term goals.
Only a combination of these options would allow Arab economies to create jobs in the short term, while avoiding the risks of destabilizing fiscal imbalances or a lack of financing for private-sector investment.

इस उदाहरण का सबक यह है कि कच्चे माल का मूल्य संवर्द्धन विविधीकरण का एक मार्ग है, पर जरूरी नहीं कि यह लंबा हो या हमेशा फलदायी रहे. देश अपने यहां उपलब्ध कच्चे माल तक ही सीमित नहीं है. आखिर स्विट्जरलैंड के पास कोको नहीं है और चीन उन्नत मेमोरी चिप नहीं बनाता है. लेकिन इससे इन देशों को क्रमशः चाकलेट और कंप्यूटर के बाजार में अपना दबदबा कायम करने में कोई बाधा नहीं उत्पन्न हुई.
इसके विपरीत पेट्रोकेमिकल या इस्पात संयंत्रों का विकास अथवा कम वेतन वाले हीरा-काटने के कार्यों को भारत या विएतनाम से बोत्सवाना - एक ऐसा देश जो चार गुना से ज्यादा अमीर है - ले जाना जितना अकल्पनाशील है उतना ही सीमितकारी भी है. यूएई में कहीं अधिक रचनाशीलता पाई जा सकती है जिसने तेल से होने वाली आमदनी का अब संरचना तथा सुविधाओं में निवेश किया है. इसके परिणामस्वरूप दुबई आज सफल पर्यटन व व्यापारिक केंद्र में तब्दील हो चुका है.
Venezuela’s government needs to pay $5.2 billion in the first days of October.
He was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and had to launch a social-media campaign to locate the drugs that his treatment required.
Venezuela has defaulted on PDVSA’s suppliers, contractors, and joint-venture partners, causing oil exports to fall by 45% relative to 1997 and production to amount to about half what the 2005 plan had projected for 2012.
Bondholders would be wise to exchange their current bonds for longer-dated instruments that would benefit from the upturn.
The ultimate reason for such self-destructiveness may be impossible to identify. But it is certainly possible to describe how the road to hell is paved, whatever the intentions.
But controls lead to a parallel exchange rate, which can be either legal, as in Argentina, or illegal and even unpublishable, as in Venezuela.
Eventually, a major adjustment of the official rate becomes inevitable.

पूँजी की दूसरी रोचक विशेषता यह है कि यह बचतों के ज़रिए जमा होती है। कोई व्यक्ति या देश जो आय की 100 इकाई बचाता है, उसे शाश्वत रूप से लगभग 4-5 इकाई वार्षिक आय प्राप्त करने में स��्षम होना चाहिए। यहाँ से, यह देखना आसान है कि अगर पूँजी का पूरी तरह पुनः निवेश किया जाता है और अर्थव्यवस्था में 4-5% से कम की वृद्धि होती है, तो पूँजी और इसका आय का अंश अर्थव्यवस्था में तुलनात्मक रूप से बड़ा हो जाएगा।

यह क्या चल रहा है? आसान सा जवाब यह है कि चीज़़ें सिर्फ़ पूँजी और श्रम से नहीं बनाई जातीं, जैसा कि पिकेटी का तर्क है। उनमें तकनीकी ज्ञान भी शामिल होता है।
The Tacit-Knowledge Economy

Why is it that today’s smaller and more educated urbanized families in emerging-market economies are so much less productive than their counterparts were a half-century ago in today’s rich countries? Why can’t today’s emerging markets replicate levels of productivity that were achieved in countries with worse social indicators and much older technologies?
How do they create and mobilize coherent teams of people in new economic activities if the requisite tacit knowledge is missing?
The US would not have been able to build the first atomic bomb in just four years had Hitler not encouraged so many key scientists to leave Europe.
Instead, the brain is a giant hierarchical memory that is constantly recording what it perceives and predicting what will come next.
The process involves adding and combining new and existing capabilities to support more diverse and complex activities.
In a particular city or country, you can predict, even a decade in advance, which industries will appear or disappear or grow or wane just by knowing the history of what has been there and everywhere else.
We should seize this opportunity.
The poor are poor because they are victims of the powerful.
Once upon a time, in ancient Mesopotamia, oil was known to exist and it was peddled by some quacks for its medicinal powers.
They did, however, have the right to restrict access to their underground resources in order to extract rents, just as the despised agricultural landowners have done for centuries.
They are also home to thousands of new companies, many of which are quickly becoming large, global leaders in their fields.
The top 20 host cities are home to around one-third of all large companies’ headquarters and account for almost half of these companies’ combined revenue.
Those who have been writing obituaries for the emerging-market boom should give serious consideration to these trends.
They need to prepare.
Foreign investors’ purchases of emerging-market sovereign and corporate bonds almost tripled from 2009 to 2012, reaching $264 billion.
The situation is particularly difficult in some European countries.
Economic activity and business profits would have been lower, and government deficits would have been higher.
Like Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, the Islamic State appears to understand the impact that lurid images of violence can have on the public imagination.
Consider, for example, how Indonesia’s Suharto regime, from 1966 to 1998, depicted alleged Communist insurgent savagery, and compelled citizens to watch it on television and in theaters.
That is why exorcising its demons will require more than military might.
Trade has been tariff-free for decades: the big impact has come from reducing non-tariff barriers arising from different national regulations. A British-made car can now be sold anywhere in the EU without having to comply with 28 member states’ safety and emissions standards.
So much for dry analysis. If you want to know what all of this means in practice, pay attention to recent statements from Diageo, the world’s largest producer of Scotch whisky.
The loss of life is devastating, and millions are rendered homeless.
Three and a half years after the dawn of the “Arab Spring,” there is a real possibility that we are witnessing the early phase of a prolonged, costly, and deadly struggle; as bad as things are, they could well become worse.
Regime change in Libya has created a failing state; lukewarm support for regime change in Syria has set the stage for prolonged civil war.
Economic assistance should go simultaneously to Jordan and Lebanon to help them cope with the flood of refugees.
Likewise, diplomacy can work in Syria only if it accepts the reality on the ground (including the survival of the Assad regime for the foreseeable future), rather than seeking to transform it.
But these objectives – including improvement of market access in agriculture, manufacturing, and services; clarification of international trade rules; and progress on addressing relevant environmental issues – were overly ambitious.
This triggered vehement protests – and strong retaliation – from America’s trading partners.
Of course, protectionist pressures have occasionally arisen since then.
African countries have plenty of experience with the downsides of major resource endowments. Kenya must learn from these cases, in order to prevent its new oil riches from tripping up East Africa in its headlong dash toward monetary union.
Of course, like any marathon, it is best not to start too fast.
If East Africa’s central bank raises interest rates to stave off inflation in Kenya, the rest of the union will experience increased unemployment.
At the beach where I surfed today, I heard about a ceremony that had taken place there earlier in the season – a farewell to a local surfer who had died at a ripe old age.
Tennis fans may admire a well-executed backhand; but watching players warm up on court would soon become dull if no match followed.
Many of the highlights of my surfing have more to do with experiencing the splendor and power of the waves than with my ability to ride them.
The price of divergence could be steep: though the worst is over, effective coordination of policy is still needed at a time when rebalancing the global economy, as the G-20 has called for, is far from being accomplished.
Emerging-market countries could also invest in euros, if only they were offered such liquid assets as US Treasury bonds – therein lies the current debate over the proposed creation of “eurobonds.”
And, because tax revenues, too, will not recover, the gap will have to be bridged by fiscal austerity.
We are neighbors, our histories and populations intertwined.
Terror and barbarity have been globalized, too.
It will play into the hands of the terrorists.
But we must also face up to the fact that we will not defeat ISIS without a bigger, more effective, and better coordinated military effort.
To his credit, British Prime Minister David Cameron clearly understands the importance of increasing the military pressure on ISIS; he had been held back by a head-under-the-blanket faction in his own Conservative Party and in Parliament as a whole.
TOKYO – At its 15th session, which ended at the beginning of October, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution encouraging governments to eliminate discrimination against people affected by leprosy – and their family members.
Unchecked, leprosy disfigures and can result in permanent disability.
The first dose of MDT kills 99.9% of the bacteria that cause leprosy, rendering the person no longer infectious.
People who have been infected with leprosy also are entitled to the same rights as everyone else with respect to full citizenship and obtaining identify documents.
A woman with short-term memory loss broke into a big smile, the company reported, when the robot asked her, “Would you like a bowl of ice cream?”
What will it do to a child, he asks, to spend a lot of time with a machine that cannot express genuine empathy, understanding, or compassion?
For the moment, a more realistic concern is not that robots will harm us, but that we will harm them.
Rio’s Unsustainable Nonsense
But the latter are “technical” and gain from standardization; the former are not and must reflect variety instead.
At what cost?
That can only come through access to education and economic opportunity, both in poor and rich countries.
A new marriage law, for example, requires interfaith couples to register their intent to marry with local authorities, who will display a public notice of the engagement; only if no citizen objects to the union – highly unlikely in the present tense climate – is the couple permitted to wed.
By stoking Buddhist violence against the Rohingya, the regime aims to damage Suu Kyi and the NLD’s chances of victory in two ways.
But the former president is now mounting a furious comeback bid and might well win the parliamentary election scheduled for August 17.
And in St. Petersberg in July 2006, the G-8 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the ambitious goals they had set the year before, although they did not go further.
I have also seen the need for ordinary Africans to embrace a set of values, like service for the common good, and commitment, persistence, and patience until a goal is realized.
In the course of my work over the past 30 years, I have observed that whether it is at the national or regional level, most conflicts are over resources. Who will control and utilize them?
They must also be empowered with knowledge, skills, and tools to take action.
A Year on the Brink
The US, with Obama re-elected, is likely to muddle on, much as it has for the past four years.&#160; Inklings of recovery in the real-estate market will be enough to discourage dramatic policy measures, like a write-down of principal on “underwater” mortgages (where the outstanding loan exceeds the market value of the house).
While European leaders have repeatedly done what previously seemed unthinkable, their responses have been out of synch with markets.
Banks have been saved, but the underlying problems were left to fester – no surprise there, given that, in both Europe and America, the task of fixing them was assigned to the policymakers who had caused them.
But switching locomotives is never free of risk.
As long as appropriate governance and revenue-administration mechanisms are put in place – particularly to avoid rent-seeking behavior – natural-resource availability may turn out to be a blessing rather than a curse for these countries.
But our point is that powerful forces that drive up asset prices may be unleashed even without massive liquidity inflows.
LONDON – Mainstream economics subscribes to the theory that markets “clear” continuously.
An economy hit by a shock does not maintain its buoyancy; rather, it becomes a leaky balloon.
Most disappointing to reformers has been the official rejection of the “Glass-Steagall” approach to banking reform.
The underlying problem, though, is that both regulators and bankers continue to rely on mathematical models that promise more than they can deliver for managing financial risks.
Gordon argues that the major technological changes that raised the standard of living in the past are much more important than anything that can happen in the future.
Moreover, because the US government does not count anything in GDP unless it is sold in the market, the vast expansion of television entertainment and the introduction of services like Google and Facebook have been completely excluded from the national account.
If real incomes grow at just 1.5% a year, the median income 30 years from now will be nearly 60% higher than the income of today’s median-income individual.
NEW HAVEN – If we have learned anything since the global financial crisis peaked in 2008, it is that preventing another one is a tougher job than most people anticipated.
In a paper presented at the session, Andrew Caplin of New York University spoke of the public’s lack of interest or comprehension of the rising risks associated with the FHA, which has been guaranteeing privately-issued mortgages since its creation during the housing crisis of the 1930’s.
Why not, I asked?
In trying to balance such considerations, the government is in over its head.
These popular, emotionally relevant narratives sometimes inspire us to go out and spend, start businesses, build new factories and office buildings, and hire employees; at other times, they put fear in our hearts and impel us to sit tight, save our resources, curtail spending, and reduce risk.
Ever since 2009, most of us have just been waiting for some story to turn our hearts aglow with hope and confidence – and to reinvigorate our economies.
Then the financial crisis erupted, scaring the entire world.
This ought to be a confidence-boosting story: amazing technologies are emerging, sales are booming, and entrepreneurship is alive and very well.
Nationalism, after all, is intrinsically bound up with individual identity.
International agencies recently issued warnings about speculative excesses in asset markets, suggesting that we should be worried about a possible crisis.
The International Monetary Fund announced in June a new Global Housing Watch website that tracks global home prices and ratios.
In fact, we have had only three salient global crises in the last century: 1929-33, 1980-82, and 2007-9.
NEW HAVEN – The depression that followed the stock-market crash of 1929 took a turn for the worse eight years later, and recovery came only with the enormous economic stimulus provided by World War II, a conflict that cost more than 60 million lives.
That name is the “new normal,” referring to long-term diminished prospects for economic growth, a term popularized by Bill Gross, a founder of bond giant PIMCO.
“Secular stagnation” and “underconsumptionism” are terms that betray an underlying pessimism, which, by discouraging spending, not only reinforces a weak economy, but also generates anger, intolerance, and a potential for violence.
According to Friedman, “Obviously nothing can enable the majority of the population to be better off than everyone else.
One problem with economics is that it is necessarily focused on policy, rather than discovery of fundamentals.
Why is it called a prize in “economic sciences,” rather than just “economics”? The other prizes are not awarded in the “chemical sciences” or the “physical sciences.”
Similarly, the terms astronomical science and hypnotic science mostly died out as the twentieth century progressed, perhaps because belief in the occult waned in respectable society.
They even have neuroses and identity problems, complex phenomena that the field of behavioral economics is finding relevant to understanding economic outcomes.
Jindal’s response reflects an ongoing – and potentially catastrophic – shift away from science-based policymaking.
And, despite the absence of evidence that mobile phones pose any kind of danger, former Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich, alleging that officials were suppressing information, introduced the “Cell Phone Right to Know Act” to require radiation warnings on the devices.
But when deciding collectively on how to confront an approaching tornado, there is an indisputable shared goal, and ignoring the experts would be wholly irrational.
The Road to Full Investment
True enough, interest rates were falling, though not as fast as the fall in expected profit on new investment.
Those who know their history will recognize that Summers is reviving an argument advanced by the American economist Alvin Hansen in 1938.
This mixture of stimulating events and policies enabled Western economies to maintain high investment ratios in the post-WWII years.
And one can think of many others.
Endgame for Putin in Ukraine?
The BRICS’ “no strings” policy explicitly challenges the conditionality imposed on borrowers by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, though the policy remains untested.
It retains a formidable nuclear capacity, but it is inconceivable that Russia would use it to secure its aims in Ukraine.
It is natural and right to think of possible compromises: Ukraine’s guaranteed neutrality, greater regional autonomy within a federal Ukraine, an interim international administration in Crimea to supervise a referendum on its future, and the like.
Putin’s power elite will start fracturing – indeed, that process may have begun already.
Particularly important is the growing discontent of economics students with the university curriculum.
The same can be said of the history of the discipline.”
Unfortunately, such assumptions have a profound influence on policy.
Publication in such journals is also the basis of promotion.
LONDON – The developed world is slowly emerging from the Great Recession, but a question lingers: How fast and how far will the recovery go? One big source of pessimism has been the idea that we are running out of investment opportunities – and have been since before the 2008 crash.
Unconventional monetary policies like quantitative easing may inflate a new generation of asset bubbles, but the underlying problem – negative returns to new investment – will not have been solved by the time the next crash comes.
You can produce the result just as well by consuming more or working less.
As a result, the share of shale gas in America’s overall gas production rose from just 5% in 2007 to 36% in 2012.
But it does seem to me that contemporary apostles of secular stagnation like Summers and Paul Krugman at least ought to be taking the shale-energy revolution into account.
These measures restored peace.
There would, of course, be some temporary unemployment in the technologically advancing sectors; but, in the long run, machine-assisted production, by increasing the real wealth of the community, would enable full employment at higher wages.
As machines become ever more productive, so wages tend to fall even more, toward zero, and the population becomes redundant.
The prospect of the “abridgment of labor” should fill us with hope rather than foreboding.
But, whichever way the vote goes, the spectacular rise of nationalism, in Scotland and elsewhere in Europe, is a symptom of a diseased political mainstream.
That is why Britain has spawned two nationalisms simultaneously.
It would inherit its share of UK public-sector debt and future liabilities without the benefit of the substantial subsidy that it currently receives from the British Treasury.
And a Scottish currency that floats against the British pound would mean large transaction costs and reduced trade between the two countries.
Free Trade and Costly Love
Economists regard understanding the theory of comparative advantage as a test of professional competence.
The economist responds that the more efficient you are at your work, the more time you will have for those other things.
As Wolfers explains,
At that point, we must admit that it is irrational to spend time on long conversations with friends if it is time stolen from inventing, say, new software (unless the conversation helps the invention).
Simply put, populists seldom build a healthy economy.
Essential goods are in short supply.
The crisis for populist governments arises when those vital resources are depleted or demand for them falls. Either way, as the resources boom diminishes, populist regimes lose their legitimacy, because voters still expect to receive handouts.
As the virtual world expands, so, too, do breaches of trust and misuse of personal data.
But too much control would almost certainly stifle innovation, increase costs, and probably exclude important anti-establishment voices.
(Indeed, in a world of human-robot interfaces, 3D printing, nanotechnology, and shale-gas extraction, any innovative company must ask itself this basic question.)
वाशिंगटन, डीसी – उभरते और विकासशील देशों में किफ़ायती दवाओं तक पहुँच के बारे में होनेवाली चर्चा में अक्सर एक महत्वपूर्ण मुद्दे को अनदेखा कर दिया जाता है: इन देशों में सरकारें नेमी तौर पर जीवन के लिए महत्वपूर्ण दवाओं पर शुल्क और अन्य कर थोप देती हैं। हालाँकि इन उपायों से सामान्य राजस्व की प्राप्ति तो होती है, परंतु इनसे प्रभावित दवाएँ अधिक महँगी हो जाती हैं, जिससे ये दवाएँ उन बहुत-से लोगों के लिए पहुँच के बाहर हो जाती हैं जिन्हें उनकी सबसे ज्यादा जरूरत होती है।
प्रमुख दवा निर्माताओं - और इन करों से सबसे अधिक प्रभावित कई लोगों - के लिए प्रमुख स्थान होने के कारण - भारत और चीन को एक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय उदारीकरण के प्रयास का नेतृत्व करना चाहिए। फ़ोर्टालेज़ा, ब्राज़ील में 15-17 जुलाई को आयोजित होने वाला ब्रिक्स (BRICS) शिखर सम्मेलन इसे शुरू करने के लिए एक अच्छी जगह हो सकती है।
She recently suffered a heavy defeat in her Peronist party’s recent primaries, weakening its chances in the upcoming mid-term Congressional elections and undermining her authority during her remaining two years in office. In addition, she is now facing a legislative election in poor health, following surgery to remove a subdural hematoma in her brain.
Public opinion will not be sympathetic to fiscal discipline or neoliberal orthodoxy.
Naturally, everything can change in the future, including Russia's constitutional norms.
In addition, Rogozin is a pro-Putin politician, which is also very important to the bulk of voters, and he has managed to confirm this not only verbally, but also bureaucratically, by his work as the president's special representative for Kaliningrad Oblast affairs.
He reacts to Russia's domestic problems - widespread poverty, the situation in Chechnya, the fight against oligarchs - just as clearly, promptly, and explicitly, while most other politicians either keep silent or mumble incoherently.
Parallels between Rogozin and Saakashvili appear even more logical in view of the current situation in the Caucasus.
As a new round of negotiations with Iran begins – with European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton the first into the breach – finding a way to move Iran-US relations beyond their freighted past is an urgent matter.
Indeed, after years of sanctions, threats, negotiations, and then more sanctions and threats, the US remains unclear about what specific nuclear program it might accept.
Yet, despite increasing economic costs, Iran’s response only hardened.
Even if Iranian nuclear weapons are not acceptable to the US, President Barack Obama needs to start talking more openly about what is.
That, not Western bluster and sanctions, is the way ahead.
But such considerations were off the table well before the deliberations began.
But it gets worse.
And so they have.
The problems in Cyprus now threaten international financial stability.
In the belief that his judge, the late Laurence J. Rittenband, would renege on his promise to let Polanski go free after serving 42 days in a California prison, the director fled the United States in 1978 before his final sentence was announced.
He added that it was like “an infernal machine” that advances “blindly.”
If they are caught misbehaving, they are often treated with particular harshness by courts and the popular media alike.
So what should Polanski do?
Now, as the party’s presumptive nominee, he must move back toward the political center, where the majority of voters are to be found.
The energy and optimism that he unleashed in his administration’s first hundred days did not reflect concrete policy proposals in his campaign.
Bush showed emotional intelligence in midlife by mastering his problems with alcohol, and in displaying the courage to persevere with unpopular policies. But, at some point, perseverance becomes emotional stubbornness.
PALO ALTO – The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), it seems, cannot win.
In reality, the trade imbalance reflects the difference between China’s large savings surplus and the even bigger US saving deficiency (largely explained by the US fiscal deficit).
For example, if an employer (particularly an exporter) fears future renminbi appreciation, he may hesitate to raise wages in line with productivity increases, in order to keep his costs under control.
Again, this would inevitably trigger hot-money inflows, with speculators taking advantage of the spread between Chinese interest rates and the near-zero, short-term rates in developed economies, thereby driving up the renminbi further (and creating yet more opportunities for speculation).
For now, if China tries to liberalize its financial markets, hot money will flow the wrong way – into the economy, rather than out.
Due to my activism, however, China refused to renew my passport.
Human rights need not take a back seat to doing business with China.
After he served his term, the same officials funneled government funds to hire 200 thugs to punish him further by keeping him confined to his house.
The oil price remained stable, but the ruble and the stock-price indices lost 30% in the subsequent 24 hours.
Thus, the CBR would be able to provide a massive pile of rubles to Rosneft at below-market rates. So why did the deal trigger a panic?
Given that the price of oil is likely to remain low, Asian financiers – even the Chinese – do not seem eager to refinance Russian companies, and sanctions are unlikely to be lifted, investors clearly wanted a bigger and bolder solution.
This immediately raised suspicion that the CBR delayed the interest-rate hike in order to complete the deal at the lower rate.
American foreign policy, for all its shortcomings, has underpinned political stability around the world.
Rule II: Concentrate on the Elephants
In the Middle East, the US confronts Iran, which seeks to expand its power by any means it can, to oust neighboring countries’ governments in favor of ideologically sympathetic forces, and ultimately to evict America from the region.
If Americans had to pay more for gasoline, they would use less of it.  With a high gasoline price, alternative sources of energy such as ethanol and alternative forms of transportation such as electrically powered automobiles would become commercially viable.
They then proceeded, following a script, to switch props and roles, the first nurse reading from the file, “Alexa Holmes, Type A blood,” and the second reading from the bag, “Type A blood.”
Might there be a causal relation between the Bush administration’s cavalier, if not hostile, attitude toward law and its dazzling inability to acknowledge mistakes and manage midstream readjustments? Could it be that a willingness to flout the law and circumvent the Constitution tends to produce not nimbleness, but obduracy and intransigence?
But excessive secrecy leads to scarce resources being diverted into wild-goose chases.
Running from Musharraf
A president’s modernizing vision degenerated into a dictator’s power-driven myopia.
Or so the US believed.
Musharraf, according to his lawyer’s depositions before the Supreme Court, plans to give up his uniform after the indirect presidential elections he scheduled for October 6.
Running in Place on Trade
In retrospect, it is easy to see why.
Of course, we might still have yielded to pressure for protectionist measures, especially as WTO rules leave open the possibility of such a response.
Were he to opt to close the Doha Round as it has been negotiated to date, he could become a general without any troops.
We could even call this the Obama Round.
The organizers of the exhibition stated that they wanted to attract attention to the new role of religious institutions in Russian life.
Followers promptly destroyed 150 billboards in Moscow.
In April 2003, the Duma voted to toughen the law against inciting religious hatred by adding prison terms of up to five years for offenders.
Almost none of the writers had seen the exhibition - most had signed form letters.
But, with Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority demanding its own state, and with Russia refusing to recognize UN mediator Martti Ahtisaari’s plan for conditional independence, the US is preparing to go it alone.
Spain and Cyprus with their worries over secessionist-minded regions, are worried by any possible precedent.
Russia’s supposed “peacekeeping troops” in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia’s other secession-minded region, have in fact protected their rebel governments.
Military projections by the US have repeatedly suggested that Azerbaijan would lose such a battle, even with newly purchased equipment and Turkish military support.
The world, it appears, is on the brink of Cold War II. Some even say that it has already begun.
Taking advantage of Russia’s weaknesses and the lack of a counterweight, they refused to heed warnings against claiming a monopoly on global leadership.
Yet we succeeded in ameliorating it – not just normalizing relations but ending the Cold War confrontation itself.
And, as different as they are, they share one key feature: none has a military solution.
Along the same lines, during Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev’s presidency, he called for the creation of a mechanism for European preventive diplomacy and mandatory consultations in the event of a threat to any state’s security.
Indeed, Russia’s leaders fundamentally misjudged the West’s intentions and created an entirely unnecessary confrontation that undermines both sides’ interests.
It was those countries’ ambitions, not some vendetta against Russia, that drove EU and NATO enlargement.
When I became Secretary General of NATO in 2009, I identified a strengthened relationship with Russia as a top priority.
This approach offers the best chance of bringing an end to the current confrontation, and compelling Russia to engage constructively with the West.
Indeed, traditional balance-of-power theory suggests that US primacy in power resources should be offset by a Sino-Russian partnership.
Last May, shortly after the annexation of Crimea, Russia announced a $400 billion deal to supply 38 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to China annually for 30 years, beginning in 2019.
Consider the demographic situation in eastern Siberia, where six million Russians live across the border from up to 120 million Chinese.
The Sino-Russian alliance in the twentieth century was a product of China’s weakness following World War II and at the beginning of the Cold War – and, even then, it lasted little more than a decade.
Scholars, think-tankers, and journalists (both Russian and foreign) joined political and business leaders to discuss Russia’s future.
The pessimists – mainly Russian historians – claimed that Russia would find it difficult, if not impossible, to overcome its legacy of autocracy.
The discussion about autocracy was inevitably bound up with others. Autocracy has been defended in Russia as necessary for empire.
The alternative view, championed by people such as Igor Yurgens, head of Medvedev’s favorite think tank, The Institute of Contemporary Development, is that democracy is the precondition for economic modernization.
Moreover, Medvedev’s main strategic goal must be to secure a second term as president.
Indeed, Russia’s decline may make it even more dangerous.
And its population is shrinking – not least because the average man in Russia dies at age 65, a full decade earlier than in other developed countries.
States in decline – think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 – tend to become less risk-averse and thus much more dangerous.
Others at the conference argued that the West should change the game by expelling Russia from SWIFT, the international framework for clearing bank payments.
Putin left early, proclaiming that Western sanctions were harming European economies more than Russia anyway.
The new plants, like Iran’s first Russian-built reactor at Bushehr, would be subject to International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring and use only Russian-made nuclear fuel, which would be returned to Russia for storage to prevent Iran from developing dangerous nuclear technologies.
Moreover, the Kremlin has relaxed its opposition to Pakistan’s full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, along with China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
Why Russia’s Economy Will Not Collapse
Russia needed to borrow, and it was borrowing heavily in foreign currency.
The ruble’s free fall has been driven mainly by capital outflows.
The threat to Putin is clear.
None of this means that the West should bow and forsake its principles.
By adopting an aggressive, revisionist stance, Putin has made a historic and strategic mistake. Putin’s model should have been Peter the Great.
Whether he is seeking to weaken Ukraine or to enlarge Russia’s territory, Europe’s response must be firm.
The goal cannot be simply to contain Russia.
In its negotiations with Russia, Europe holds the stronger cards.
But Putin remains unprepared to act; in fact, so far, he has pretended that there is no crisis at all.
Though accurate and timely statistics on Russia’s economy – needed to guide effective measures to counter the crisis – are readily available to the public online, Putin claims not to use the Internet.
In short, Putin – who is no economic expert – makes all major economic policy decisions in Russia, delivering orders to top managers of state-owned enterprises and individual ministers in ad hoc, one-on-one meetings.
Suddenly, oil revenues are no longer sufficient to cover all three.
The Global Consequences of Russia’s Isolation
Last spring, the country’s foreign reserves amounted to a healthy $472 billion, helped by a substantial current-account surplus; and, according to the Central Bank of Russia, the country’s total foreign assets stood at $1.4 trillion, exceeding its liabilities of $1.2 trillion.
And when international security issues become salient, such as during the current Russian crisis, free movement of capital generates even greater volatility.
In short, the world order is being recast – and Russia is losing its place.
But his vague language reflected a larger hesitation that will probably persist until the crisis is over.
But serious conversations between the two men started last September, during Putin’s visit to Gdansk to mark the 70th anniversary of WWII’s start.
Faced with this situation, the Russian leadership sees both new dangers and new opportunities, which are often intimately interlinked.
Still, there are important caveats.
This is crucial.
The same could be said of the current conflict between Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the West: It is, at root, a collision between the West’s supposedly universal values and Russia’s quest for a distinct identity.
Putin knows that Russia’s reemergence on the global stage must be underpinned by a counterpoint to American exceptionalism, a national identity based on a distinct conception of history and distinct ideals.
In Putin’s view, the 1945 Yalta Agreement, which divided Europe into Soviet and Western spheres of influence, did not die; its borders simply moved eastward.
Russia does not need to upend the existing global order; it simply needs to find its place.
But it is impossible to contemplate the case without thinking that somehow, directly or indirectly, the path to assassination started near the Kremlin’s door.
In tough times, according to this view, one cannot choose one’s allies.
The forest of Russian flags provided a powerful symbol, a promise that another Russia was possible – and may yet still be.
“Is there a crisis in Moscow? No, there is no crisis.”
But neither Luzhkov, nor whoever may replace him, must worry about voter approval, as the Kremlin appoints Moscow’s mayor, rather than allowing for free and fair elections – a practice instituted a few years back by then-President Vladimir Putin for all such important positions across Russia.
The fires in the European part of Russia have destroyed 190,000 hectares of forest.
The burning summer of 2010 may help Russians to understand that their very existence depends on whether the authorities can provide assistance in times of emergency.
So far, Russian airstrikes have been concentrated in Latakia, Hama, and Idlib, where they have enabled Assad’s regime to make several advances.
Russia’s air force lacks the breadth of precision weapons and targeting systems fielded by the West – a reality that produced horrific consequences during the Georgian war in 2008 and the first and second Chechen wars in 1994-1996 and 1999-2009.
Military defeat, combined with worsening economic conditions, would likely turn much of the public – and more than a few of his cronies – against him.
Russia’s Indefensible Military Budget
Russia’s government was slow to accept reality, with President Vladimir Putin signing a revised budget only last month.
At this rate, its reserve fund will be emptied before the end of the year.
Moreover, its defense industry lacks the capacity to produce modern equipment as quickly as the plan anticipated.
The Cold War and the Cold Shoulder
Indeed, Russia’s reaction is consistent with its recurrent discourse about being “squeezed out” of its own neighborhood and “encircled” by hostile Western powers.
This geopolitical collapse occurred in part because Russians (not to mention their “captive nations” in Central and Eastern Europe) were seduced into believing that Western-style democracy and free markets worked better.
Its loss in the Crimean War of 1853-1856 led to the abolition of serfdom and other liberal reforms.
Indeed, the Soviet Union had a similar experience 40 years ago, when a protracted period of rising oil revenues fueled an increasingly assertive foreign policy, which culminated in the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.
With oil prices steadily rising, the value of Russian oil production reached a new peak, roughly ten times the 1999 level, in 2008; Russia invaded Georgia the same year.
President Vladimir Putin’s new Novorossya project simply cannot progress with oil prices at their current level.
Inflation shot up to 16%.
And while the Russian government singled out some enterprises as “strategic,” it actually gave them very little money.
Accomplishing this has required Putin to abandon some of his regime’s taboos.
Still, the significance of these changes should not be exaggerated.
So far, public reaction has been muted, but a two-week protest by Russia’s truck drivers over a new highway toll suggests that popular quiescence may not last.
Putin in the Dock
The judgment is the largest ever awarded by the arbitration court, and it cannot be appealed.
Indeed, it recently vetoed a Security Council resolution, sought by Malaysia, Ukraine, the Netherlands, Australia, and Belgium, to establish a criminal tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014 over rebel-occupied territory in eastern Ukraine.
Finally, while Russia has established de facto control of Crimea, it is likely to find itself increasingly embroiled in legal challenges to its presence there.
Putin may have been able to bring his country’s legal system under his control, but he remains vulnerable to international rulings.
Contemporary Russians consume competitive products: Nestle cereals, Mercedes cars, Hollywood movies.
Mortgages are available at outrageously high interest rates.
Foreign managers don’t seem to mind.
Scientists go on trial for technical espionage, while ex-KGB spies sign multi-billion dollar contracts.
Many Westerners eagerly pay more for “Fair Trade” coffee.
With huge current-account and budget surpluses, it had accumulated international reserves of $600 billion by July.
By recognizing the “independence” of the two occupied territories, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Russia turned the whole world against it.
As the stock market dives, they receive margin calls and are being forced to sell their shares at ever-lower prices, causing the stock market’s downward spiral to accelerate.
A reasonable guess would be that Moscow’s astronomic real-estate prices will fall by at least two-thirds.
The villain in this drama is Vladimir Putin, who has thrived on eight years of rapid growth generated by the market reforms of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
Russian capitalism hates the consumer as much as Russian communism did.
Moscow nowadays has all the trappings of high-end capitalism: Prada, Fouchon, Rolls Royce.
But perhaps the authorities are right to want to keep us in line.
Soviet socialism thought its citizens unworthy of any form of service altogether; Russian capitalism doubts that you can control your appetites, so it wants to control them for you.
The resulting empire will be liberal, according to Chubais’s definition, because it can be built with money rather than tanks.
Russia’s main foreign policy instrument in Georgia is Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly.
When the Georgian authorities announced plans to privatize the Inguri Power Plant and renew construction of the long-stalled Khudoni Power Plant, slated to become Georgia’s largest, RAO UES immediately began staking out a dominant role for itself in both projects.
In eternal Russia, nothing changes when it comes to monetary management.
It is inevitably a long road from a starting point where credits are channeled to state-owned enterprises through state-owned banks to an economic environment in which interest rates are a proper indicator of monetary policy.
Of course, many central banks around the world pursue both price stability and growth.
Today’s Kremlin thinks that democracy was being built too quickly in Russia.
Never would the law in its current form have passed through the old State Duma.
I firmly believe that we should not allow ourselves to participate in these games, nor that we should believe that Russia’s fascist organizations don’t have anything to do with the government.
We should not lose heart, but we do need to be politically active and united.
There is concern about Russia’s future, how it will use its newfound power, and how the West should respond.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice declared in 2005 that “the fundamental character of regimes matters more today than the international distribution of power,” and Senator John McCain, a US presidential candidate, has urged removing Russia from the Group of Eight advanced countries.
Riding on record-high energy prices and raw material exports, in January 2007 Russia became the world’s tenth-largest economy.
Finally, while one can understand a former superpower’s temptation to seize its opportunity to return to a muscular foreign policy, Russia’s bullying in the energy area is destroying trust and undercutting Russia’s soft power in other countries.
Yet none of this amounts to a fundamental change in Russia’s strategy, because Russia continues to adhere to its fundamental decision, made in the early 1990’s, to open itself to the West.
Theoretically, there remain different parties, elections, a pluralistic society, an independent judiciary, and a market economy.
The most important aspect of this will be to secure real judicial independence.
Above all, the European Union and its member states cannot allow Russia to recapture its imperial spheres of influence without severely damaging its own central interests.
Whether or not their relationship is in fact neighborly, rather than tense and confrontational, is of critical importance to both.
A look beyond the cordial rhetoric reveals profound differences.
Russia certainly pursues economic interests with its gas-export policy – all the more so when gas prices are trending down – and it wants to expand its role on the European gas market to intensify the dependencies that now exist.
Once those aims are achieved and/or Nabucco goes ahead, South Stream will be shelved because it doesn’t make economic sense.
In particular, the Russian utility giant Gazprom uses increases in gas prices as a means to punish “disobedient” neighbors.
Ethnic Georgians living in Russia, including those who are Russian citizens, became targets of persecution.
With Gazprom having already doubled gas tariffs for Georgia, the energy noose is tightening.
So once again Russians must face how ineffective their military is.
It suggested, instead, that the army should play a secondary role in anti-terrorist operations.
It is now obvious that overwhelming numbers don't provide an advantage in fighting terrorism, because it is the terrorists who have the initiative.
But neither Russia's president nor its power ministries seem ready for this.
In 2004, she was arrested and, in 2006, sentenced to six and a half years on embezzlement and tax fraud charges.
When Dmitry Medvedev was elected as Russia’s president a little more than a year ago, he promised to do away with the “legal nihilism” in Russia.
So the authorities’ aim seems clear: put Khodorkovsky and Lebedev away for a much longer time – more than 20 years if they are convicted.
It was his ambition to subject the country to truly far-reaching social and political reforms that sealed his downfall and also brought about this new trial, which appears intended to silence him for good.
Russia’s illegal occupation of the south Kuril Islands began on August 18, 1945, three days after Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration (or the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender), which ended the Pacific War.
Hatoyama is the grandson of Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, who signed the Japanese-Soviet Joint Declaration on October 19, 1956, which formally restored diplomatic relations between two countries and also enabled Japan’s entry into the United Nations.
But it is not only Japan that needs a government that takes regional security issues seriously.
Russia’s somewhat archaic political culture overly personifies power.
The real historical significance of the choice that Russia will face in 2008 will be determined not by the next president’s personal qualities, but by his loyalties – that is, to whom he owes his job.
But freedom and democracy do restrict arbitrariness and theft, and encourage politicians, regardless of their moral qualities, to take public interests into account.
Who loved this woman and why did he want everyone to know of his passion? Rumors had it that one of Russia's richest men wanted to impress his sweetheart.
The billboards with their private messages were able to occupy public space so easily because in Russia public space is virtually empty: there's very little, if any, communication between state and society, and barely any public debate.
Instead, political life here has been reduced to mere formality.
No professional solidarity was shown back in 2001, when Russia's private national television network NTV was taken over by the government.
Did Khodorkovsky write the letter, or had he merely signed it?
Whereas China intends to seduce and impress the world by the number of its Olympic medals, Russia wants to impress the world by demonstrating its military superiority.
For it is clearer than ever that Vladimir Putin is still in charge.
But Russia is not interested in joining, at least not on Europe’s terms.
The current crisis in the Caucasus does not mark the return of the Cold War, nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between Russia and the West; it is, more simply, the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the Russian Empire more than a century ago.
President Dmitri Medvedev’s approval ratings are only slightly lower.
The perennial Russian order – the dominant state and a powerless, fragmented society – remains largely in place.
The non-intrusive nature of the government is appreciated: people eagerly engage in their private affairs – with little regard for the political realm, which they have willingly abandoned.
For now, at least, provincial Russians and the new urban class alike have accepted Putin’s no-participation pact.
Worse, might Russia turn this weapon on an energy-addicted EU? That a German ex-chancellor is going to lead the company that could provide Russia with a means to manipulate the EU economy is testimony to Europe’s dangerous complacency in the face of Putin’s neo-imperialist ambitions.
As a former Head of State of newly independent Lithuania, I frequently endured such threats.
We, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, have been taught by our legacy that behind Russia’s every diplomatic act lurks imperial ambition.
But the problem is not so simple. The United States, Europe, Japan, Australia, and Canada have all seen declining birth rates as well.
By contrast, Solzhenitsyn, Tolstoy, and other writers in Russia’s great literary tradition fully understood this responsibility.
MOSCOW – Ramzan Kadyrov, the president of Chechnya, recently proposed to Ahmed Zakaev, a leader of the nationalistic and comparatively moderate Chechen opposition, that he return to Chechnya.
But the Kremlin wants to avoid this, owing to Kadyrov’s growing power and its general unease with a Russian Muslim elite that, while formally acknowledging Russian suzerainty, increasingly demands a redistribution of power within the Russian Federation.
Kadyrov seemed an effective antidote to the jihadists.
But he maintained that Islam is an essential part of the Chechen tradition and presented himself as a leader who fully understood this.
Mounting authoritarianism in Russia and Ukraine’s Orange Revolution seem to have ended the honeymoon the two men had enjoyed.
This turn of events is confusing.
Indeed, a chill is settling over Russia’s relations with the West more broadly.
But we placed amateurs in charge of dealing with Ukraine – amateurs with far-reaching commercial interests. When Putin was dragged in to cover up the mess, an ordinary failure turned into a total fiasco.
But the outside world’s assessment of Russia’s policies and prospects are visibly changing for the worse.
In fact, Putin’s “but” renders his points senseless.
The Dissenters Marches, which take place on the 31st of every month (article 31 of the Russian constitution guarantees freedom of assembly), could be (and are) easily dismissed as a marginal protest of a few hundred people with no common goals or ideas.
The best brains in Russia –engineers, scientists, and inventors – will gather in one place, and from there begin moving the country forward.
Journalists are killed, scientists are accused of espionage, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky remains unjustly imprisoned.
Similarly, in a country where the concepts of democracy and freedom are balanced by “but,” achievements in science, technology, and economy are not possible.
Suspense seems to be building around how Bush and Putin will greet each other when they meet in St. Petersburg.
Even so, Putin does seem genuinely popular among a public longing for a leader who can anchor their country without sinking it.
Indeed, many of the elderly in rural Russia are forced to sustain themselves by growing potatoes on the tiny plots of land that the government allows them to till.
Indeed, historians have counted as many as 25 such cycles since the reign of Tsar Ivan III.
Third, the soaring price of oil has made the Kremlin’s inhabitants believe that they are all-powerful.
The real threat is to the Putin model of a corporate, authoritarian state, unfriendly to the West.
Indeed, the weakened Russia that will be Putin’s legacy will then also lose the Northern Caucasus and the Volga region to their growing Muslim populations.
Unwilling to see their boys die for the Donbas, they will form an anti-war movement that will force him to rein in his territorial ambitions.
That is why the Kremlin has repackaged derogatory historical terms like “Nazis” to refer to Ukraine’s current political elites.
Indeed, only a small portion of the middle class attended the protests that gathered force in late 2011 and early 2012, most of them concentrated in Moscow.
On the contrary, the ice is expanding.
After months of empty promises by separatist leaders, the citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk are unlikely to acquiesce quietly to Donbas’s transformation into another internationally isolated pariah entity that benefits Russia-based criminal networks.
For their part, Ukrainian rebel leaders, loath to lose their newly acquired fiefdoms, are lobbying fervently against any rapprochement between the Russian and Ukrainian governments.
By annexing Crimea, he lost Ukraine.
Two matters – besides the shaky global economy – are especially important for the G-8 summit.
Following on this progress, at the end of 2010, the Russians agreed to study the possibility of cooperating with NATO on anti-missile defense.
For Obama, success would vindicate the Nobel Peace Prize that he was awarded in 2009.
Last month, Gazprom announced its intention to cease shipments through Ukraine when the contracts with the country's gas pipeline company, Naftogaz, expire in 2019.
Gazprom receives two-thirds of its hard-currency revenues from Europe, and a period of falling exports and domestic economic crisis is not the ideal time to play games with your best customer.
We're paying on time, and we're paying in hard currency. So I think we should be treated accordingly."
WASHINGTON, DC – When Russian President Vladimir Putin presides over the military parade commemorating Victory in Europe Day on May 9, he will not attract the crowd he could have expected a couple of years ago.
The Nazi-Soviet pact, which carved up Poland and Romania between the Soviet Union and Germany, has been swept under the rug.
Meanwhile, Ukraine’s neighbors are left feeling vulnerable, worried that Russia’s efforts to destabilize the region may cross yet another border.
WASHINGTON, DC – Ukraine’s economy may no longer be in free fall, but it remains in dire straits.
Last year alone, Ukraine’s exports to Russia – which included machinery, steel, agricultural goods, and chemicals – fell by half.
Russia’s apparent but undeclared aim is to make sure that democratic Ukraine fails, without looking entirely guilty of having caused that failure.
Ukraine’s stabilization program with the International Monetary Fund is sound but underfunded.
Russian Realities
But how much will it matter?
Nor will any posture succeed that seeks to put Russia forward as a geopolitical counterweight to the United States.
Its voice should be heard on matters ranging from terrorism and weapons proliferation to global climate change and energy policy.
His peace overture to Israel stunned the Middle East.
This alliance was so vital an objective for Sadat that one may rightly wonder what came first in his strategy.
Leaders, more often than not, are hostage to the socio-political environment that produces them, rather than its shapers.
Through his visit to Jerusalem, Sadat shook away Israel’s siege mentality and gave psychological living space to an otherwise claustrophobic nation in the midst of a hostile Arab world.
Most egregious was the post-invasion rush to “de-Ba’athification,” which eviscerated many of the country’s existing institutions.
Instead of recurring to an international forum, a devastating war was declared that went beyond deposing Saddam, wreaking damage on tens of thousands of civilians, and thus confounding the message of condemnation.
Although officially adopted in December 2003 by the Iraqi Governing Council, the IST’s statute was framed under contract to the US government and approved by L. Paul Bremer, the Coalition Provisional Authority’s Administrator.
According to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, this problem has ostensibly been “solved” by means of extracted confessions.
Furthermore, economic-policy changes and structural reforms that were enacted in the wake of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis significantly reduced the region’s vulnerability to financial shocks over the past decade.
For example, segmented production for global supply chains has stimulated trade in intermediate goods and promoted foreign direct investment.
And, to address volatile capital flows, countries should increase exchange-rate flexibility, maintain adequate international reserves, and implement carefully designed capital controls.
Remaking Iran
Though Rouhani has made little headway combating rampant inflation, small business and the entrepreneurial middle class seem to be thriving.
Thus, he described the regime instituted by Khomeini as a religious democracy in which all high state offices, including his own, derive their legitimacy from the will of the people as expressed in elections.
The IRGC’s commander, General Mohammad Ali Jafari, has publicly expressed his hostility to Rouhani’s administration, while General Hassan Firouzabadi, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, has countered by expressing his support for the president.
That brief conversation – the first between the two countries’ presidents since 1979 – recalls the last attempt to revive bilateral diplomacy, undertaken 12 years ago by Iran’s then-President Mohammad Khatami.
There had been earlier attempts to improve relations with the Americans.
The aggressive rhetoric of Clinton’s successor, George W. Bush, who called Iran part of an “axis of evil” prior to the US-led invasion of Iraq, made Khamenei apprehensive, and he endorsed an initiative for a dialogue with the Americans in 2003.
CAMBRIDGE – Not long ago, a Harvard colleague wrote to me that Saif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of Libya’s dictator, would be in town and wanted to meet me.
These scholars have been pilloried in the media in recent weeks for supposedly having cozied up to Qaddafi.
And yet few would deny that China’s is a repressive regime that deals with its opponents harshly.
Most moral philosophers would say that helping the hostages is the right thing to do in this instance, even if doing so also helps the terrorist.
PRINCETON – Ten years after her death, Princess Diana still has star power.
Margaret Evans, a British researcher, studied tributes people left for Diana after her death and found that some referred to her as a saint, or an angel, and a few compared her directly with Jesus.
As she went through a messy divorce triggered by an unfaithful husband, millions of women shared her pain.
If you can convince yourself that everyone behaves selfishly, then why try to be a better person?


यह विरोध देश की अक्सर तिक्ततापूर्ण विभाजनकारी राजनीति में भी परिलक्षित होता है। हर खेमे ने दो दुर्जेय महिला नेताओं के नेतृत्व में, बारी-बारी से सरकार को नियंत्रित करने को कोशिश की है: वर्तमान प्रधानमंत्री, अवामी लीग की शेख हसीना वाज़ेद, और उनकी दो-अवधियों की पूर्ववर्ती, बांग्लादेश नेशनलिस्ट पार्टी की बेगम ख़ालिदा ज़िया।
इसे ऐसा करना जारी रखना चाहिए। आज़ाद बांग्लादेश के "राष्ट्रपिता", शेख मुजिबुर रहमान जिनकी 1975 में हत्या कर दी गई थी, की बेटी - हसीना - जानती हैं कि इस्लामवादियों के साथ समझौता करने से वे कहीं की नहीं रहेंगी; वे उन्हें कभी भी स्वीकार्य नहीं होंगी। उनकी सरकार को सुशासन के नाम पर (या राजनीतिक अस्तित्व की ख़ातिर) चरमपंथियों को संतुष्ट करने के प्रलोभन का शिकार नहीं होना चाहिए।
The Kurds have never sought to achieve democratic goals through violence.
This is the case for people of all ethnic or religious communities in the Kurdish regions.
Yet, despite consistently demonstrating a commitment to democracy, the international community has been deaf to our appeals.
But since the 1960’s, the passions expended until then on righting collective wrongs have been increasingly channeled into securing the rights of humans as individuals. Indeed, if the West can be said to have a public philosophy nowadays, it is a philosophy of human rights.
It is simply unfair to withhold the status of marriage from those who want to make this public vow.
Families are having fewer and fewer children, and more and more children are born out of wedlock.
MOSCOW – Last spring, after Russia annexed Crimea and began intervening in eastern Ukraine, the United States and the European Union introduced sanctions against Russian individuals and businesses.
In all of these cases, Putin acted on the conviction that Russia’s oil wealth meant that rules – even international laws – did not apply to him.
In other words, Ukraine is merely a breakaway region of historical Russia.
Even more important, the West should make it clear that it extends its definition of Europe not just to Russia’s borders, but across them.
But this time it has.
Its successor, the National Development and Reform Commission, will probably function more as a think tank – providing ideas and ensuring policy coherence, but with no power to allocate.
Although the service sector was able to generate growth in the past, it has proved to be a poor job creator and only employs 27% of workers, far lower than its share of the economy.
Mobilizing these savings will require careful thinking about how the domestic financial system can be expanded by an order of magnitude without risking a future crisis.
China has long run large surpluses.
It was also true of the two Bretton Woods arrangements, in which the US ran the necessary deficits.
China currently saves and invests half of its GDP, but, as its workforce shrinks in the coming years, its investment rate is likely to fall sharply.
If the US is unable or unwilling to run the required deficits, the global economy will flounder in a savings glut of low demand and cheap capital until another alternative emerges.
The Ifo business climate indicator, which had been rising since the second half of 2005, reached its highest level since Germany’s unification boom.
Some are doing very well, indeed.
As the world’s second largest exporter, the German boom was initially driven by foreign sales.
Despite the boom, and despite various programs that stimulated part-time employment, unemployment in absolute terms was about 4.5 million in 2006 and will be 4.1 million in 2007, compared to the last low point of 3.9 million in 2000.
First, the military released a statement that the girls had been released, then retracted the statement when it was found to be untrue, deepening public outrage.
But there is precious little that they can do – and they should not have to do anything.
And the #ChildNotBride protests forced the National Assembly to defend its decision not to remove from the constitution Section 29.4(b), which states that any married woman, regardless of her age, qualifies as an adult, allowing her husband to compel her to renounce her rights as a Nigerian citizen.
Sarko v Sego At Last
With 31% of the vote he will come to the second ballot in a very favorable position.
The fourth winner, though his absence from the second ballot is a disappointment for him, is François Bayrou.
The key strategic move for the two remaining candidates will be to attract the votes of the Center without losing their core Leftist or Rightist constituencies.
To succeed, Nicolas Sarkozy will have to turn his campaign slogan “Together everything becomes possible” into reality.
And yet he is the least popular of the Fifth Republic’s presidents, the one whose “fall from grace” with the French has been the most spectacular, rapid, and durable, to the point where political experts, and his friends and foes alike, wonder whether he can rebound.
Of course, there is an element of deeply unfair subjectivity in this perception.
The left remains in disarray, caught between its internal feuds and the rise of anti-capitalist extremism at its margins.
The euro is gaining ground for several reasons.
It gives comfort to ECB critics like Sarkozy, and otherwise puts pressure on them to drop the central bank’s inflationary bias because of its effect on the euro.
The longer the ECB maintains its inflationary bias, the steeper the consequent economic decline as the economy crumbles under the weight of the skyrocketing euro and interest rates that are too high for current economic realities (though lower than where the ECB hawks had planned to go before the current financial crisis hit).
Winston Churchill’s famous denunciation of the delaying tactics of the British and French on the eve of World War II should be a warning to French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Two years, of course, is a long time in politics, and any predictions today about the presidential vote in 2012 would be imprudent.
Too much state is not the answer to a locally failed state.
PARIS – In 2003, France, under President Jacques Chirac, took the lead in opposing America’s planned invasion of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.
For him, this is what power is about: taking hard decisions under unfavorable circumstances.
And not only is Qaddafi truly bad, but Libya is comparatively small, and his forces appear relatively weak (this remains to be proven on the ground).
And today, with France taking the lead in an international effort to protect the Libyan people from their leader, they can feel simultaneously proud of being French and of their Arab roots.
It described an elaborate spider’s web of committees, councils, and agencies with overlapping responsibilities, unrepresentative memberships, and inadequate enforcement powers – a system built up incrementally over decades, with no guiding architectural hand or central authority to promote coherent global regulatory standards.
A “board” sounds more impressive, authoritative, and permanent than a mere “forum.”
The International Monetary Fund, for example, has always resented the FSB, arguing that the Fund itself should be the monitor of systemic risk – and thus serve as the de facto global financial regulator. But the IMF’s arguments have been weakened by a recently published report by its own evaluation office, highlighting the Fund’s failure to identify emerging risks in the run-up to the crisis.
They could be co-located in a regulatory Tower of Babel in Basel.
PARIS – A year ago, when Nicolas Sarkozy was campaigning for the French presidency, he promised a “rupture” with the past.
But, although Sarkozy may not have sold his party on the merits of George Bush’s America, he has softened its once habitual suspicions about the US.
Although Mitterrand did stand firm with the US on the stationing of Pershing missiles in Europe in the early 1980’s, which won him respect from President Ronald Reagan, by this point the Gaullist consensus on the fundamentals of French foreign policy had spread across all political groups.
Speculators could have “front run” the bank in the markets, selling short, driving equity prices down, and forcing the French financial institution to sell into a bottomless pit.
In this changed political environment, Sarkozy is not likely to go after someone like Noyer who, as Bank of France Governor and a member of the ECB’s Governing Council, is widely viewed as a stalwart against inflation and a defender of French purchasing power.
Foreign bank mergers have proved poisonous for euro-zone central bankers.
France ’s re-integration into NATO is, in fact, the final stage in a process that has seen the French military play an increasingly important role in the alliance’s operations.
France’s full engagement will increase the pace of reform in NATO and make the alliance a tool better adapted to twenty-first-century crises by paring down its cumbersome bureaucracy.
If that were the case, Sarkozy’s decision, regardless of the advantages to NATO or France, would clearly be open to question.
Sarkozy's decision has put France in a position to gain influence in the alliance and increase the pace of NATO’s reform, while at the same time strengthening the ESDP.
But just when these countries were beginning to achieve success, the US shale revolution emerged, threatening all three of their main strategic objectives.
After all, game theory dictates that, once the surplus is eliminated, the dominant producer must prevent oil prices from rising high enough to cause it to lose market share again. That means that Saudi Arabia will try to compel non-OPEC countries, mainly in North America, to keep oil-production increases commensurate with growth in global demand.
The enthusiasm is obvious, and the campaign is already under way and highly spirited.
This pressure for change has been building for years.
The fact that most of the perpetrators of the attacks were identified as Saudis highlighted the country’s backward realities and provoked mounting international pressures for change.
BEIRUT – On February 24, violent confrontations between Shia pilgrims and the Saudi religious police and security forces occurred at the entrance to the Prophet Mohamed’s Mosque in Medina.
The violence outside the Medina mosque has led to unprecedented demonstrations in front of Saudi embassies in London, Berlin, and The Hague, with protesters demanding independence from the Saudi state.
Only by transforming Saudi Arabia’s currently monolithic Saudi/Wahhabi national identity into a more inclusive one will the Kingdom become a model that is attractive to its minorities.
Saudi Arabia’s Shia, an economically and politically marginalized community, staged an unprecedented intifada in the towns of Qatif, Saihat, Safwa, and Awamiyya.
Saudi Arabia’s Phony War on Terror
From this perspective, Saudi Arabia’s surprise announcement of a 34-country anti-terror alliance, with a joint operations center based in Riyadh, is a logical step, aimed at blunting growing Western criticism, while boosting Sunni influence in the Middle East. But, of course, the alliance is a sham – as a closer look at its membership makes clear.
A smaller Saudi-led Arab coalition has been bombing Yemen since March, with the goal of pushing back the Shia Houthi rebels who captured Sana’a, the capital, after driving the Saudi-backed government from power. Saudi warplanes have bombed homes, markets, hospitals, and refugee camps in Yemen, leading critics to accuse the Kingdom of deliberately terrorizing civilians to turn public opinion against the Houthis.
American policy is based overwhelmingly on the idea that Africa can lift itself out of extreme poverty through its own efforts, that aid is largely misused because of corruption, and that the United States already gives generous amounts.
Third, Africa is economically isolated, owing to very poor infrastructure, large over-land distances, and many landlocked countries.
Indeed, America’s own Millennium Challenge Account has already recognized such African countries for their strong governance.
In addition, Africa needs help with anti-malaria medicines, diagnostic equipment, and training of community health workers.
Emerging markets’ external and fiscal positions have been stronger than ever, thanks to the hard lessons learned from their own crisis-prone history.
Both economies have experienced currency crises within recent memory – South Korea in 1997-1998 and Brazil in 1999 – and both subsequently took steps to increase their financial resilience.
South Korea is hugely dependent on exports to advanced countries, Brazil much less so. 
If necessary, the IMF can issue special drawing rights (SDRs) to generate the global liquidity needed.
The priority for now is to save the emerging markets from the consequences of Wall Street’s financial follies.
So now is the time to build, not disrupt or impede, the international institutions that will manage our response to global climate change in the years ahead.
Assuming that annual per capita income grows at about 2% per year worldwide, a marginal expenditure of roughly $70 today to cut carbon emissions would be worth it if, accounting for damage from global warming and adjustment costs, the world of 2100 would be $500 richer in year-2006 purchasing power.
Saving Central America
In Guatemala, the major criminal organizations have long been embedded in the state, making gangs more of a vehicle of social mobility than anything else.
Guatemala receives as much as 10% of its national income from expatriates, usually in the US.
Originally financed by the European Union and others involved in the 1996 peace agreements, which ended 36 years of civil war, CICIG aimed to aid in the investigation and prosecution “of the crimes committed by members of the illegal bodies of security.”
Such institutions, together with the billion dollars that the US promised to the three countries last year, could help put them on the path toward stability.
In short, we are now witnessing a stunning concentration of power that is unprecedented in French republican history.
Moreover, France’s rapidly worsening foreign-trade deficit is boosting already-excessive debt levels, while output is falling and unemployment is rising.
Europe has succeeded in missing this goal for a half-century; now it has no choice but to shoot straight.
GENEVA – As 2015 begins, the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are under threat.
The failure to reflect the changing balance of global power brought about by the rise of China, Brazil, South Africa, and other emerging countries undermines both the effectiveness and the legitimacy of today’s international system, particularly in the eyes of those who feel denied of proper recognition.
They can no longer stand on the sidelines, denouncing the injustices of the past.
But why did Obama fence himself in with such rhetoric in the first place? Why this particular red line?
Mao Zedong was responsible for the deaths of more than 40 million Chinese in the 1950’s and 1960’s.
Hundreds of thousands?
No one is going to shoot missiles into China or Russia for the sake of upholding human rights or international standards of warfare.
This is the view of many people in Syria, even among the rebels.
These questions are crucial not only for France, because we are five months away from a French presidency of the European Union that should have been an important step in Europe’s own rebound.
Of course, if the international economic environment had been more favourable, and if there were not so much legitimate concern about declining purchasing power, the French might have shown greater indulgence towards their young president.
Despite some troubling similarities between Sarkozy and Vladimir Putin, French democracy is not in danger.
Annual output per person, adjusted for price levels in different parts of the world, averages around $10,000, implying total output of around $67 trillion.
This view has some truth.
Looking ahead, the world economy will need to introduce alternative technologies that conserve energy, water, and land, or that enable us to use new forms of renewable energy (such as solar and wind power) at much lower cost than today.
But if the world cooperates on the research, development, demonstration, and diffusion of resource-saving technologies and renewable energy sources, we will be able to continue to achieve rapid economic progress. 
The question for Egypt is whether the agenda of a truly pluralistic democracy – proclaimed by the avant-garde young protesters at Tahrir Square, the admirably self-empowered Facebook and Twitter generation – can prevail against the resilient forces of the past.
The masses called for a revolution, while the army conducted its own coup d’etat in the hope of saving what is essential in the system while sacrificing the man who embodied it.
But the regime that emerges is bound to be more attuned to local conditions, and thus to religion’s vital role in the social fabric.
Saving the Greek Sinner
The Greek disaster was possible because its government deceived its European partners for years with faked statistics. In order to qualify for the euro, the Greek government asserted that its budget deficit stood at 1.8% of GDP in 1999 – well below the 3%-of-GDP limit set by the Maastricht Treaty.
According to OECD statistics, pensions in Greece, available after only 15 years of work, reach an incredible 111% of average net incomes.
Greece’s public debt was placed in its own banking system, which is indebted to the European Central Bank via the issuance of euros.
This spring, before the first big issues of new Greek debt must be launched, the world will see which solution Europe has chosen.
Indeed, the share of government in employment in Scandinavia is surprising.
Prompted by capital flows to low-wage countries, specialization, outsourcing, and even immigration, the equilibrium price of unskilled labor has fallen throughout the western countries.
Edmund Phelps, this year’s Nobel laureate in economics, has also long advocated it.
In the United States, both Hillary Clinton and John McCain took the easy way out, and supported a suspension of the gasoline tax, at least for the summer.
Meanwhile, the financial sector failed to create products that would help ordinary people manage the risks they faced, including the risks of home ownership.
Given the huge increase in inequality in most countries, higher taxes for those who have done well – to help those who have lost ground from globalization and technological change – are in order, and could also ameliorate the strains imposed by soaring food and energy prices.
China’s Flawed Balance-of-Payments Position
In 2008, US corporations gained a 33% return on their investments in China, while other multinationals got a 22% return.
A country in the later stages of development can use investment income from its past accumulation of net foreign assets to compensate for the decline in citizens’ incomes due to aging and other changes.
In fact, this investment will never be repaid in full, so a large write-off is inevitable.
Now it looks as if the Asian approach may take some knocks, too.
But such criticism ignores the problems faced by banks that did not use or deal in complex financial products.
The fiscal problems of Greece and Spain were also the result of spending a great deal on high-technology and high-prestige projects: facilities for the Olympic Games, new airport buildings, high-speed train links.
But soon they encounter their own banana peel; indeed, today’s global economy is a riot of slipping economic models.
A Generation Held Hostage?
It is believed that the girls have been split into separate groups, so that any attempt to rescue one group would imperil the others.
To support and encourage more girls to attend school in the face of abduction threats, the Nigerian Safe Schools Initiative has been launched to fund fortifications, telecommunications, and security measures aimed at allaying children’s fears about going to what should be a safe haven.
But there is a war of liberation that remains to be won worldwide – against child labor, child marriage, child trafficking, and discrimination against girls.
Moreover, the number of long-term unemployed (27 weeks or longer) is about 40% of the total – thelowest share since 2009, but still far higher than in the previous recessions since the Great Depression, and about double what it would be in a normal labor market. So the US labor market, while healing, is still far from where it should be.
This has fanned speculation that a “mismatch” between workers’ skills and employers’ needs is a significant factor behind the elevatedunemployment rate.
The US was the world leader in high school and college graduation rates for much of the twentieth century. Today it ranks in the middle of the OECD countries.
The best answer is both ancient and simple: hubris.
The problem is that, no matter how “scientifically” these new beliefs were formulated, they are still false.
If investing is simply a matter of allocating money to an index, however, liquidity becomes the sole determinant of prices, and valuations go haywire.
But a market is not a rocket, economists are not rocket scientists, and moral hazard is, in human affairs, the risk that matters most.
If we cleave to the false security of a supposed science that isn’t working, and forget about the philosophy behind it, ideas like personal responsibility and the right to fail, our leaders will very scientifically give us no recovery at all.
Empathy alone does not necessarily prompt pro-social behavior; empathizing with the suffering of another may not drive you to help that person.
After all, living in a world that assumes we are homo economicus can encourage selfish habits.
These models will enable us to make clear, testable predictions about expected monetary-exchange behavior in an economic context, including in addressing common-good problems.
It will include items such as the common agricultural policy, regional structural funds, and research and innovation.
Rather, it has shifted in a more urgent, complex, and inherently unforeseeable way, as spelled out in the EU 2020 strategy’s vision of an “Innovation Union.”
The ERC puts its trust into the researchers it funds to know where the ”frontier” of science is.
The “Impact” Illusion in Science
It depicted an elderly couple at the breakfast table.
Another quintessential example of both the synergy and serendipity of basic research is the origin of recombinant DNA technology, the prototypical technique of modern genetic engineering (sometimes called “genetic modification,” or GM).
Their goal was to learn more about the rates of cellular mutation and the generation of antibody diversity.
As officials decide how that money is to be spent, they would be wise to glance in the rear-view mirror and fund the basic research that keeps science moving forward.
We have a responsibility to make sure we fulfill the promise we made at the beginning of the millennium: to ensure that boys and girls everywhere complete a full course of primary schooling.
That is why we must also set targets for secondary education, while improving quality and learning outcomes at all levels.
Learners of all ages need to become familiar with new technologies and cope with rapidly changing workplaces.
This is the challenge that inspired Norway to invite world leaders to Oslo for a Summit on Education for Development, where we can develop strategies for mobilizing political support for increasing financing for education.
It is a right for disabled children, just as it is for everyone else.
Salah satu cara untuk memperbaiki pengumpulan data serta penggunaannya demi pembangunan berkelanjutan adalah menciptakan hubungan aktif antara penyediaan layanan dan pengumpulan dan pengolahan data dalam pengambilan keputusan.
Saat ini, angka penerimaan sekolah cenderung dihitung berdasarkan pendaftaran siswa pada awal tahun ajaran, meskipun kehadiran sebenarnya mungkin jauh di bawah angka pendaftaran.
Mengingat bahwa banyak indikator utama belum dikumpulkan secara real time, tetapi hanya melalui survei rumah tangga retrospektif yang melelahkan, indikator utama untuk tujuan pengentasan kemiskinan sudah kadaluarsa selama lima tahun bagi banyak negara.
Crowdfunding or Crowdphishing?
And that will not change without adequate – and innovative – financial regulation.
The economic equilibrium we live should be regarded, above all, as a phishing equilibrium, in which small-time individual dishonesty can morph into something more systemically important when it is carried on by business organizations under intense competitive pressure.
That’s why channeling dispersed knowledge into new businesses requires a regulatory framework that favors the genuinely enlightened and honest.
It should require that the intermediary sponsoring a platform install a surveillance system to guard against interference and shills offering phony comments.
Today, more than 90% are.
In the developing world, one girl in seven is married by the age of 15; nearly half become mothers by the age of 18.
Appropriate modifications could turn these into secondary schools for part of each day, bringing secondary education closer to children’s homes.
The world stands at a crossroads.
He also introduced a de-Baathification law, which evicted members of the Baath Party from official positions without legal recourse, paving the way for sectarianism and, ultimately, communal violence and unrest.
Making matters worse for ordinary Iraqis, public services have deteriorated to a dismal level, and unemployment is rising sharply, despite public expenditure in excess of $500 billion over the seven years of Maliki’s rule.
Given a new law limiting senior officials to two terms in office, we also hope to see new and accountable leaders in positions of power.
The report proposes two alternatives.
When they spoke of creating a new system of collective security they meant it in the traditional military sense.”
The Security Council would judge the legitimacy of such action by whether it met the age-old criteria of just war: the seriousness of the threat, the purpose of the response, whether force is a last resort, whether it is used in a proportionate way, and whether there is a reasonable balance of good and bad consequences.
In the case of the Iraq War, President Bush never established a broad consensus that might have provided legitimacy in the face of a veto.
After all, such solidarity is what allowed Europe to prosper and integrate over the past 50 years. So why not stick to a winning formula where energy is concerned?
A fundamental part of this must be serious consultation among member states on strategic decisions that may affect an EU partner.
The EU must continue to insist that Russia ratify it, stipulating that Russia is already bound by its terms.
Whether or not Goldman is guilty, the transaction in question clearly had no social benefit.
Ordinary securities must be registered with the SEC before they can be traded.
It will be the task of regulators to understand derivatives and synthetic securities, and to refuse to allow their creation if they cannot fully evaluate the systemic risks.
Moreover, the five big banks that serve as market makers and account for more than 95% of over-the-counter transactions in the US are likely to oppose the proposal, because it would hit their profits.
It is indeed hard to believe that Russia and China, in particular, would be accommodating.
The P5 have obligations under the UN Charter, as well as international humanitarian and human rights law, not to undermine the effectiveness of the UN or that body of law.
The other would be a request for veto-restraint by at least 50 member states, including at least five members from each of the recognized geographical groupings.
The French proposal, though still evolving, has already struck a responsive chord internationally.
This is more appropriate to the task of reducing carbon emissions than a single price, because there is a multiplicity of sectors and methods, each of which produces a different cost curve.
Meanwhile, conditions changed with the passage of time: China, following decades of booming growth, replaced the United States as the largest emitter.
When the trees are cut and peatlands drained, the carbon accumulated over millennia is exposed and oxidized – often in the form of fires that envelope neighboring Singapore and Malaysia in smoke.
These efforts can serve as a prototype for assisting other countries such as Guyana, where the current forest-preservation scheme does not work so well.
Indeed, the plethora of separate banking regulators had created opportunities for banks to arbitrage the system in search of a more indulgent approach to capital.
A fashionable approach was known as “twin peaks,” whereby one regulator handled prudential regulation – setting capital requirements – while another oversaw adherence to business rules.
Among the single-regulator countries, Singapore and the Scandinavians were successful in dodging most of the fatal bullets, while the UK evidently was not.
There were major overhauls in 1986, and again in 1997, when the Bank of England lost its banking supervision responsibilities as a delayed response to the collapse of Barings.
But there is no sign of a considered assessment being prepared, which might at least help countries to make better-informed choices, even if it did not conclude that one model was unambiguously best.
Even the tiny country of Montenegro has had a hopeful few years since it declared independence in 2006.
Other policymakers, however, see an even greater risk that postponing EU accession into the indefinite future could undermine the credibility of the declaration made at Thessaloniki.
None of them will want the European Commission to note that one country is doing better than another.
MELBOURNE – In April, Germany’s parliament placed limits on the use of genetic diagnosis.
In an attempt to mitigate this problem, the law specifies that anyone taking out an insurance policy valued at more than €300,000 may be required to disclose the results of prior genetic tests.
If the child does inherit it, he or she will, at around 40, begin to suffer uncontrollable movements, personality changes, and a slow deterioration of cognitive capacities.
But if we take that into account, should we not also take into consideration the life of the child who the parents would have had, if they had been able to use prenatal diagnosis and be sure of having a child who does not carry the gene for the disease? Surely that child has better life prospects.
Are social critics right to worry about the atomized loneliness of big-city life?
In both cases, despite objections to the ruling ideology’s specific tenets, few reject the ethos itself.
Urban pride – what we call “civicism” – is a key feature of our identities today.
China, the United States, and even Canada may take years to implement serious plans to address climate change. Yet cities like Hangzhou, Portland, and Vancouver take pride in their “green” ethos, and go far beyond national requirements in terms of environmental protection.
Practically all developing countries’ reserves are invested in developed countries’ assets, leading to an increasing net transfer of resources from the developing to the developed world, which, according to UNDESA estimates, reached $720 billion in 2007 alone.
Official development assistance and multilateral bank lending, though valuable, remain insufficient.
Assuming a ratio of loans-to-capital of 2.4 times – an estimate based on the ratio of the successful and financially sound Andean Development Corporation – the expanded regional and sub-regional development banks or new ones could generate additional lending of approximately $120 billion.
Passive data, as the name suggests, are not generated consciously; they are by-products of our everyday technological existence.
Given the dramatic growth in the amount of data being generated, together with ever-expanding applications across industries, it is reasonable to expect that individual data will soon be worth more than $100 per Internet user.
Presumably, they could sell that information directly to the organizations that want it, instead of allowing Facebook to do so.
Selling America
As a result, politics has become a contest about credibility.
Skeptics who treat “public diplomacy” as a euphemism for broadcasting government propaganda miss the point.
They can support the teaching of English and finance student exchanges.
That means that Condoleezza Rice’s chief task as Secretary of State will be to make American foreign policy more consultative in style as she seeks a political solution in Iraq and progress on Middle East peace.
But Shiller was wrong.
This takes nothing away from the importance of the question that Shiller addressed.
Send in the Clowns
Of course, comic entertainment in politics is not just a modern phenomenon.
The problem with many democratic politicians today is that they have become almost as dull as the old communist autocrats. Most, especially in Europe, are professional politicians with no experience apart from working the levers of party machines.
John McCain managed to defeat his more conventional Republican rivals by seeming to be totally different from them: a maverick who says what he damned well wants, a tough guy with the knowing wink of the old ladies’ man.
Senegal’s Democracy Put to the Test
Furthermore, since 2003 state schools offer religious instruction (using authorized textbooks that are never Wahhabi in spirit), with the informal approval of secular and Sufi teachers alike.
Wade has substantial international prestige, because he led the final phase of the country’s long democratic transition in 2000. But Wade postponed legislative elections, originally scheduled for June 2006, first to February 2007, and later, by presidential decree, to June 2007.
Whereas the US is willing to spend $147 billion next year in the name of an implausible democracy in Iraq, it refuses to spend any imagination or money to shore up one of the most creative models of peace and democracy in the Islamic world.
During a lecture at the Korea National University of Education four days later, he stoked tensions further, saying of the Emperor of Japan’s proposed visit: “If he wants to come, he should apologize first for the past.”
The origins of the dispute over Takeshima lie in the period immediately before the Treaty of San Francisco was signed in 1951, formally ending World War II in the Pacific.
Until this point, neither China nor Taiwan expressed objections.
By allowing social tensions to mount to such a degree, the Chinese government may also be partly responsible for the recent rampage among thousands of workers at the Foxconn plant (where components for Apple iPods and iPads are made) in Taiyuan.
But civilian deaths as a result of military combat are not enough to say that “disproportionate force” has been used.
However, this does not mean that force becomes “disproportionate” simply when the costs outweigh the benefits.
In the justification of armed conflict, everyone agrees that the defending state may use all necessary force to repel an aggressor.
First, in international conflicts, the defending army must always protect the lives of its citizens, not just property interests.
Journalists on the ground would do well to inquire about the relevant military objectives rather than pass judgment on the basis of the numbers of civilians killed, which may have minimal relevance to legal analysis.
The Lega Nord, led by the charismatic Umberto Bossi, holds the decisive votes in Parliament to keep the Berlusconi government afloat.
This proposal seems to have found a certain degree of support from Berlusconi, though he would likely be the only one in the country to agree with it.



Nikolic, whose party’s leader, Vojislav Seselj, is currently being tried for war crimes in The Hague, has campaigned on an anti-Western, Euro-skeptic, and openly chauvinist platform, exploiting the Kosovo issue at every turn and putting Tadic and other pro-Europeans on the defensive.
From the perspective of the European Union (and many liberal Serbs), this narrative has the familiar ring of jingoism, obsessive self-regard, and an enduring attachment to victimhood.
Putin’s Dilemma
But, after the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Russia can no longer pursue a divide-and-rule strategy that leverages these differences.
These are large numbers even for Russia, with its currency reserves of $480 billion.
Over the last ten years, the question has been whether to keep the existing 18% value-added tax or replace it with a sales tax.
Consumption growth has been driven largely by Russia’s integration into the global economy – and cannot be sustained without it.
MEXICO CITY – The capture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán – one of the world’s most wanted criminals – is just one victory in the long fight against Mexico’s narcotics traffickers.
To be sure, a team of professionals leads Peña Nieto’s security cabinet; but other parts of this government are affected by the habits he acquired as Governor of the State of Mexico, the most populous of Mexico’s 31 states, which surrounds Mexico City.
She recorded part of a music video in the Michoacán Palace of Justice.
Although it is impossible to anticipate how Mexico’s many contemporary crises will end, we do know that in the coming years Mexico will continue to be characterized by a combination of solid macroeconomic numbers, chronic inequality, and structural violence.
Even regulators and industry experts are not aware of the true numbers of deaths and adverse events, due to the lack of proper reporting.
Trial subjects drawn from illegal Latin American immigrants were threatened with reporting of their illegal status to the US Department of Homeland Security if they complained about the risks of the drug that they received.
Advocates in the US, such as the ten-year-old human rights organization, Citizens for Responsible Care and Research (www.circare.org), which I co-founded, have proposed a universal National Human Subjects Protection Act.
And America’s decision to send Undersecretary of State William Burns to a meeting with Iran’s top nuclear negotiator suggests that those signals are being taken seriously.
In addition to far-reaching political and economic cooperation, the offer promises cooperation on nuclear matters, including the construction and supply of the newest light-water reactors in Iran, as well as Iranian access to nuclear research and development – provided that there is a negotiated settlement.
Iranian spokesmen also indicate that there is an official awareness of Israel’s importance for a comprehensive regional solution, and that doing business with Israel is no longer inconceivable.
Indeed, if a diplomatic solution fails, they are more likely to react more forcefully.
Granting balance-of-payments support has important fiscal implications, and it is natural that there should be continuing close oversight by those who ultimately provide the capital – the IMF’s member states.
The independent board members would constitute only a small minority, but their presence and professional expertise would give them disproportionate weight.
However, on financial matters (in particular the distribution of profits and losses), the voting rules are different: the Executive Board does not participate and the votes of the national central bank presidents in the Governing Council are weighted by their respective capital shares.
That is not just because vaccines are not readily available; it is also because women in these countries have limited access to screening and treatment.
Whether such attitudes and misinformation account for poor vaccine coverage in places like France and the US is still not known.
But, while HPV infection rates may be falling in some of these countries, are they falling fast enough?
Thus, one might infer that we face another seven years or so of bad times.
Likewise, many people have been wondering if the weakness that followed the equity and real-estate crash in Japan at the beginning of the 1990’s is relevant to our experience today.
Reinhart and Rogoff describe a “this time is different syndrome” during the pre-crisis boom, whereby these bubbles are allowed to continue for far too long, because people think that past episodes are irrelevant.
In that case perhaps all of those crisis-induced bad decades are no longer relevant.
Back then, Afghanistan’s people held great hopes for an immediately wonderful future.
It must be concentrated on the sanctuaries of those who train, equip, and motivate the extremists and send them out to hurt us all.
Unless we collectively address the roots of the problem by ending that support, as well as financial support for radicalism in all forms, we will not defeat terrorism.
Last year, I pardoned a 14-year-old boy from the Pakistan tribal area in Waziristan who had come to Afghanistan to blow himself up as a suicide bomber.
I said, “Why? Let him live here, let him work here, let him be an Afghan.”
On top of this historical foundation, we build our civilization.
As members of Vasily Chuikov’s 62nd Army, they grabbed hold of the nose of the Nazi army and did not let go.
The Allies probably would have eventually won World War II even had the Nazis conquered Stalingrad, redistributed their spearhead forces as mobile reserves, repelled the Red Army’s subsequent winter 1942 offensive, and seized the Caucasus oil fields, thus depriving the Red Army of 90% of its motor fuel.
ROME – Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s political and sexual exploits make headlines around the world, and not just in the tabloid press.
Since the 1990’s, his channels broadcast “Big Brother” and Italian variety shows dominated by male comedians, musclemen, and scantily clad young girls, popularly known as “veline.”
Nor are Italians reassured to learn that Berlusconi fielded a number of candidates during the recent European Parliament elections whose only discernible qualification was that they were pretty young girls who had possibly spent some time in the prime minister’s company at his Sardinian Villa or Roman Palazzo.
In the US, for example, President George W. Bush’s Patriot Act is being extended, following a series of backroom deals.
But now that public figures – especially those deemed to be “of interest” to intelligence agencies – are susceptible to being watched three-dimensionally, the chances of being compromised are far higher than they were in the days of the UK’s Profumo affair, which brought down a British defense secretary in the early 1960’s.
In the 1950’s, communism and the homosexual “threat” became wedded in the American public imagination.
Consider the official US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that revealed that State Department employees were asked to obtain “biometrics” on public officials at the United Nations.
“Generation consciousness,” unlike the “class consciousness” of old, is obviously not a defining factor in people’s political preferences.
This is a profound change that creates much friction in the transitional phase.
Advice ranges from sex in old age to tourism.
The impression of a generation on permanent holiday is deceptive in another respect.
Beyond that, the key feature of an aging society is the independence of the elderly.


Is Pakistan, a country long prone to military coups, finally developing a well-functioning political system?
By appointing a special tribunal to try Musharraf, the Sharif government is sending a strong signal to the military – particularly its senior commanders – that they are not above the law.
Unfortunately, unlike Sharif’s actions in Pakistan, this effort did not spur the development of a more stable political order.
Of course, the terms of the contract vary with place and time. In nineteenth-century Europe, the rich were expected to be frugal.
In the current crisis, popular anger is – no surprise – directed against bankers.
“Enrich yourselves” is the clarion call of our era; and in that moral blind spot lies a great danger.
They appear immovable until the moment they are evicted by popular anger.
The Western democracies will survive with only modest changes.
The rulers in Moscow and Beijing would do well to heed this warning.      
Making these reductions would cost about €200-350 billion annually by 2030 – less than 1% of projected global GDP in 2030.
Without carefully managing tropical forests – 90% of which grow in developing nations that have pressure to clear the land for other economic purposes – we cannot meet our global targets for reduced carbon emissions.
A developed nation cannot meet carbon emission targets by outsourcing its dirtiest production to a developing country, and a developing country cannot meet its targets by chopping down forests to build the plants or expand low-productivity agriculture.
When stressed, a big surface bifurcates in big chunks, but then the disintegration continues into smaller and smaller fragments.
The argument against European structures depends on hostility to a transfer union that might lead to some redistribution of resources.
It is now mired in an existential crisis more profound than at any point since 1945.
Share the Work
What is not well known, however, is that in the 1930’s, the United States, to a much greater extent than today, succeeded in mitigating these problems.
Second, legislation encouraged it.
In fact, the US already has something along these lines: a program known as Short-Time Compensation.
BONN – Sharks have long been portrayed as man-eaters, a menace to any swimmer brave (or foolish) enough to share the water with them.
Similarly, the shark-diving industry has brought in an estimated $110 million annually to Thailand, $22 million to the Canary Islands, and a massive $800 million to the Bahamas over the last 20 years.
Consider climate change.
It is time to launch concerted global efforts to protect some of the oldest, most vulnerable – and most valuable – species in our seas.
As one of the players at that summit, I understand the reason for the gap between what was agreed by the “moderates” and the harsh realities that have driven the “extremists” forward.
Abbas is being asked to play for high stakes – defeating Hamas and with it the cause of Islamic fundamentalism in the region – with inadequate resources.
The latest Sharm el-Sheikh summit is also a message to the Saudis: Cairo, not Mecca, is the center of Middle East politics.
In short, Sharon was the ideal center candidate: a leader who reconciled a dovish approach with a hawkish outlook.
On the left is Amir Peretz of the Labor party, a populist and trade-union federation leader with little national leadership experience and even less familiarity with security matters.
But in the upcoming elections, he is likely to be left out in the cold.
No one believes that Palestinian leader Abu Mazin can or will do anything to stop such attacks.
NEW DELHI – According to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters, his overwhelming victory in India’s general elections was a sweeping repudiation of everything for which the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, led by the Indian National Congress, stood. Will Modi live up to voters’ expectations?
This goal explains another policy reversal as well. The UPA’s critics long claimed that unsustainably low, state-dictated passenger fares and freight charges for rail services – which could not cover the cost of maintenance to ensure the safety of trains and tracks, much less enable expansion and improvement of service – reflected the government’s inability to make tough decisions.
The Modi government has also adopted the UPA-proposed Goods and Services Tax, which had been stalled by opposition from BJP-ruled states (including Modi’s Gujarat). And it will strengthen the national anti-terrorism effort, which Modi previously denounced as an assault on Indian federalism.
Both are frequent occurrences in Indian political life.
I suppose it is entirely possible that “Jayalalithaa” has attained political successes that might have eluded a mere “Jayalalitha.” But on what possible basis can it be argued that the addition of a superfluous vowel made all the difference?
There was one crucial difference from her Indian counterparts, though. When Singh, meeting Thatcher soon after she had become Prime Minister, whispered, “Our man was proved right,” her reaction surprised him.
Only democracy could have engineered such remarkable change with the consent of the governed, and enabled all to feel that they have the same stake in the country’s progress, equal rights under its laws, and equal opportunities for advancement.
But the complacency with which the political establishment accepts the disruption of Parliament suggests that even experienced politicians do not understand this.
India has never seemed likely to succumb to a similar tendency, but the irresponsible custodians of Indian democracy should not tempt fate.
Five years ago, India’s lunar mission, called Chandrayaan, was the occasion for another national celebration.
Yet, unavoidably, some triumphalism has crept into the narrative.
The Great War’s Forgotten Soldiers
They were killed in droves before the war entered its second year, and they bore the brunt of many German offensives.
The soldiers were all volunteers; soldiering was their profession, and they served the very British Empire that was oppressing their own people back home.
The British have been flocking to an exhibition showcasing Indian troops’ role; the French are making a film about the brown-skinned and turbaned men who fought to save their land from the Germans; and, in India, curiosity has overcome the fading colonial-era resentment of British exploitation.
NEW DELHI – The victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its leader, Narendra Modi, in India’s general election last month has raised a crucial question about the country’s future.
This is where critics deem the Congress party to have failed, focusing as it did on the needs of India’s poorest.
The alleged handouts empowered those with the least to stand on their own feet and seek to improve their lives.
India’s Democratic Pageant
Yet there are larger issues behind the electoral spectacle that must not be overlooked.
The significant changes in the social composition of India’s politicians and bureaucrats since Independence are indeed proof of democracy at work.
As the victors in May cobble together a government, their challenge will be to sustain a pluralist India of competing ideas and interests, unafraid of the power or products of the outside world, and determined to liberate and fulfill its people’s creative energies.
India’s mild-mannered Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that Khobragade’s treatment was “deplorable.”
Likewise, the police have removed bollards and barriers that the US Embassy had unilaterally placed on the street in front of its complex in New Delhi, creating an obstacle to free circulation on a public road that India had tolerated in a spirit of friendship.
In almost no other country are local labor laws applied in such a manner to a foreign diplomat’s personal staff.
India had handled American diplomats with a generosity of spirit that it felt the bilateral relationship deserved.
The principal obstacle to peace has been Pakistan’s sponsorship of militancy and terrorism within India, culminating in the horrific attacks in Mumbai in November 2008, in which terrorist commandos killed almost 200 people.
Singh sat down with Sharif after a series of incidents on the LoC led his critics to urge him not to proceed with the meeting.
The benefits of peace, for both sides, would be enormous.
A Taliban victory there, the advocates of the surge had warned, would radicalize the entire region and create a domino effect, with Islamic insurgencies unleashed across Central Asia.
Pakistan’s macabre association with the Taliban stems mostly from its constant effort to pressure its mortal enemy, India.
So, while the US gets to play the “Ugly American” once again, the regional powers promote their interests in that war-torn country with a smiling face and away from the battlefield.
If both war and diplomacy fail, these regional powers believe they will be better positioned than the West to shift the Afghan Great Game in their favor.
With a shrinking labor force, the standard estimate for Japan in 2012 –&#160;that is, before Abenomics – had output per employed worker growing by 3.08% year on year.
Kuroda’s stance has already weakened the yen’s exchange rate, making Japanese goods more competitive.
The real challenge will be in designing the third arrow, what Abe refers to as “growth.”
For example, Japan is in a good position to exploit synergies between an improved health-care sector and its world-class manufacturing capabilities, in the development of medical instrumentation.



Indeed, I believe that a framework under which Asian governments publicly disclose their military budgets needs to be established if we are to build trust and avoid a regional arms race.
No less important, when Japan sends hardware, experts and training follow, and we convey our sense of pride in committing ourselves to our duties.
The JSDF is now working to foster peace in South Sudan, under the flag of the UN mission there, alongside units from Cambodia, Mongolia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, the Republic of Korea, and China, as well as many civilian UN staffers and NGO personnel from various countries. All are partners with us in assisting South Sudan’s nation-building process.
If anything has changed, it is that women are much more visible among these new Japanese.
Mr. Abe Goes to Washington
In America’s view, the reinterpretation of Article 9 of Japan’s “peace constitution” that Abe undertook – thereby allowing Japan’s self-defense forces to aid allies under attack and to assist the US and other allies in meeting their commitments to securing Asia’s peace – was long overdue.
Japan in Action
But, following monetary easing and fiscal expansion, it is Abenomics’ third “arrow” that will prove most important – and most politically challenging.
Japanese diplomacy lost its footing in the unstable – and often naive – politics of the DPJ years.
TOKYO – As Shinzo Abe sits down this week in Seoul with South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, he does so as the leader of a country that many people around the world now seriously underestimate.
Its economy remains the world’s third largest overall, sustained by highly sophisticated industry.
Both are suspicious of Abe, who exacerbated tensions with nationalist rhetoric and a visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine early in his current administration.
In addition, he hopes to use the recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to force reform of the inefficient agriculture sector.
Japan is a successful, comfortable society, which has much to contribute to the world.
Abe also stressed his intention to boost ties with Russia, promote cooperation with the ASEAN countries, and develop a strategic dialogue with Australia and India.
Furthermore, Abe will seek to reorganize the prime minister’s office to reinforce its ability to function as a political headquarters that can make quick decisions on national strategy concerning diplomatic and security issues.
If Abe is to create the “beautiful country” that he promised in his policy speech, he must not lose momentum in exercising strong leadership.
It is not that Abe’s 2012 campaign lacked ambition; he set out a bold economic-reform agenda and promised to boost Japan’s global influence. But, after two decades of leaders who – with the exception of Junichiro Koizumi – promised little and achieved less, Japanese voters had little reason to expect that Abe would follow through on his pledges.
Beyond his economic strategy, Abe has also delivered in terms of foreign policy.
If the Japanese public returns him to office, he will have the mandate he needs to complete his ambitious, pragmatic, and forward-thinking agenda. It is now up to the Japanese people to give him that mandate, effectively choosing to end two decades of economic malaise and geopolitical irrelevance.

इनमें से एक है हमारा ट्रैक रिकॉर्ड, जो "शांति के लिए सक्रिय योगदानकर्ता" होने की हमारी महत्वाकांक्षाओं का समर्थन करता है। जापान ने संयुक्त राष्ट्र और उसके संगठनों को वित्तीय योगदान अपने उचित हिस्से से कहीं अधिक किया है, ऐतिहासिक और वर्तमान दोनों दृष्टियों से। और हमारा वैश्विक उत्तरदायित्वों का विस्तार जापान की आत्म-रक्षा सेनाओं तक व्याप्त है। आत्म-रक्षा सेनाओं के सदस्यों ने 2011 में पूर्व जापान में आए भारी भूकंप के समय, अमेरिका और ऑस्ट्रेलिया की सशस्त्र सेनाओं के साथ अनुकरणीय सहयोग प्रदर्शित किया, और उन्हें हैती, इंडोनेशिया, और हाल ही में फ़िलीपीन्स में, जहाँ कहीं भी तैनात किया गया उन्होंने भारी प्रशंसा और सम्मान अर्जित किया है।
The modern states of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon thus arose as separate, independent entities.
Iraq today is not the unitary Arab nation-state that it was, and it is doubtful whether that state can be restored.
The emergence, after a prolonged and bloody civil war, of an independent South Sudan in 2011, freed the local Christian and animist population from the Arab/Muslim yoke.
Whereas secularism in the West arose with the emergence of liberal and democratic forces inspired by the Enlightenment, in the Muslim Middle East it has always been imposed by authoritarian rulers: the Shah in Iran, Atatürk in Turkey, Saddam in Iraq, Assad in Syria, and Nasser and Mubarak in Egypt.
Western statesmen are right to congratulate themselves on averting an immediate major crisis.
Instead, it considers every issue separately, unsure about how to balance its role as a global power with its commitment to liberal values, and led by a president who apparently believes that soaring rhetoric is a substitute for strategic thinking.
Of course, it is not easy to support a military coup against a democratically elected president (even one who, like Morsi, undermines the democratic values and institutions that brought him to power).
A rudderless US foreign policy is no response to a resurgent and neo-authoritarian Russia flexing its geopolitical muscle.
Jerusalem’s Arab population – which already accounts for more than 40% of the total – is growing by 3.5% annually, compared to 1.5% among Israelis.
Unsurprisingly, the 200,000 members of Israel’s liberal and prosperous middle class that abandoned the city in the last 20 years find Tel Aviv – Israel’s economic capital, and a center of technology-driven growth – far more appealing.
A Jerusalem controlled by non-productive Orthodox Jewish communities and disenfranchised Palestinians is destined for economic and political collapse.
For its part, the US has shifted substantial military power toward Asia – with high-profile military deployments in Australia and the Philippines, and 60% of America’s naval capabilities now deployed in the region – and has enhanced its defense ties with Japan and South Korea.
It is relatively content with Japan being a US security protectorate, because it fears the alternative: a Japan that expands its independent military reach.
China understands that, for now, US strategic primacy is an immutable reality.
Before China and the US overstep each other’s boundaries, they should abandon the concepts of “primacy” and “containment” in favor of a concert of Asian powers capable of resolving their differences.
But the failure to achieve this goal is precisely where the superior power is defeated in asymmetrical conflicts.
Contrary to what Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu believes, the main existential threat facing the country is not a nuclear-armed Iran.
It would also entail lifting the blockade and opening Gaza to the world.
TEL AVIV – Israel’s latest war in Gaza has echoed through Europe’s capitals in a powerful and destructive way.
But it does not even approach other humanitarian crises of recent decades, including those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
The hypocrisy of some of Israel’s critics in no way vindicates its colonial encroachment on Palestinian space, which makes it the last developed, “Western” country occupying and manhandling a non-Western people.
Jewish persecution, and the way that Zionism has employed it, has become a model for Palestinian nationalism.
The Middle East has long confronted the US with formidable challenges, which ultimately exceeded America’s imperial capacities and sapped public support.
Moreover, America’s Asian pivot is occurring at a time when its international credibility has been badly eroded by domestic political dysfunction and disappointing performance in the Middle East.
China’s exports to the Middle East are already more than twice those of the US.
It was born, after all, in the wake of the first Gulf War, and was facilitated by the regional consequences of the Cold War’s end.
The anarchy along Israel’s borders is becoming a breeding ground for Sunni extremists for whom the Jewish state is the ultimate enemy.
Recognizing the “Jewish state” would be a betrayal of the constituent ethos of Palestinian nationalism, while intrusive security arrangements would be a standing invitation to radical groups to fight what would be seen as occupation in disguise.
But Netanyahu’s school of thought is radically different.
While the US remains an indispensable global actor, it is no longer willing to use coercive diplomacy in its quest to build a new order.
Diplomatic ripening sometimes requires the mediator to be a manipulator and an arm-twister.
Within this new peace paradigm, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would become amenable to a truly international solution.
The initiators of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative understood this; perhaps now the US will come to appreciate it as well.
The same is true of antidepressants. 
Where is the concern about the millions who are becoming physically dependent on antidepressants? Where are the protests about the one-year-olds being treated with antipsychotic drugs?
Nominal interest rates – quoted in terms of dollars, euros, renminbi, etc. – are difficult to interpret, since the real cost of borrowing at these rates depends on the future course of inflation, which is always unknown.
Notably, the issuer, that is the borrower, can rationally plan such borrowing to make real investments.
The low level of real interest rates does not appear to be due to the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
This would be an opportune time for governments to issue more inflation-indexed debt, to begin issuing it, or to issue nominal GDP-linked debt, which is analogous to it.
Bondholders were saved because governments generally chose to infuse cash in exchange for common or preferred shares – which are subordinate to bondholders’ claims – or to improve balance sheets by buying or guaranteeing the value of assets.
Indeed, the need to compensate bondholders for risks could provide market discipline: when financial firms operate in ways that can be expected to produce increased risks down the road, they should expect to “pay” with, say, higher interest rates or tighter conditions.
In other words, governments should establish bailout policies before the need to intervene arises, rather than make ad hoc decisions when financial firms get into trouble.
The pediatric trial data released by the MHRA presented a unique opportunity to examine whether the unpublished data supported the findings from published studies of SSRI’s.
The problem is widespread and not restricted to drug companies.
Should China be “Contained”?
With the end of the Cold War, the containment of the Soviet Union ushered in by Kissinger’s visit could no longer serve as the basis for US-China relations.
Clinton also began to improve relations with India, a strategy that has enjoyed bipartisan support in the US.
Such fears appear exaggerated, particularly when one considers that Asia is not one entity.
The US and China (as well as other countries) have much to gain from collaborating on transnational issues.
Crunch time is fast approaching.
The new German political party would attract much more support, and sentiment might shift.
The entrenchment of debtor-creditor relationships between the states of the eurozone would fuel political tension – as occurred in the United States in its first decades.
Franco-German reconciliation, the greatest success of the postwar period in Europe, would be in jeopardy.
Even more important are the argument’s economic flaws, three of which are immediately apparent.
The result is often a wage-price spiral that quickly offsets the competitiveness gains of a weaker currency.
Finally, proponents of a German exit claim that the eurozone in its current form is deeply flawed (although they usually are reluctant to provide details regarding exactly how).
This system could persist only through sustained public borrowing.
Is it too late to prevent a showdown?
Moreover, there are genuine fears that rogue elements in a divided Iranian government might leak weapons technology to terrorist groups.
Moreover, Iran’s support of terrorist organizations, such as Hezbollah, could bring violence to other countries.
Today, the diplomatic package consists mostly of penalties, albeit the small ones of targeted sanctions.
Mittal, the biggest steelmaker in the world, has successfully gained control of Arcelor, the second biggest, through what initially was a hostile takeover bid.
It tightens costs, and outsources work as much as possible, so its workforce is paid less than Arcelor’s employees and is less stable. Moreover, Arcelor represented a perfect takeover target: most of its capital belongs to diverse shareholders.
But the shareholders of Arcelor have made their choice.
Indeed, in reality, the company is a community of men and women who draw their incomes from the same economic and technical venture.
Various critics are seizing on such statements as evidence that the Fed is incompetent, and that its independence should be curtailed, or worse.
But that does not impugn the whole FOMC, much less the entire institution.
The idea was to save the financial system from having to deal with safely dismantling the impossibly complex contractual edifices – which did not allow for the possibility of systemic collapse – that it had constructed.
Were concerns mounting at the Fed as well in the summer of 2008? We will have to wait until next year to find out.
“It is the violence that keeps us here,” he said. “It is the peace that allows us to go.”
Kurdish politicians within the new parliament have good reason to protect these lucrative deals as debate begins over constitutional changes.
But attacks in Iraq’s “Sunni triangle” (and Baghdad in particular) occur at a rate rivaling those in Chechnya and the Niger Delta.
As a result, any attempt at decisive military intervention would be not only difficult, but also extremely risky.
But the US and the West cannot leave the matter entirely to others or confine their efforts to the United Nations, where Russia and China prevent any effective action.
To meet these criteria would require convening interested countries in order to gain greater insight into both internal Syrian and regional implications of military action.
But the sheer complexity of conditions in Syria means that the regime’s endgame could trigger a transition unlike any other in the Arab Spring, different in both its domestic course and in its effects on the region.
In an interview in the London Sunday Times , he was quoted as saying that he was gloomy about Africa’s prospects, because “All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really.”
What does raise the suspicion of racism, however, is propagating a negative view of the facts when that view lacks a solid scientific foundation.
The dangers are obvious enough.
In explaining why it was canceling Watson’s lecture, the Science Museum said that his remarks had gone “beyond the point of acceptable debate.”
Recently, some unusual research has raised new questions about the role of intuitive responses in ethical reasoning.
The only way you can prevent the trolley from killing five people is by pushing this large stranger off the footbridge, in front of the trolley.
Greene found that people asked to make a moral judgment about “personal” violations, like pushing the stranger off the footbridge, showed increased activity in areas of the brain associated with the emotions.
On the contrary, these findings should make us more skeptical about relying on our intuitions.
The Kyoto Protocol was a major achievement, yet it left out 75% of the sources of emissions: the US, the largest polluter, refused to sign.
The timing of the conference is not propitious.
Giving emission allowances is like giving away money – potentially hundreds of billions of dollars.
Moreover, Europe has grown used to the concept of cap-and-trade, and many are loathe to try an alternative. Yet, no one has proposed an acceptable set of principles for assigning emission rights.
Hope Amid the Middle East’s Turmoil
Against all the odds, Yemen is undergoing a process of political transformation, with 500 delegates from all parts of society working on plans for democracy, justice, and equality.
Meanwhile, with a genuinely inclusive and objectively administered constitution, Egypt could pivot back toward democracy.
Evolution, if attainable, is clearly preferable.
A functioning private sector that creates adequate jobs, and schools that educate the large young population for today’s inter-connected world, are prerequisites of progress.
The entire world has a massive interest in where these threads lead.
Of course, without universal and coordinated international political, economic, and media support for these brave monks, all development in Burma may quickly be put back nearly 20 years.
But giving up is not an option.
Mexican homeowners who install energy-saving systems such as solar water heaters are becoming eligible for lower-rate “green mortgages.”
Many countries and companies are forging ahead, signaling a determination not to be held hostage by the slowest at the official negotiating table.
Of course, not every country approaches innovation in the same way.
Beyond its own specific objectives, the initiative can help to catalyze a broader transformation of the Dutch tech culture.
LONDON – If Socrates’s gadfly was in Silicon Valley, it would have a lot of lazy horses to sting.
As the world looks to Silicon Valley and sees an echo chamber of self-righteous conceit, mature and law-abiding technology companies are assumed to be inside it, too.
Much of Silicon Valley’s success stems from its tight networks – people who have been successful and support one another.
Ironically, questioning prevailing wisdom – and thereby inventing radically new solutions – has been Silicon Valley’s modus operandi from the outset.
CAMBRIDGE – During the last decades of the twentieth century, Silicon Valley was the unparalleled epicenter of high-tech innovation.
For the first time, “unicorns” (startups that reach a valuation of more than $1 billion) are no longer the exclusive preserve of the United States – a reality that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
Speaking at Stanford University’s 2013 commencement, he quipped, “I believe that more and more Stanford graduates will find themselves moving to Silicon Alley, not only because we’re the hottest new tech scene in the country, but also because there’s more to do on a Friday night than go to the Pizza Hut in Sunnyvale.
Before long, the digital world and the physical world will be indistinguishable.
But, just like Cricket Australia, the message is clear: There will be no change to business as usual.
A $13 billion “fine” for a company the size of JPM is about as painful as Clarke’s fine is for him – not painful at all.
Marianne Lake, JP Morgan’s chief financial officer, has suggested that about $7 billion of the fine is likely to be tax deductible, that is, treated as a form of necessary and usual business expense.
WASHINGTON, DC – The banking system has become most central bankers’ Achilles’ heel.
José De Gregorio, the governor of the Central Bank of Chile from 2007 to 2011, is an important exception.
This benefited Chile – a major copper producer – and much of Latin America.
In a boom, this may seem irrelevant; but, as De Gregorio knows, pressure on emerging markets – and richer countries – arises all too often, and frequently at unexpected moments.
In many countries, people on the right of the political spectrum provide a bastion of support for the central bank.
The main problem is that the Fed has not moved with alacrity to implement fully key provisions of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which were passed in 2010.
With that much leverage, it does not take a lot to create fear of insolvency.
With the Tea Party wing of America’s Republican Party scaring investors out of the dollar, interest in the Chinese renminbi’s potential as an international reserve currency can only increase.
Banking has become an instrument of economic policy to ensure GDP growth and employment creation, while keeping inflation at an acceptable level.
Can the BoE – and the UK Treasury – really provide downside insurance for this full amount, or are the UK authorities set on the path to becoming another Iceland (where the value of bank assets peaked at more than 11 times the country’s GDP)?
(The precise numbers are different in other industrialized countries, but the rise of finance is a general phenomenon.)
The question is no longer so much one of beliefs.
With the exception of the United Kingdom, the extreme free-market view gained less traction in Europe in recent decades than it did in the US; nonetheless, the challenge of implementing financial reforms in the eurozone is actually more difficult.
The first, heard mostly from executives at leading global banks and their allies, is that the system is safer than it has ever been.
Bank regulators are starting to take these issues more seriously – an encouraging change from the 1990s and early 2000s, when the Fed was among the cheerleaders for unfettered financial innovation, without adequate consideration for systemic risk.
This needs to be done as a technical matter, not as part of the political process.
Two Views of Finance
“Banks will need to hold more capital” is a common refrain, describing efforts by regulators – and, in the United States, some legislators – to require that financial institutions fund themselves with relatively more equity and less debt.
(Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig have pointed out that there are many misperceptions in this area; but, of these, misconstruing capital is surely the most fundamental.)
We need these firms to be able to fail without causing a global panic.
The costs are likely to be far higher than they were in 1814.
Those details – for example, in Admati’s recent testimony to the Senate subcommittee chaired by Brown – are not in doubt.
The GAO report also refers to the Dodd-Frank financial reforms of 2010, including the requirement that large bank holding companies create “living wills.”
How to Become an Oligarch
But a new book, Private Equity at Work, by Eileen Appelbaum and Rosemary Batt, explains exactly how a few people have become immensely rich through the shrewd strategic use of debt.
Most of it is raised from outside investors.
However, before graduates flock to private equity, they should know that only the very big funds can use debt to skew returns for insiders in this way, primarily because only they can raise the capital needed to buy well-established companies that are rich in fixed assets, and thus in potential collateral.
That sounds bad.
But that is why it is good to be big – you can get more downside protection from the Federal Reserve or other official sources.
The most prominent example is money-market mutual funds. These entities take money from investors and buy various kinds of assets, some of which may be risky – like short-maturity corporate debt.
The third set of shadow activities includes those that may yet emerge.
The Ukrainian crisis may prove helpful, though that appears less likely now – which may be a good thing to the extent that one unintended consequence could be a loan to Ukraine that is larger than it really needs.
In the highly charged partisan atmosphere of Washington, DC, this is without question almost always an advantage.
These countries’ global economic and financial significance has grown rapidly, yet they have relatively little representation at the Fund.
What Ukraine needs is a sharp reduction in corruption, as well as real legitimacy (through the ballot box) for people who want to rein in the influence of oligarchs – a group that has sapped the economy through plunder and incompetence over the past two decades.
It appears to ease depression’s most severe symptoms within minutes or hours, even in patients who have a dismal track record with other treatments.
But, though ketamine’s promise has stirred excitement among clinicians and neuroscientists, it has also sparked controversy, owing to the drug’s potentially harmful side effects.
In fact, ketamine’s future as a therapy for depression would be uncertain even if its efficacy were more strongly established.
The so-called “neocolonialist school,” popular among China skeptics, considers China’s economic relationship with Africa as essentially imperial.
This is a serious accusation, given that one of the big attractions of foreign direct investment is local job creation.
Finally, there is the argument that Chinese FDI fails to transfer technologies and skills to local businesses – what economists refer to as “positive spillovers.”
This could encourage investment in a range of higher-value-added sectors, promote positive spillovers, and minimize adverse effects.
Jihadis have exploited the security void created by last year’s revolution to reinforce their presence in Sinai.
When the guns fell silent following the two countries’ 1973 war, Egypt stopped viewing Israel as a threat.
The government’s counter-terrorism policies also work against an enhanced military role in quashing the Sinai jihadis.
Turkey’s Iran Strategy
First, they interpret the deal as vindication of their ill-fated effort in May 2010 (together with Brazil) to reach an agreement with Iran on the disposition of Iran’s nuclear fuel.
As a result, Turkey’s export potential has been negatively affected by the rising stringency of the sanctions regime against Iran, with trade losses estimated at $6 billion for the first nine months of 2013.
ISTANBUL – Turkey’s beleaguered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) have emerged victorious from this week’s local elections.
With the AKP’s overwhelming triumph in the local elections, Erdoğan can now justifiably claim that the Turkish electorate backs his approach, including his government’s suspension of the rule of law in order to obstruct corruption investigations that it views as a judicial coup attempted by Gülen’s followers.
Long gone are the days when the prospect of accession to the European Union sustained a powerful dynamic of democratic reform.
If Erdoğan believes that a higher level of antagonism is necessary to retain power, he may remain oblivious to the harm done to Turkey’s international standing.
For a thousand years, states have regulated maritime transportation for the purpose of promoting safety at sea.
This valuation may not constitute the full amount of damages that the heirs of those who have died as a result of a crime or a breach of contract may eventually recover.
As a consequence, they settle for the crumbs that are eventually offered by the ship owners after a disaster.
Indeed, the list of disappointments pre-dates Israeli statehood and the Nakbeh itself: the King-Crane Commission of 1919, the 1937 Peel Report, the British White Paper of 1939, the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry of 1945, and the UN Partition Plan of 1947.
Writing in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs , Shirl McArthur, a retired US Foreign Service officer, estimates that direct US aid to Israel between 1949 and 2006 totaled $108 billion.
Sleepwalking in the Balkans
This toxic interaction is at the heart of today's Bosnian crisis.
Like Dodik, Russia is exploiting weak EU resolve, making trouble for the US and EU where possible.
Slouching Toward Gaza
But Hamas’s brinkmanship is a dangerous exercise, for a low-intensity conflict can easily degenerate into an all-out flare-up if its rockets cause a politically unbearable number of casualties on the Israeli side.
Indeed, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader, might be ready to pay a high political price during an electoral season by accepting even a new lull that is intermittently violated by Hamas.
Slouching Toward Sanity
Nationalizing Fannie and Freddie, and using them to peg the price of mortgages, would have been the cleanest and easiest way to accomplish that.
Opponents of recent economic policy rebel against the hypothesis that an absence of government intervention and support could produce an economic decline of that magnitude today.
It is a pattern that has caused real damage, because overoptimistic forecasts delay measures that are needed to boost growth, and thus impede full economic recovery.
In economies with excess capacity (including human capital) and a high degree of structural flexibility, the multipliers are greater than once thought.
It is equally unclear what will happen to asset prices when monetary assistance is withdrawn.
Labor markets have been knocked out of equilibrium as new technology and shifting global supply chains have caused demand in the labor market to change faster than supply can adjust.
Slumdog Oscar
Exuberant, exciting, gaudy, and gritty in a way that can only be called Dickensian, Slumdog Millionaire brings contemporary Mumbai to life from the seamy side up, and it does so with brio, compassion, and all-round cinematic excellence.
This may reveal something of Boyle’s view of human nature, but most Indian viewers know they live in a land largely devoid of larger-than-life heroes.
Small Economies, Big Problems, and Global Interdependence
If CDSs are concentrated in particular financial institutions, these institutions could be at risk – more so than the primary purchasers of Greek debt themselves.
One can find other examples of this kind.
As these examples indicate, however, systemic importance is not just a question of size.
As a result, global corn, wheat, and soybean prices rose in July and August, and remain high.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development sees enormous potential in Africa’s agricultural sector, which experienced 4.8% growth in 2009, compared to 3.8% in the Asia-Pacific region and only 1.4% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
We should consider not only how to improve the ability of smallholder farmers to grow food; we also must strengthen their ability to participate in markets, while improving the way those markets function.
In September, the world’s 193 governments will meet at the United Nations in New York to agree on a set of global targets that will direct these resources.
Many others generate only slightly more than a dollar per dollar spent.
More than two billion people carry the TB bacterium, and at some point about 10% of them will develop the disease, which kills some 1.5 million victims per year (compared to 20,000 dead in the recent Ebola outbreak).
Focusing on coral reefs turns out to be a surprisingly efficient target.
This would mean $1,000 more for each person in the developing world every year, and would lift a staggering 160 million people out of poverty.
As the debate shifts from austerity towards measures aimed at stimulating growth, smarter taxation will be essential to getting the balance right.
Conventional taxes raise revenue, but pose a much greater risk of depressing growth in the process.
Given Europe’s fiscal deficits and the economic impact of reducing them, that is a huge potential prize.
Fortunately, recent research points to a smarter way to tackle climate change.
Cambridge University Press is publishing their research and findings this month, under the title Smart Solutions to Climate Change.
The reason is simple.
To ensure that we have enough time to conduct the necessary R&amp;D, we should step up our commitment to research into climate-engineering technology.
Had the American people chosen John F. Kerry over George W. Bush last November, the reunion would be seen by both sides as a new beginning, resonant with personal warmth.
If the negotiations should fail, the transatlantic cleavage could once again become glaringly wide.
The drafters of the farewell communiqué are, no doubt, already at work listing all the issues on which the two governments see eye to eye.
What could revive that habit? Perhaps only a miracle: real progress in the Israel-Palestine conflict, which both the US and the Europeans could then claim to have helped bring about.
The US accuses China of using cyber espionage to steal intellectual property on an unprecedented scale.
Some of America’s allies, now professing outrage at disclosures of US spying, have been known to do the same thing to the US.
In terms of civil liberties, examining the content of a message from a suspect non-American source is less controversial.
Rather than demonstrating hypocrisy and acceptance of the erosion of civil liberties, the Snowden disclosures have provoked a debate that suggests the US is living up to its democratic principles in its traditionally untidy ways.
Particularly in developed economies, social policies must adjust to provide the support that lower-income groups need, while encouraging growth and advancing wellbeing.
The startup Handy hopes that its app achieves similar success in connecting customers to independent contractors providing various household services.
The main difference between the progressive vision of a society underpinned by these “citizen accounts” and the conservative idea that individual citizens should create personal retirement accounts, take out student loans, or cover their own health insurance is the public sector’s role.
To be sure, this approach will not magically resolve all of the challenges countries currently face.
In Brazil, Chile and Uruguay, social democracy is proving that it can work.
Indeed, despite the government’s successes, there could be a change, as the Partido Nacional of the center-right bloc is now running neck-and-neck with the FA.
The Urban Village
A growing body of evidence suggests that similar functions govern even more aspects of urban life than the research by West’s team indicated.
A recent paper (of which one of us, Carlo Ratti, is a co-author) uses anonymized data from telecommunications networks across Europe to explore how human networks change with city size.
What computational social science offers is the prospect of quantifying such observations and gaining insights that could shape the design of urban environments in the future.
Unfortunately, not enough attention is being paid to the link between these two key issues.
As it stands, Social Security and Medicare are unsustainable, with the long-term gap between projected income and promised benefits reaching tens of trillions of dollars – well in excess of the official debt the federal government has accumulated over its history.
Seniors working past the retirement age of 67 should not be subject to the payroll tax, and the retirement earnings test should be eliminated, so that seniors can work full-time without losing out on Social Security benefits.
With so few presidential candidates recognizing the link between reforming Social Security and Medicare and ensuring broadly shared prosperity, the US faces serious risks.
In 2000, the world’s governments adopted the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which aim to halve global poverty by 2015.
To tackle global problems, we need to strengthen and democratize international institutions like the United Nations.
Mass migration from poor countries has created fear and xenophobia in richer countries, especially among the working class.
Empowering citizens means giving them both the power to decide and the knowledge to decide well.
Russians, for example, rejected Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a clownish Donald Trump-like nationalist and anti-Semite, in favor of Boris Yeltsin, who had stared down tanks during the failed 1991 coup and recognized that his country’s future lay with democracy and the West.
One cause for this shift toward authoritarianism is that many countries no longer view the United States as a beacon of democracy and a model of stability and prosperity to be emulated.
Citizens seem convinced.
Putin’s efforts to reclaim “great power” status for Russia may find support among his people; but that support will probably dwindle if Russians face the prospect of losing all of the comforts derived from the relatively open economy that their country has had for more than two decades.
At the supranational level, the new European Commission is pursuing its goal of “better regulation” using as little formal lawmaking as possible, focusing instead on recommendations, codes of conduct, and guidelines.
It is simply more difficult for 193 states to reach agreement than it was for the original 51 signatories of the post-World War II conventions that established the contemporary international order.
This year will offer one more critical opportunity to reestablish hard legality in international negotiations: the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December.
World leaders need a success story to get them motivated.
Maybe that’s really how it is.
This year it is monks in Tibet.
I hope that this issue does not derail the Chinese effort to use the Olympics as an opportunity to show the world that their country has emerged again as one of the world’s leaders.
This is super-charged American soft power.
Faced with the embarrassment of his pastor’s views on race and on America, Obama did not go into a huddle with spin-doctors to fathom how he should deal with the problem.
That is what my children would call a “no brainer.”
He is correct, up to a point.
The US is more powerful than any country since the Roman Empire, but like Rome, America is neither invincible nor invulnerable.
The war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations - Islam versus the West - but a civil war within Islamic civilization between extremists who use violence to enforce their vision and a moderate majority who want things like jobs, education, health care, and dignity as they pursue their faith.
In 2003, a bipartisan advisory group reported that the US was spending only $150 million on public diplomacy in Muslim countries, an amount it called grossly inadequate.
Tidak diragukan lagi perkembangan ini bagus untuk perjuangan melawan perubahan iklim.
Selain itu, karena pembangkit listrik tenaga surya umumnya dapat dioperasikan secara terpisah dari jaringan listrik interregional yang kompleks, maka mereka menciptakan cara bagi negara yang kurang berkembang untuk menghasilkan listrik tanpa membangun infrastruktur baru yang mahal.
Studi yang dilakukan Fraunhofer Institute menunjukkan bahwa selisih dalam pengeluaran modal (capex) sama pentingnya bagi biaya per kilowat-jam dengan selisih pada cahaya matahari.
All of these were great and noble qualities, and all of them now seem utterly superfluous to most Poles.
Political apathy reflects many factors, but two stand out.
Unsurprisingly, the young are the most estranged.
But that a third of all children in a member country of the European Union live on one meal a day is a source of shame – and thus should also be a primary political issue.
For the problems of anomie, apathy, and political charade are not Polish problems, but maladies that increasingly afflict democracies everywhere, and that urgently call for a restoring of faith in parties and politics.
One is to hark back to older modes of solidarity.
Indeed, the utter lack of a sense of solidarity among so many people – horrifyingly evident in the US health-care debate – is now undermining the very basis of what a modern democratic society is.
This can succeed only if we engage in vigorous exchange with each other in order to create a kind of mutual respect for these different views.
But the scale of the disaster facing Japan is so monumental that it demands our help.
It is time for all of us, not just in our professional capacities, but also as individuals, to turn our thoughts and actions to those affected.

इसी तरह, नगरों द्वारा यूनिट के आकार की अपेक्षाओं जैसे भूमि के उपयोग संबंधी प्रतिबंधों में ढील दी जा सकती है, ताकि उच्च-घनत्व वाली, और इस प्रकार अधिक मूल्यवान, परियोजनाओं के लिए अनुमति दी जा सके। अचल संपत्ति के डेवलपरों को अधिक मूल्य प्रदान करने की एवज में, नगर निगम के अधिकारियों द्वारा यह शर्त लगाई जा सकती है कि भूमि के एक अंश या एक निश्चित संख्या में इकाइयों को किफायती आवास के लिए निर्धारित किया जाए। इस तरह की क्रॉस-सब्सिडी से विभिन्न आय वर्गों के लिए आवास की आपूर्ति में वृद्धि होगी और इससे जनता पर कोई सीधी लागत भी नहीं आएगी।
साथ ही, नगर निगम डेवलपरों के लिए वित्तपोषण की लागतों को कम करने के लिए किफायती इकाइयों की खरीद को प्रतिबद्ध करके या योग्य किरायेदारों की गारंटी देकर परियोजनाओं को "जोखिम-रहित" बना सकते हैं। नगर निर्माण कार्यों को तेज़ी से पूरा करने के लिए अनुमोदन प्रक्रियाओं को भी सरल बना सकते हैं।
Kapal-kapal asing yang menggunakan pukat dasar (bottom trawl) melakukan penangkapan ikan yang tidak bertanggung jawab dan bertindak berdasarkan impunitas, menyeret jaring-jaring berukuran besar, menghancurkan dasar laut dan merusak habitat laut yang vital seluas 120.000 kilometer persegi (46.000 mil persegi).
Bahkan, hampir setengah dari perikanan yang kita kelola saat ini tengah dieksploitasi pada tingkatan yang berkelanjutan. Tetapi kita memerlukan investasi lebih besar untuk perbaikan infrastruktur untuk mewujudkan potensi industri secara maksimal.
According to the most recent United Nations figures, 400,000 people, or roughly one-third of Mogadishu’s population, have fled the city.
The same lack of security applies to delivering aid: on a recent visit to North Somalia to assess humanitarian needs, a team from the International Rescue Committee of which I was a part spent more time, effort, and funds on security issues than on inspecting wells and evaluating the need for latrines, although the lack of water and sanitation is acute.
If only such practices were used to tackle the vast majority of the problems that overwhelm Somalia.
But if the government is to succeed and prevent further violence, Kenya must tackle the roots of its election chaos.
The organization—which claims one million members—is guilty of horrific acts of violence that continue unabated, including the recent beheading of the son of one of Kibaki’s key allies.
The state then brutally crushes the militias, making matters worse, and politicians manipulate the actors for their own purposes.
Of course, Sarkozy would be surprised to be told that the same logic should lead to a declaration of repentance by the French state to Algeria, not to mention to the Algerian soldiers who fought under the French banner, the so-called “Harkis,” many of whom were abandoned to a terrible fate when France left the country in a hurry.
To ask for forgiveness enables one to speak to the “Other” without ambiguity, with the freedom of speech needed to express truth. Indeed, former French President Jacques Chirac won a place in French history by proclaiming France’s responsibility for the crimes committed by the collaborationist Vichy government against its Jewish citizens during the Nazi occupation.
Repentance is not a sign of weakness. On the contrary, it is a demonstration of tranquil and conscientious strength – and a precondition of good and realistic governance.
And it rewards me if I delete them all by crossing that sender off the list (yes, I’m so easy to manipulate!).
The first rule is to have a clear, unique subject line – “follow-up re BioWorks, deadline Nov.
Busy people travel a lot and often check their email in trains, planes, and the WiFi-free countryside, where online access is limited.)
By contrast, most social-network email is not just unstructured, but almost actively obscure.
South Africa needs to reclaim the economic initiative, by – literally – building the Africa of the future.
South Africa is home to several well-established, innovative banks that are well placed to offer low-cost, digital services to millions of currently unbanked African households and businesses.
The key to reigniting South Africa’s economic growth is an ambitious regional strategy driven by government and business leaders working in partnership.
Together with President Nelson Mandela’s moral authority, this status helped the party to accommodate a wide range of interests and establish a stable economic order without losing the support of poor black voters, many of whom fell outside that order. Although supporters’ expectations were high, so was their patience – a dynamic reinforced by the ANC’s liberation mythology and early successes in expanding housing, electricity, and social grants.
Last year’s wave of wildcat strikes in the mining sector – which precipitated the infamous “Marikana massacre” – ended up shaving 0.5% off the country’s GDP growth in 2012.
Ramaphosa’s respectability will undoubtedly provide the party (and the scandal-plagued Zuma) with some badly needed cover.
The problem partly reflects a lack of consensus about the criteria that a judicial candidate must satisfy.
Over the last few weeks, we, as well as others, have sought to encourage the nomination of progressive judges to fill the Constitutional Court vacancy.
Women’s groups lose the right to complain about the lack of women on the bench if they fail to nominate women for vacant positions.
Anonymity was not their goal. They wanted to be identified as defenders of a cause.
In Afghanistan, Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies sought “strategic depth” against India. Moreover, they wanted payback for India’s role in supporting the revolt in the 1960’s and 1970’s that led to Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan.
In fact, it was even involved in rescue operations on the Pakistani side of Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake there.
Militants of all stripes must be decommissioned completely and transparently.
China knows that, under international law, its claim to sovereignty over virtually all of the resource-endowed South China Sea, based on an “historic right,” is weak; that is why it has opposed international adjudication. Instead, it is trying to secure “effective control” – which, under international law, enhances significantly the legitimacy of a country’s territorial claim – just as it has done in the Himalayas and elsewhere.
Some already have.
So, is a US-China conflict in the South China Sea imminent?
But China did not avoid conflicts with its maritime neighbors.
If China claimed such a zone for each of the sites it occupies, it could close off most of the South China Sea. As one US official put it, China seems to be trying to “create facts on the ground” – what Admiral Harry Harris, the US commander in the Pacific, calls a new “great wall of sand.”
China’s Self-Destructive Maritime Strategy
And, although the US is not explicitly supporting the Philippines in the legal case it has brought to the United Nations asserting that China’s claims are illegal under the Convention on the Law of the Sea, the complaint clearly has the tacit backing of most of the Philippines’ allies.
This disparity represents an important opportunity for countries like the US and Japan, which are trying to discipline a delinquent China in the South China Sea by demonstrating their overwhelming naval power – and thus their capacity to deny China access to key sea-lanes.
But lately its economy has been faltering, with GDP growth averaging 3.6% for the last ten years – a significant drop from the 8.1% annual growth rate that prevailed in 1965-2005.
South Korea’s relationship with China perfectly illustrates the challenges it faces.
This will require reversing the sharp decline in the proportion of middle-income households, which is down to 67.5%, from 75.4% in 1990.
Stricter rules are needed to improve corporate governance and prevent unfair practices by those affiliated with the chaebols.
The challenge for South Korea stems from the inevitable tradeoff between legitimacy and workability.
Of course the pressure to expand is always irresistible.
I would favor articulation of the principle that the necessary concrete steps toward long-term fiscal consolidation in advanced countries – such as raising the retirement age or taking other steps today to reform public pensions – need not require premature withdrawal of current fiscal stimulus;
Fiscal stimulus turned out to be more widespread in 2009 than one might have guessed.
But the election may well have a more positive impact on the region as a whole.
Park avoided active politics for many years after her parents’ death, but later won a parliamentary seat.
And, although South Korea has slipped to 80th place in the IPU’s most recent rankings, the fall reflects subsequent growth in the proportion of female legislators in other countries.
Korea is not the first emerging market to chair the G-20, but it is the first to do so since the global financial crisis.
Given the nature and gravity of the crisis, it was brutally obvious what the priorities for the G-20 should be.
Progress here has been inadequate, despite much talk.
After all, no one anointed these 20 countries as the designated representatives of the world.
As chair, it needs to act as an “honest broker.”
If geography is destiny, South Korea was dealt a weak hand.
Sometimes, Koreans compare their country of 50 million to a neighbor like China or a superpower like the US and believe that they cannot compete with such giants.
Over the next half-century, South Korea became the world’s 11th largest economy, with per capita income reaching more than $15,000.
Korean popular culture has also crossed borders, particularly among younger people in neighboring Asian countries, while the impressive success of the Korean diaspora in the US has further enhanced the attractiveness of the culture and country from which they came.
China and South Korea need no introduction to each other, of course – such is the burden of history in the region.
Indeed, she was elected with a curious blend of support: right-wing backers of her father, Park Chung-hee, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1961 to 1979, and many other Koreans, including some on the left, who wanted someone different from the usual blue-suited, white-shirted Korean politician.
The Chinese will look at her carefully, and may well be sizing her up as an immediate neighbor should North Korea persist on its current course to total isolation and oblivion.
SINGAPORE – Can ten countries with different cultures, traditions, languages, political systems, and levels of economic development act in concert to expand their collective potential? That is the question with which the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been wrestling for decades.
By making exporting more efficient and less costly – up to 20% cheaper, in some sectors – a wide range of goods and services would become attainable for millions of new consumers. This could boost consumption across Southeast Asia, leading to a virtuous circle of growth.
ASEAN’s lower-income economies have expressed concern that they will miss out on many of the benefits of deeper integration.
MANILA &#45;&#45; Pakistan’s near political chaos, the result of President Pervez Musharraf’s declaration of martial law last year and the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, has had a tsunami-like impact across Southeast Asia.
Bin Laden’s most recent threats have been equally universal.
Recall a letter from the convicted terrorist Ramzi Yousef, which was found in his Islamabad safe house after he was arrested in February 1995.  
At the height of the Soviet-Afghanistan war in the 1980’s, Pakistan was the covert conduit for Filipino Muslim militants passing to and from Afghanistan and back to the island of Mindanao, which has long been a stronghold of Muslim rebels.
In addition to becoming more active in world diplomacy, Yudhoyono will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this month to discuss buying Russia’s newest fighter jets.
The possibility that Southeast Asia’s governments might begin to play America and China off against each other is one of the concerns that most animates the latest US quadrennial defense review, which is intended to “focus on the Pacific Ocean” in awareness of China’s growing naval power.
South Korea, too, has joined the scramble.
For those Asian countries that recall Japan’s moderate and sensible advancement of regional policies since the 1960’s, there is a growing expectation that Japan should re-think its stance.
Strong capital inflows, especially of foreign direct investment, and terms-of-trade recovery since 2009 have made the region less vulnerable to external shocks –&#160;that is, to recurrence of the abrupt capital-flow reversal that occurred in late 2008 and early 2009.
This policy stimulus led to strong growth, in both consumption and investment, and economic activity recovered quickly.
These measures, plus a reduction in tax revenues, should reduce the primary surplus and contribute to reviving demand.
In Argentina, the authorities’ battles with a small number of “investors” (so-called vulture funds) jeopardized an entire debt restructuring agreed to – voluntarily – by an overwhelming majority of the country’s creditors.
Has the country been put on a sustainable debt path? Too often, because the defenders of the status quo do not ask these questions, one debt crisis is followed by another.
That is why we find the claim by some – including the US Treasury – that there is no need for an international rule of law so incredible.
A “soft law” framework containing these features, implemented through an oversight commission that acted as a mediator and supervisor of the restructuring process, could resolve some of today’s inefficiencies and inequities.
That legal vacuum matters, because, as we now see in Greece and Puerto Rico, it can suck the life out of economies.
But some powerful actors would stop well short of establishing an international legal framework.
Yet all refuse to accept that the rationale for a domestic rule of law – including provisions to protect weak borrowers from powerful and abusive creditors – applies at the international level as well.
Debt restructuring is not a zero-sum game.
The government is investing in “micro” satellites, building on its existing SumbandilaSat platform.
McGruder, who works closely with African astronomers, agrees that a space program for the region is critical to raising the profile of careers in science and engineering in a part of the world where the most educated people still go into finance or management.
To be sure, South Africa’s push to join the world’s technological leaders is not limited to space research.
But all signs indicate that the month will end in doubt and pessimism.
The foundations of Spain’s current labor laws date to 1938, when the civil war was tearing the country apart.
Meanwhile, it distorts reality to view Spain’s entire banking sector through the prism of the cajas, the savings banks that are the soft underbelly of the Spanish financial system.
Spain’s soccer victory was not a fluke but the culmination of a long evolution to emerge as a winning machine from its Francoist furia española past.
But the heavy industries in which many were employed have now closed, and unemployment is widespread.
Yet this is not enough to reverse a rising tide of violence and discrimination, compounded by the recent economic recession.
In conjunction with the launch of the Decade of Roma Inclusion in 2005, my foundation network formed an alliance with the World Bank and transferred its Roma educational programs to a newly established Roma Education Fund.
If Spain leads the way, all of Europe will ultimately reap the benefits.
A second argument is that higher oil prices are due to lower interest rates and anticipations of higher long-term prices.
Indeed, the spike in oil prices actually gives independent producers an incentive to boost production.
However, there is considerable evidence that strongly indicates rampant speculation in today’s oil markets.
As a result, speculatively driven high prices can persist for a considerable time before economic fundamentals bring them down, as finally seems to be happening.
Until Byrnes’ “Speech of Hope,” the Allies were committed to converting “…Germany into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in character.”
But once President Harry Truman’s administration decided to rehabilitate Germany, there was no turning back.
It is the mark of ancient societies, like those of Germany and of Greece, that contemporary tribulations revive old fears and foment new discord.
She could use the opportunity to hint at a new approach to European integration, one that starts in the country that has suffered the most, a victim both of the eurozone’s faulty monetary design and of its society’s own failings.
Just a year ago, the United States had five major freestanding investment banks that stood atop its mighty financial sector.
Let’s ponder this.
Thus, unlike in the 1930’s, the US faces a hypertrophied financial system.
Europe’s Procrustean Nightmare
German-French relations, once the cornerstone of European integration, are at their lowest point in decades.
While Greece’s eurozone partners may be able to carry it for decades this way, and even to bail out Spain, the system would surely collapse under the weight of a larger economy.
But, like the struggling countries of southern Europe, France has few options.
Europe’s leaders must stop treating the eurozone as a homogeneous entity, imposing one-size-fits-all policies on vastly different countries.
In fact, he engineered an agreement to merge Citi with a large insurer – illegal at the time under Glass-Steagall – and then pushed for the law’s repeal, so that the merger could proceed.
Those who say that the financial recent crisis tells us to re-enact Glass-Steagall overlook what failed and what did not: the largest failures in the 2008 crisis – Lehman Brothers, AIG, and the Reserve Primary Fund – were not deposit-taking commercial banks on which Glass-Steagall’s repeal had a major impact.
Rather, the best case arises from a general sense that financial institutions have become too complicated to regulate and too big to fail even when staying within their traditional businesses.
Small-town bankers throughout the country wanted government-guaranteed deposit insurance, while stronger big-city banks feared that government deposit insurance would put them at a competitive disadvantage.
Satu hal yang jarang dibicarakan adalah dampak lingkungan hidup dari proyek ini yang bisa mengakibatkan bencana besar.
Lebih luasnya, semua negara yang bertanggung jawab atas degradasi dan kerusakan di ekosistem perairan dangkal di Laut Cina Selatan harus menghentikan segala tindakan yang mengancam keanekaragaman hayati dan produktivitas ekonomi di wilayah tersebut.
Dalam kondisi yang mengharuskan penerapan hukum internasional, negara-negara yang paling berkuasa yang selayaknya menjadi teladan.
However, this Sputnik moment – actually a “Dragon moment” – delivers a somewhat different message.
Of course, I must confess a personal interest in this question.
Its founder, Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa (who in his spare time also runs Tesla, the electric-car company), funded it with his own money (which he earned at PayPal, another start-up) and that of other private investors.
The US government (or European governments, for that matter) can’t get us out of our current economic mess any better than they can get us to the moon at this point.
Meanwhile, in the United States, the controversy over government spying on its citizens seems to have died down, mostly because people are now convinced that their government will only look at the really bad guys.
Causes are the hardest to understand.
Yes, it is true.
So a “casual” production style was adopted, similar to the design of worn and ripped jeans.
Squaring Asia’s Nuclear Triangle
It emphasized the importance of sharing information about nuclear safety, and incorporated specific measures, including the creation of a framework for rapid notification in the event of an emergency and exchanges of experts to assist in managing future nuclear crises and ensuring that regional concerns are taken into account.
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou was as surprised as the Japanese by the size of the contributions made by his people.
And, while they did bring nuclear safety to the fore and agreed to cooperate and share information with each other, efforts to meet this region-wide challenge cannot succeed without bringing Taiwan into the discussions.

परंतु पिछले महीने श्रीसेना ने अचानक राजपक्षे को उस श्रीलंका फ्रीडम पार्टी के टिकट पर संसदीय चुनाव लड़ने की अनुमति देने का निर्णय लिया जिसका नियंत्रण श्रीसेना ने राष्ट्रपति पद पर विजय प्राप्त कर लेने के बाद राजपक्षे से हासिल कर लिया था। लगता है कि श्रीसेना के विक्रमसिंघे के साथ संबंध बहुत अधिक बिगड़ जाने के कारण, जिनकी लोकतंत्र समर्थक यूनाइटेड नेशनल पार्टी आगामी चुनाव में SLFP की मुख्य प्रतिद्वंद्वी है और SLFP के भीतर गुटबाजी बढ़ जाने के कारण राष्ट्रपति के पास इसके सिवाय कोई विकल्प नहीं बचा है कि वे राजपक्षे को शामिल करें।


But it is not too late for President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government to change course and begin to build a truly multi-ethnic society.
These victories create an opportunity for the government to reach out to the opposition and to minority groups to build a truly inclusive and democratic Sri Lanka, but this has not yet happened.
The government must open itself far more to hearing and responding to the legitimate voices of the Sri Lankan people across the country’s political spectrum and ethnic divides.
But this stability fuels fears that Somaliland’s people will activate the declaration of independence they adopted in 1991.
Saudi Arabia supports the TFG financially and politically.
Secession is in itself neither good nor bad: like divorce, it may make people more or less content.
So there is no question of one clan or faction imposing independence on the others.
Moreover, Central Asian leaders are eager to maintain NATO’s presence in Eurasia as a way to balance China and Russia.
Elsewhere, political parties are weak or are tools of the regime.
Elsewhere in the post-Soviet world, Georgia’s success shows that determined governments can reduce even entrenched venality.
Stagflation Cometh
Now the day of reckoning looms.
What’s more, if the US convinces China to let its currency appreciate, the cost of living in the US and elsewhere will rise.
Europe, for instance, will find it increasingly difficult to export.
After seven years in which America has seen its national debt rise from $5.6 trillion to $9 trillion, this should be welcome news – but the timing couldn’t be worse.
Economic growth rates in the United States and Europe are low – and well below even recent expectations.
Hence the rising risk of a major downturn – and additional fiscal distress.
But the declining value of their sovereign debt – and the size of that debt relative to that of Europe’s smaller distressed countries – implies much greater erosion of banks’ capital base, raising the additional risk of liquidity problems and further economic damage.
But that is neither the majority view, nor the view reflected by the markets.
This somewhat bleak picture could change, though probably not in the short run.
In the autumn, the shootings and deportations resumed, complemented by economic coercion.
We now know, after 20 years of discussion of Soviet documents, that in 1932 Stalin knowingly transformed the collectivization famine in Ukraine into a deliberate campaign of politically motivated starvation.
But Viktor Yanukovych, the current Ukrainian president, denies the special suffering of the Ukrainian people – a nod to Russia’s official historical narrative, which seeks to blur the particular evils of collectivization into a tragedy so vague that it has no clear perpetrators or victims.
And in Belarus, Europe’s last dictatorship, collective farming was never undone, and a former collective farm director, Aleksandr Lukashenko, runs the country.
In large bookstores across Russia, a huge number of political biographies and histories portray Stalin and his era.
Next to Lenin’s tomb is Stalin’s grave and monument, where heaps of fresh flowers are always to be seen on the anniversaries of his birth, his death, and the victory over Hitler.
The reburial of the Romanovs, however, didn’t touch the public’s emotions for long.
Shock therapy that ruined the economy and gave away the country’s wealth to private but rarely clean hands? Neither democracy nor markets are seen by most Russians as absolute values, because they have failed to deliver either prosperity or security.
Instead, acknowledging Stalin is a way for Russians to recall a time of great deeds and perhaps even greater sacrifices.
One of the greatest challenges I faced as the ICTY prosecutor was convincing the Serbian public that the court was not a politically motivated conspiracy against Serbia.
Despite years of complex negotiations, deep disagreements persist over key issues related to amending the statute on aggression, such as state consent and how cases would be initiated.
Whereas Americans depend upon tax-deductible private donations and box office receipts to finance live classical music, Europeans prefer direct government support for the arts.
Daniel Barenboim is rumored to have left the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in part because he objected to the fundraising demands that were being made of him.
But cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth.
If orchestras don’t look after their own futures, they may well not have one to look after.
And inflation is – like default – a capital levy on holders of public debt, as it reduces the real value of nominal liabilities at fixed interest rates.
If growth does not recover, the fiscal problems will worsen while making it more politically difficult to enact the painful reforms needed to restore competitiveness.
If, instead, private debts are excessively socialized, the advanced economies will face a grim future: serious sustainability problems with their public, private, and foreign debt, together with crippled prospects for economic growth.
While North Korea had done much over the preceding years to warrant a more critical eye, in retrospect these policies set back prospects for peace and stability in the region.
At the same time, Obama’s advocacy of direct diplomacy caused concern during the campaign, with some questioning whether this meant that he would meet a leader such as Kim Jong-il without preconditions.
But America must stay the course.
As a result, even the most successful managers lack the skills to cope with today’s resource-constrained markets.
Today, drilling is not only a dirty process characterized by heavy equipment, toxic mud, and sulfurous fumes. With the integration of information technology and hydraulic-fracturing (“fracking”), the central players are experts using joysticks and high-resolution screens to maneuver drill bits through geological formations.
Forward-thinking entrepreneurs are already reaping the benefits of this fast-moving revolution. Those who fail to adapt will fail to survive – and soon.
The debate over therapeutic cloning is, of course, hardly limited to the US and Italy.
Some Christian theologians, for example, believe that life begins at conception, while scientists maintain that nerve and brain cells emerge around 14 days after conception.
And, in order to enable the full enjoyment of our freedoms – be they of worship or scientific research – the state must reassert its secular nature.
Over the same period, there has been a dramatic adjustment of China’s international balance-of-payments position.
This argument is politically expedient – but wrong.
As China rebalances toward a growth model that draws greater support from domestic demand, Washington should stop ranting about the renminbi and start focusing on the opportunities that this bonanza will create.
The Fed Trap
(Not coincidentally, this view coincided with a similar conclusion professed by Bernanke in a scathing attack on the BOJ in the late 1990s.)
In fact, since early 2008, annualized growth in real consumer expenditure has averaged a mere 1.3% – the most anemic period of consumption growth on record.
Fearful of market disruptions, the Fed has embraced a slow-motion exit from QE.
The US Treasury was complaining yet again about the Chinese currency, which had depreciated by 2.4% against the dollar in the first half of 2014, after having appreciated by 37% over the previous eight and a half years.
In the end, moral hair-splitting is less important than the blame game itself – a visible manifestation of the deepening bilateral distrust wrought by a destructive phase of Sino-American codependency.
At around 47% of GDP, China’s embryonic services sector remains well short of the 60-65% share that a middle-income economy typically possesses.
In other words, the cyber blame game is pointless.
On the contrary, financial and economic insecurity has gripped Chinese households since the “iron rice bowl” – the cradle-to-grave support that the socialist state offered workers and their families – was discarded in the late 1990’s.
Several other measures proposed at the Third Plenum seek to shift Chinese families’ behavioral norms.
Today, the task at hand is very different: to transform the technocratic framework of the producer model into the aspirational vision of a flourishing consumer society.
But with China’s leaders now focusing squarely on aligning the vast population’s behavioral norms with the next phase of transformation, the case for a consumer-led China has become more compelling than ever.
I prefaced my question by underscoring the inherent contradiction between a target and a forecast in framing China’s major economic objectives.
Unlike most Western observers, who are fixated on the slightest deviation from the official growth target, Chinese officials are actually far more open-minded.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of the People’s Bank of China, was just as emphatic on this point.
Their shared interpretation of flexible growth targeting puts them basically in the same camp as policymakers in most of the developed world.
But my advice is to keep the champagne on ice.
Accounting for 69% of the economy, consumer demand holds the key to America’s post-crisis malaise.
This should not be surprising.
Until balance sheets are repaired, such “zombie congestion” restrains aggregate demand.
Plunging debt service is largely an outgrowth of the Fed’s unprecedented zero-interest-rate policy.
With bilateral frictions mounting on a number of fronts – including cyber security, territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas, and currency policy – the summit offers an opportunity for a serious reconsideration of the relationship between the world’s two most powerful countries.
Huge Chinese current-account surpluses resulted from too much saving and too little consumption.
China counters by underscoring America’s saving shortfall – a gap that must be plugged by surplus saving from abroad, a current-account deficit, and a multilateral trade imbalance with more than 100 countries.
The upcoming Strategic and Economic Dialogue provides the US and China a platform of engagement to seize their collective opportunities.
NEW HAVEN – Relapse is the rule in the post-crisis global economy.
Consider the US.
This poor performance can only exacerbate the European Central Bank’s deflationary concerns.
When hit by them, vigorously growing economies have cushions to withstand the blows and the resilience to shrug them off.
In Japan, long-standing structural problems, such as aging, labor-market rigidities, and a generalized productivity malaise, can be addressed only through the so-called “third arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s reform agenda, which remains woefully incomplete.
It began so innocently.
China buys Treasuries because they suit its currency policy and the export-led growth that it has relied on over the past 33 years.
China’s purchases of Treasuries help hold down US interest rates – possibly by as much as one percentage point – which provides broad support to other asset markets, such as equities and real estate, whose valuation depends to some extent on Chinese-subsidized US interest rates.
US-led China bashing – a bipartisan blame game that reached new heights in the 2012 political cycle – remains a real threat.
For China, this is not a power race.
This takes an enormous toll.
While my country, Rwanda, has reduced child mortality by 70% over the past decade, the rate of stunting remains high, with 44% of children under the age of five chronically malnourished.
The British medical journal The Lancet has described a package of effective interventions to accomplish this.
Simply flooding markets with cheap high-calorie, low-nutrient grains will never solve chronic malnutrition.


शांति में निवेश के लिए स्पष्ट मानवीय कारणों के अलावा, ख़ास तौर से जब इसे अंतर्राष्ट्रीय विकास के स्थापित ढाँचे के भीतर किया जाता है, ऐसा निवेश अर्थव्यवस्था के विकास और बजट संतुलन के लिए भी सबसे किफ़ायती तरीकों में से एक होता है। यह सचमुच एक चर्चा योग्य विषय है।
Pain can be classified according to a variety of factors, such as duration or location.
The problem is that subjective measures are much more difficult to study – not least because they are associated with high placebo response rates.
Financial incentives have compounded the problem, leading to some alarming trends.
The long-term pain treatment with the strongest empirical support involves lifestyle modifications such as exercise, stress reduction, and weight loss – all of which require significant time and effort.
Synthetic biology is high-tech, and it is also potentially high-risk. Even as it attracts billions of dollars in investment, it is the subject of growing international concern.
Moreover, poor farmers have been actively encouraged to invest in stevia, because its cultivation can help preserve fragile and unique ecosystems. In its annual survey of leading global risks, the World Economic Forum noted that, “the invention of cheap, synthetic alternatives to high-value agricultural exports … could suddenly destabilize vulnerable economies by removing a source of income on which farmers rely.”
Stick to the Resolution
And from the other side, many commentators – anxiously or cynically, according to taste – have drawn parallels with Iraq and other past misuses of Western military power.
And, as for the wider mandate to protect civilians, the resolution allows airborne attacks to knock out tanks or troop columns advancing on Benghazi or other rebel-held towns, and – should they exist – concentrations of forces within those areas that pose a direct and immediate threat to Qaddafi’s opponents.
As the situation in Libya and the wider Middle East unfolds, policymakers are bound to face further acute dilemmas, not least in responding to continuing repression in Tripoli, or the similarly ugly and fragile situations in Bahrain and Yemen.
It should not be. All of this was predictable.
Banks will not lend if the economy is in the doldrums, and American households will be particularly reluctant to borrow – at least in the profligate ways they borrowed prior to the crisis.
But the more immediate problem remains deflation, given high unemployment and excess capacity.
Even putting aside the human suffering, this means, in turn, more problems for the financial system.
But Obama is also concerned with reversing a sharp rise in income inequality (which is now at an 80-year high).
The total tax burden on families also includes sales taxes, which are steeply regressive, and property taxes, which are progressive.
Public consumption is just as progressive as transfer payments.
Indeed, from 2000 to 2004, the increase in net government expenditures accounted for 150% of income growth, as other sources of income shriveled up.
The S&amp;P’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the trailing 12 months is close to 20, compared to a long-run mean of 15.53 and a median of 14.57.
(Of course, markets take detours along the way, driven by, say, irrational exuberance, temporary declines in the impact of value investors, or mistimed contrarian trades.)
There is some evidence that this is now occurring in advanced economies, with the proliferation of labor-saving digital technologies and the globalization of supply chains suppressing income growth.
Nonetheless, several features of current growth patterns stand out: excess productive capacity, persistent high leverage, declining labor content in goods-and-services production, and an increasingly unequal distribution of income both between labor and capital, and across labor-income segments, with their differential savings rates.
This 6.9% annual average return has since been referred to as “Siegel’s constant,” as if Siegel had discovered a new law of nature.
On closer inspection, the idea that the market will yield a real 6.9% a year in the future appears suspect.
Of course, if one looks at many different investment strategies and many different countries, one can find something that performed spectacularly in the past, even if there is no strategy that can be expected to do so well in the future.
The US was actually ranked first among the 39 countries.
That is, the markets have been more vulnerable to sudden large drops than they have been to sudden large increases.

Before that, between the third quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2002, real S&amp;P 500 earnings fell 55% – the biggest-ever decline since the index was created in 1957.
Big drops get their attention, and this primes some people to be attentive for them in the future, and to be ready to sell if another one comes.
BERKELEY – After the second 40% decline in America’s Standard &amp; Poor’s composite index of common stocks in a decade, global investors are shell-shocked.

But aren’t stocks risky?
True, a steep and persistent collapse in earnings will erode wealth invested in stocks.
Stop Coddling Belarus
So it is now more important than ever that European parliamentarians unite and make their position clear.
But at the same time the OSCE is condemning these anti-democratic practices, its own Parliamentary Assembly maintains full-fledged cooperation with the Belarusian parliament.
Even that small number is likely to diminish, as Lukashenka keeps up political, financial, and legal pressure on them.
Stop Digging And Start Thinking
This fact will be noted everywhere, particularly in Teheran.
The US will have to enter talks – direct and bilateral if necessary.
Iraq is a disaster, and nothing indicates that the situation can be turned around.
Militant Palestinians and Lebanese know that a captured Israeli soldier or civilian is either a cause of conflict or a valuable bargaining chip for prisoner exchange.
As before there were expressions of “deep regret,” a promise of “immediate investigation” and the explanation that dropped leaflets had warned families in the region to leave their homes.
Except for mutually agreeable negotiated modifications, Israel’s official pre-1967 borders must be honored.
Similarly, Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez has broadcast his intention to purchase Russian Mig fighter jets and Brazilian low-flying surveillance aircraft, and to expand military expenditures.
In Venezuela, keeping his former comrades in arms happy is obviously a concern for Chávez. But festering conflicts with his Colombian neighbors are also a factor, particularly in view of the constant accusations and suspicions that Chávez comforts and supports the FARC guerrillas in Colombia.
Obviously, I am rooting for the Mexican candidate, Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez.
So rising prices feed back into more rising prices, and the cycle repeats again and again – for a while.
The whole world can’t recover all of the enthusiasm of a few years ago from feedback alone, for there is a giant coordination problem: we are not all attentive to price increases at the same time, so we make decisions to buy at very different times.
But it is hard today to re-create such a narrative, given so many stories of trouble.
This means making capitalism work better, and making it clear that there is no threat of protectionism.
For example, the Philippines is revamping its security strategy by enhancing cooperation with the United States – China’s counterweight in the region – only two decades after it closed two major American military installations, the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base.
Some claim that the local PLA commander initiated the “stand-off,” while others contend that China’s new president, Xi Jinping, was using the transgression to assert his authority over the PLA.
Moreover, India is working to safeguard its naval superiority over China.
This antiquated international spoils system is a leftover of the post-World War II order, in which the victorious powers divided the leading positions in the world economic institutions among themselves.
What should the IMF do if a country wants to leave the eurozone, or if a European country defaults on its debts, as Argentina did?
In the interest of the IMF’s credibility – and of the stability of the world economy – Strauss-Kahn should put the matter to rest once and for all, by declaring unequivocally his intentions regarding the French presidency.
The ASEAN+3 is now strengthening the CMIM by doubling the total fund size to $240 billion.
Last year, ASEAN+3 established a regional surveillance unit, the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO), to monitor regional economies, detect emerging vulnerabilities, and support effective decision-making by the CMIM. But it is unclear whether AMRO has sufficient capacity and expertise to monitor 13 countries effectively.
In particular, the IMF and ASEAN+3 financing arrangement should establish a regular channel of dialogue to facilitate information exchange and prepare concrete guidelines for cooperation and an appropriate division of tasks.
The International Monetary Fund provides one of the most important tools.
Second, there is now clear advice to the Fund’s member countries on how they should run their exchange rate policies, and on what is acceptable to the international community.
Few countries need to borrow from the IMF – a highly positive trend.
How to Boost Foreign Investment
This began to change with the rapid proliferation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs), which typically granted private investors standing before the ICSID.
Moreover, the devaluation of the reputational benefit of being a party to the ICSID encourages countries to leave the system, as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela have recently done.
Beyond the obvious availability of countervailing duties as an enforcement tool, several of the DSM’s institutional characteristics, which are absent in the ICSID, help to create and sustain legitimacy.
The risk of nuclear or other radioactive material falling into the wrong hands is all too real.
The uranium was seized in a sting operation.
The proposed amendment was agreed in 2005, but it still has not entered into force, because not enough countries have ratified it.
Peer reviews have been shown to work – for example, in improving safety at nuclear power plants.
हरारे - व्यवसाय शुरू करना मुश्किल काम हो सकता है, ख़ास तौर से अफ़्रीका में, जहाँ कमज़ोर शासन प्रणालियाँ और महत्वपूर्ण संसाधनों तक अपर्याप्त पहुँच सफलता में बाधा बन सकती है। अफ़्रीका के किसानों के लिए, चुनौतियाँ विशेष रूप से स्पष्ट हैं। गतिशील और आधुनिक कृषि क्षेत्र के व्यापक आर्थिक और सामाजिक लाभों को देखते हुए, किसानों को ऐसे प्रोत्साहन, निवेश, और विनियम उपलब्ध करना सर्वोच्च प्राथमिकता होनी चाहिए जिनकी उन्हें सफल होने के लिए ज़रूरत है।


The unemployment rate is 5.6% and falling.
As a result, these countries can expect lower capital inflows, again making for weak local currencies.
As it stands, the low official unemployment rate can be explained partly by declining participation rates, especially among workers aged 25-54.
Currency forecasting is a mug’s game.
The question now is how quickly are species being destroyed – and what can be done to stop it.
· Most species have very small geographical ranges and are uncommon locally.
The CBD’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity calls for the formal protection of at least 17% of the most ecologically important terrestrial areas, while the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation seeks to protect 60% of plant species.
LONDON – The G-8 recently asked the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was created to support the post-communist transitions to democracy and market economies in Central and Eastern Europe, to put its experience to use in Egypt.
The richness of Eastern European transition experience offers valuable clues about how to break out of being “stuck in transit.”
In fact, the ability of voters to remove incumbent governments has proven to be a strength, not a weakness.
As for most of the countries of the former Soviet Union, which remain stuck in transit, EU membership is not in the cards for North Africa and the Middle East.
General Electric and IBM have both opened schools where students can benefit from a focus on math, engineering, and science.
Externships offer students a better way to acquire skills, because students are given an opportunity to help a company solve a real-world problem from the classroom.
Finally, they work on identifying problems themselves, forming teams, and competing in international venues.
By helping companies solve their real-world problems, students can prepare themselves to meet the challenges of the future.
Who but the most die-hard global-warming denier could resist the notion, as Earth Hour’s American website phrased it this year, that merely “by flipping off your lights on March 27 at 8:30 p.m. local time you will be making the switch to a cleaner, more secure nation”?
As WWF Director-General James Leape explained, it provides “a global platform for millions of people to voice their concern about the devastating effects of climate change.”
Surely, there is a lesson here.
But the centuries-old culture of leadership that is ingrained in many African societies has played an equally disastrous role.
When sub-Saharan African countries gained independence in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s, their leaders inherited bankrupt states with no access to international capital markets. As a result, newly established African leaders had no alternative but to sub-contract economic development to the IMF and World Bank and the Western countries that control them.
According to the US Energy Department, America’s annual oil imports from Africa will soon reach 770 millions barrels, bringing an estimated $200 billion to the continent over the next decade.
Europe, Asia, and, increasingly, Latin America, are showing that regional integration provides the healthiest path to development.

Adanya pasar karbon yang meliputi 85% emisi gas rumah kaca menjadi inti strategi pemerintah Québec untuk melawan perubahan iklim.
Negara bagian ini berkontribusi pada lebih dari 40% kapasitas operasional listrik yang bersumber pada tenaga angin di Australia dan menjadi salah satu negara dengan tingkat penetrasi tenaga surya yang tertinggi di dunia (satu dari empat rumah tangga memiliki sistem fotovoltaik).
Advocates of greater labor-market flexibility insist that paying employers to hire young people is the wrong approach.
So those who are included and benefit by free enterprise, yet are burdened by the social costs of exclusion, should all be willing to pay something to remedy these conditions.
What is needed is higher employment and pay through higher demand for the least productive workers.
Since the least skilled workers face morale problems that lower their wages and erode their employability, it makes sense to deliver the mutual gain that is redistributed to them through subsidies that encourage greater self-support and employment.
But the past few years have underscored NATO’s inability to achieve sustained political, economic, and security improvements in Afghanistan without more effective international collaboration, particularly with China and Russia.

In May 2008, China obtained a major economic stake in Afghanistan when Chinese firms won a $3.5 billion contract to develop Afghanistan’s huge Aynak copper field.
In turn, NATO and Afghan forces could assign troops to protect these projects from further attacks, ideally with some kind of Chinese and Russian financial assistance to blunt objections that Western soldiers are dying to enrich foreign companies. China’s close ties to Pakistan could also prove useful in assisting European and American efforts to keep the Pakistani military and intelligence services allied against the Taliban.
It wants more local control.
For starters, the central or federal government should retain significant fiscal powers.
And that, revealingly, is precisely what the eurozone has.
These issues are now likely to be reopened with further devolution.
JOHANNESBURG – It has been said, correctly, that Sudan is a microcosm of Africa.
Conflict has also communicated the unequivocal message that unity cannot be secured and maintained by force alone.
A turbulent and unstable Sudan would not therefore be a catalyst of peace and stability in Africa, and vice versa.”
It is in Africa’s interest to see Sudan’s people living together in peace and cooperating with one another for their mutual benefit – fully respecting one another’s diverse but not mutually exclusive interests, whether they live in one country or two.
The terrible tragedy of the country’s western Darfur region continues unabated.
But it was our meetings with the ordinary people of Sudan that left the deepest impression.
After all, Sudan is not a small, insignificant country; it is the tenth largest – the biggest in Africa and in the Arab world.
Moreover, full and unfettered access by international election observers to monitor next year’s elections and the referendum in 2011 is essential.
The door to a better future for Sudan remains open.
From a truly secular and global perspective, the difficulty lies in explaining the pre-crisis boom.
Central to understanding this puzzle are two distinctive features of the emerging-market productivity shock: it was resource-intensive and mercantilist in origin and consequence.
That may have been true in the immediate aftermath of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but it was quickly overtaken by the growth imperative.
Today, as world growth decelerates, secular stagnation seems plausible once again.
The Sunni militant group Boko Haram, known internationally for abducting 276 schoolgirls in April and forcing them to marry its members, has been wreaking havoc in Nigeria for years.
The sectarianism plaguing the Sunni belt is affecting even the relatively stable oil sheikdoms of the Gulf, where a schism within the Gulf Cooperation Council is spurring new tensions and proxy competition among its members.
The UAE and Qatar have already instituted compulsory military service for adult males.
On the contrary, in the Sunni arc today, it means a vicious cycle of expanding extremism, rapid population growth, rising unemployment, worsening water shortages, and popular discontent.
World leaders should be happy that the IMF stands ready to take the lead in the next phase of the global financial crisis, even if its lending resources of approximately $250 billion are inadequate to stem the current run on emerging markets.
In principle, the IMF could be allowed to print money (it already has its own accounting unit, the so-called Special Drawing Rights).
As tempting as it may be to ramp up IMF lending on a long-term basis, this would be a strategic mistake for both the world and the Fund.
Meanwhile, Germany’s insistence on imposing losses on bank creditors in Cyprus is the latest symptom of bailout fatigue in the core.
Overall, these four countries (the BRICs) have been over-hyped, and other emerging economies may do better in the next decade: Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia in Asia; Chile, Colombia, and Peru in Latin America; and Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Poland in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
Its current-account deficit remains large, and monetary policy has been confusing, as the objective of boosting competitiveness and growth clashes with the need to control inflation and avoid excessive credit expansion.
Mothers’ Day is upon us in many countries around the world.
“Life lost its meaning,” she told American lawmakers in 2008.
They may struggle to find proper nutrition and work long hours in factories and fields until the day they go into labor.
Add some basic antibiotics, blood transfusions, and a safe operating room, and the risk of death can almost be eliminated.
Despite recent financial market turbulence, the underlying dynamic of the world economy remains essentially unchanged.
The evidence suggests that other factors such as the quality of economic and political institutions are at least as important in determining how much capital a country will attract.
But even if capital controls could still fully insulate a country from the forces of financial globalization, such a goal would not be desirable.
But is everyone really ready to receive such large amounts of capital and to carefully manage its macroeconomic impact?
Yet the global economy is not delivering sustainable growth in two basic senses.
To seize the benefits of these new technologies at scale, and to avoid investments that aggravate cascading environmental crises, the finance industry will need to understand how the SDGs will reshape the investment landscape.
This implies the continued globalization of finance, which will be essential to allocate money from capital-rich regions to their poor, capital-scarce counterparts, as well as to develop local capital markets that can facilitate capital formation and protect countries from the vagaries of global sentiment.
With United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s call to action in his report “The Road to Dignity,” the Year of Sustainable Development has begun.
The SDGs are premised on the need for rapid far-reaching change.
The July summit will seek to elicit from the world’s governments a commitment to allocate more funds to social needs.
Back in 2009 and 2010, the world’s governments agreed to keep the rise in global temperature to below 2° Celsius relative to the pre-industrial era.
PRAGUE – Over the next 15 years, some two billion children will be born, 90% in the poorest parts of the world.
Although the child mortality rate has been reduced by two-thirds since 1970, a horrifying number of children still die in their first years of life. In 2013, 6.3 million children died before their fifth birthday.
Kids who do not get enough to eat during their vital early years do not develop properly and remain disadvantaged throughout their lives. Even those who get enough overall calories can suffer ill effects, if they are deprived of essential vitamins, minerals, and protein.

दूसरा उद्देश्य है सार्वजनिक प्रबंधन के लिए डेटा। अधिकारी अब सरकारी सुविधाओं, परिवहन नेटवर्कों, आपात राहत कार्यों, सार्वजनिक स्वास्थ्य निगरानी, हिंसक अपराधों, और अन्य कई चीज़ों के बारे में उन्हें वर्तमान स्थिति के बारे में सूचित किए जाने के लिए रीयल-टाइम डैशबोर्ड रख सकते हैं। नागरिक प्रतिक्रिया से भी कामकाज में सुधार किए जा सकते हैं, जैसे चालकों से यातायात की जानकारी को क्राउडसोर्स करके। भौगोलिक सूचना प्रणालियों (जीआईएस) से स्थानीय सरकारों और दूर-दराज के क्षेत्रों में स्थित जिलों में रीयल-टाइम निगरानी की जा सकती है।

GENEVA – After decades of reluctance on the part of world leaders, a rapid, smooth, and purposeful transition toward sustainable development seems unlikely.
Indeed, agreements like last year’s deal between China and the United States to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions – not to mention initiatives to mobilize business, such as We Mean Business – are unlikely to happen without them.
As the UN Environment Programme emphasized in a briefing at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saving the financial sector from itself can accelerate the transition to sustainable development.
What the world needs now are leaders who are willing to bridge the gap between daunting short-term demands and desirable long-term outcomes.
Trend ini dipicu oleh lonjakan tenaga surya di Tiongkok dan Jepang dan peningkatan investasi negara-negara Eropa untuk pembangkit tenaga angin di laut.
Rancangan sistem keuangan kita yang sekarang tidak menjamin kondisi yang disebut Gubernur Bank of England, Mark Carney, sebagai “tragedy of horizons” – kegagalan pada pasar yang diakibatkan oleh ketidakmampuan investor, perusahaan, dan pemerintah dalam menyelesaikan permasalahan seperti perubahan iklim, sehingga menciptakan konsekuensi yang baru akan dirasakan jauh di masa depan – tidak akan terjadi.
Pemberlakuan tujuan baru ini menunjukkan penerimaan secara luas atas fakta bahwa semua negara berbagi tanggung jawab yang sama untuk menjaga stabilitas jangka panjang siklus alami bumi, dimana kemampuan planet untuk mendukung kehidupan kita bergantung padanya.
Populasi global akan distabilkan.
Pada tahun 2030 nanti, besar kemungkinan beberapa negara dapat melepaskan diri dari bahan bakar fosil, dimana negara seperti Swedia, Prancis, dan Jerman akan memimpin.
MADRID – Next month, the world will achieve a milestone for global development efforts.
Likewise, primary-school enrollment rates have risen from 83% to 91% since 2000.
In this sense, the SDGs more clearly reflect the conviction, upheld by the UN, that all of us are global citizens.
But it is up to the international community to ensure that all governments establish specific goals and deadlines for meeting them.
Information technology – this century’s defining social and economic development – receives only a brief mention (in one of the sub-targets).
As smartphone subscriptions increase from 2.9 billion to 7.7 billion worldwide in the next five years, 80% of the new accounts are expected to be opened by users on these two continents.
If the SDGs are any indication, it is likely that they are not.
MDGs akan meneruskan upaya pengentasan kemiskinan, serta menambahkan tantangan guna memastikan pemerataan pembangunan dan keberlanjutan lingkungan hidup, khususnya sasaran utama untuk meminimalisasi bahaya perubahan iklim yang disebabkan manusia.
Dalam salah satu pidato terbaik di sejarah kepresidenan modern Amerika Serikat, disampaikan pada bulan Juni 1963, Kennedy berkata: “Saat kita bisa mendefinisikan tujuan dengan lebih jelas, menjadikannya lebih mudah diatur dan diterapkan, kita akan membuatnya terlihat nyata bagi semua orang sehingga mereka mampu merajut harapan dan melangkah menuju pencapaian tanpa halangan apapun.”
Proses multi-stakeholder ini sangat penting untuk mengatasi tantanga-tantangan kompleks dalam pembangunan berkelanjutan dan upaya melawan kemiskinan, kelaparan, dan penyakit.
Meskipun terdapat sinisme, kebingungan, dan politik menghalangi-halangi yang muncul di tengah upaya memberantas kemiskinan, ketidaksetaraan, dan degradasi lingkungan hidup, masih dimungkinkan timbulnya terobosan baru, Negara-negara berkekuatan besar di dunia mungkin terlihat tidak responsif, namun mereka dapat berubah.
The MDGs were remarkably successful in several of these areas.
Forty years after rich countries promised to dedicate 0.7% of GDP to aid, their commitments remain at less than half that level.
While levels of private finance dwarf international public finance, directing these private funds to programs that reach the poorest and protect the environment requires the right policy incentives, such as a price on carbon, regulatory certainty, and the wise use of public money.
We must improve and expand these types of partnerships to other challenges, such as infrastructure, agriculture, and energy.
Subsidi ini melemahkan anggaran pemerintah, menganjurkan penggunaan energi yang berlebihan, dan meningkatkan polusi dan emisi karbon dioksida.
Melalui kebijakan yang tepat dan dukungan internasional, negara-negara ini dapat berinvestasi pada infrastruktur yang dibutuhkan untuk mewujudkan pilihan energi yang lebih beragam.
Investasi ini meliputi penyimpanan energi, perbaikan sistem perkiraan dan smart grids – yang seluruhnya memperoleh manfaat dari terobosan-terobosan teknologi dan penurunan harga.
Berkat penurunan harga minyak, inovasi dan skala ekonomis dalam sektor energi terbarukan, kini visi tersebut dapat menjadi kenyataan.
Leaders must confront outmoded ways of working; endless hours of protocol (the sign of a poor government is a happy protocol office); and a dearth of sound advice on problems that developing countries frequently face, from financing infrastructure to attracting global investment.
Clearly, we need a wider concept of the finance and policies required to support development.
This should encourage us to find the right way for governments and philanthropists to cooperate in bringing about transformative, not merely palliative, change.
These changes are shaping our future in a positive way.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle will be the huge legacy of public debt, which now averages about 110% of GDP in the advanced economies – the highest level since World War&#160;II.
As a result, the system as a whole is not yet much safer than it was in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed.
While growth is essential for the future global economy, it must be a different kind of growth – inclusive and not simply the fallout of unfettered globalization.
The year 2013 offers the chance to put the economic crisis behind us and to shape the world for the better.
The Secretary-General’s Global Sustainability Panel has issued a new report that outlines a framework for sustainable development.
By 2050, there will most likely be more than nine billion people.
And we do so using an internal combustion engine that utilizes only a small part of the energy released by burning the gasoline. Most of the energy is lost as waste heat.
We must understand our shared fate, and embrace sustainable development as a common commitment to decency for all human beings, today and in the future.
In many places, especially in rural areas, women spend long hours each day finding fuel wherever they can in the absence of sustainable energy sources.
Worldwide, 800 women die each day from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and the vast majority of these deaths could be averted by providing quality health services, for which electricity is usually required.
Evidence from India and Nepal suggests that women’s involvement in decision-making is associated with better local environmental management.
If I were raped in Uppsala, where Assange is alleged to have committed his crime, I could not expect top prosecutors to lobby governments to arrest my assailant.
She is right: According to a report by Amnesty International, as of 2008, the number of reported rapes in Sweden had quadrupled in 20 years, but only 20% of cases were ever prosecuted.
Likewise, Swedish intake centers for victims of male violence are woefully underfunded – like all support services for rape and abuse victims across Europe and North America – leaving many women who face threats to their safety and that of their children waiting for unavailable places in shelters.
The day before, a bomb threat had been left at the building, warning of what was about to happen.
In January 2009, church officials in the town of Luleå cancelled a planned torch-light procession for Holocaust Memorial Day, with a spokesman saying that they were “preoccupied” and “grief-stricken” by Israel’s Operation Cast Lead in Gaza.
While all manifestations of intolerance against Muslims must be firmly resisted, it is also vital to recognize the danger that some Muslim immigrants have brought with them from their home cultures: extreme forms of bigotry against Jews and Israel.
Sweden in Crisis
In fact, the three leftist parties in Parliament gained a slightly smaller share of the popular vote than they did in the 2010 election.
Until 2010, Sweden seemed immune to the rise of far-right parties like those in Denmark, Norway, and Finland.
During the Bosnian War of the 1990s, Sweden opened its doors to some 100,000 people – a challenge at any time, much less during a period of profound economic crisis.
But other European countries will have to bear more of the burden, and the authorities will have to do more to facilitate integration.
MEXICO CITY – As the saying goes: when the tide goes out, you find out who has been swimming without a bathing suit.
The global financial crisis thus revealed the Mexican economy’s inability to innovate, promote investment, create jobs, or provide conditions for social mobility.
Regrettably, the promotion of economic growth has not been a priority for either the Calderón administration or that of his predecessor, Vicente Fox.
What is certain is that health officials risk mishandling how they explain this new and potentially alarming threat to the public.
But even a mild influenza virus kills a lot of people, especially those with other medical problems.
In the grip of “panic panic,” officials issue over-reassuring statements, suppress or delay alarming news, and speak contemptuously about how the public is “irrational,” “hysterical,” or “panicking.”
Health officials should guide people through their adjustment reactions, not demand that they skip that step.

Let us hope that officials elsewhere will do better. 
Obviously, exiting a real currency union is far more complex and legally fraught than ending a temporary exchange-rate arrangement; the effects of such a move would be greatly magnified.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Swiss move reveals at least some of the uncertainties that a full-fledged exit could create.
In the late 1960s, the Bundesbank had to buy dollar assets in order to stop the Deutsche mark from rising, and to preserve the integrity of its fixed exchange rate.
The Deutsche mark appreciated, and life became very hard for German exporters.
The negative effects for the Swiss economy – through the decreased competiveness of its export industries (including tourism and medicine) – may already be showing that abandoning the euro peg was not a good idea.
There is, however, a lively debate about whether there was a fourth big mistake: Alan Greenspan’s decision in 2001-2004 to push and keep nominal interest rates on US Treasury securities very low in order to try to keep the economy near full employment.
Some days I think that, in the future, central bankers must also recognize that it is imprudent to lower interest rates in pursuit of full employment when doing so risks causing an asset price bubble.
There were plenty of other mistakes that generated the catastrophe that faces us today.
After the government’s military achievements in Quseir and Homs, there has been some tactical regrouping by the opposition.
Those who fear a jihadi takeover cite recent events in Sinai.
But no coherent action or policy followed this powerful statement.
Aleppo is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world – and one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the war.
Falling oil prices and economic sanctions have affected both countries.
If the negotiations so far had recognized this and been conducted with more tenacity, the conflict in Syria could have been resolved long ago, averting much death and destruction.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has asked the new commissioner for regional policy, Johannes Hahn, to make recommendations aimed at redefining the European Neighborhood Policy, the framework through which the EU relates to its immediate geopolitical environment.
Syria, and its largest city, is the perfect place to start seeking a better way.
Assad’s fall would deny the organization its vital logistic hinterland in Syria, making it vulnerable to challenges by insurgent Sunni militias.
As in Libya, the fighting would make the country ungovernable.
Assad’s final days are unlikely to be pretty.
This year will mark the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Accords, which ended the Bosnian War.
The international community has been unable to achieve any unity of action, much less agreement on a way forward.
What made the approach to Milošević possible was not that the 1990s were a gentler era (the Serbs’ campaign of ethnic cleansing, featuring concentration camps and capped by their genocidal attack on the Muslim Bosniaks of Srebrenica in July 1995, refute that notion).
Syria may be heading for eventual Sunni rule, displacing the political dominance of Assad’s Alawite sect.
The roots of US strategy in Syria lie in a strange– and unsuccessful – union of two sources of American foreign policy.
The problem, as human-rights advocates should have learned long ago, is that the US security establishment’s regime-change model does not work.
Saudi Arabia wanted Assad gone to weaken a client state of Iran, the kingdom’s main rival for regional primacy.
While roughly 500 people per month were killed from March to August 2011, some 100,000 civilians – around 3,200 per month – died between September 2011 and April 2015, with the total number of dead, including combatants, reaching perhaps 310,000, or 10,000 per month.
In Syria, only multilateralism can succeed.
That same urgency must be applied to peacemaking in Syria; after all, the refugees are a product of the country’s long, brutal, multi-sided civil war. The seriousness of the situation in Syria cannot be overstated.
Only if external powers think beyond military operations and devise a political solution to the crisis can the fight against the Islamic State succeed.
A good place to start would be by urging the so-called E3/EU+3 group – that is, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the US, and the UK), Germany, and the EU – to convene.
It was in the Balkans that the process of carving out nation-states from the Ottoman mosaic began. And it was a process that kicked off two decades of devastating wars – the first at the beginning of the twentieth century, the second in the 1990s.
Syria’s Christian minority would also be a victim of such an effort.
Indeed, Russia and the United States are circling each other like boxers before the contest actually begins, supporting different factions and trying to ensure that their allies in the multi-sided conflict are advancing, or at least holding ground.
The other countries have yet to take action.
Japan also wants to speed up implementation of the Iran nuclear deal, so that it can take advantage of the business opportunities that will result when economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic are lifted.
Egyptian diplomats are thus excellent candidates to exert pressure for compromise.
So the conflict in Syria is taking place on at least three levels: local, regional, and global.
But, although all players have agreed to fight ISIS first and foremost, the big question remains whether they will in fact do so.
Such a tendency is already visible in Iraq.
In this context, an important factor will be how the West treats its Muslims – as welcome citizens with equal rights and obligations, or as permanent outsiders and fodder for jihadist recruiters.
The new Arab generation’s quest for dignity is rooted in a yearning for decent government and civil rights that was long denied under the pretext of conflict with the “Zionist crusaders.”
Al-Qaeda’s move to the Levant also threatens to spark a momentous confrontation between Sunni radicals – some of whom have recently taken control of part of the Syrian-Lebanese border – and the Shia Hezbollah in Lebanon.
And yet the West is also hesitant to act, owing to fears of a repeat of the Iraq debacle.
The other three are Syria’s behavior in Iraq, its relations with the US, and the need for domestic reform.
Hariri’s assassination makes that far more difficult, and Syria must prepare for a strong backlash from the US and France.
There are signs that the Syrians are unable to gauge American intentions on other issues as well.
The reshuffle last November that brought Kanaan and others into the cabinet was seen to reflect Assad’s preferences.
On one side, the United States, the European Union, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar are backing the opposition – a welter of armed factions with diverse agendas and ideologies that range from Syrian nationalist to global jihadi.
In order to defeat them, the opposition needs more sophisticated weapons – and its backers are ready to oblige.
When the Arab Spring began to unfold, Assad adopted the same approach, hoping that it would rally his Alawite supporters and scare the rest of the public into submission.
BERLIN – Syrian opposition activists regularly express disappointment with the level of international support that they receive.
In fact, the international community is waiting for Syria’s disorganized opposition to transform itself into a coherent, effective force as much as the opposition is waiting for the international community.
These groups already share a common goal – to bring down Assad’s regime – and most of them (with a few ultra-militant exceptions) hope to build a peaceful, inclusive, and democratic state.
Such a transitional authority could call upon the international community for needed support more easily than an exiled rebel group could.
After a decade of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, the West would rather stay at home; neither the US nor the United Kingdom – nor most other NATO members – wants to become entangled in another Middle East conflict that cannot be won.
But all of this has been happening already, and it will continue to happen, especially without American military intervention. The civil war will escalate further, because it is part of a larger contest for supremacy between Iran and its Shia allies and Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the other Sunni countries.
A defeat in Congress – entirely foreseeable – would have been a foreign-policy disaster.
This is the decisive moral and political question for the West.
In the war against the Islamic State, diplomacy will be vital to galvanize an alliance of countries dedicated to the group’s complete eradication – which will, however, have to happen on the battlefield.
It is time for the Sunni Muslim world to act more resolutely toward the brutal movement that it has, intentionally or not, helped to spawn.
The first pillar of democracy may be majority rule, but it is a hollow – and unstable – achievement if the second pillar, minority rights, is not also put in place.
Rather than getting distracted by some sense of wounded pride, those who have engaged in a conflict that has killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of innocent people and displaced millions more should decide to do what it takes to end the mayhem.
The lack of opportunities on offer in Syria’s neighbors is exacerbating the underlying economic problem.
The rest of the region wanted to emulate them.
There is no substitute for lasting peace in Syria. But they would offer a chance to begin addressing a tragic and avoidable consequence of the civil war: the exclusion of millions of people from the opportunity to earn a legal living for themselves and their families.
Instead of forcing a “Grexit,” the EU could trap Greece inside the eurozone and starve it of money, then simply sit back and watch the Tsipras government’s domestic political support collapse.
Given this possibility, Varoufakis may have believed that he was making other EU finance ministers a generous offer by proposing to cut the primary surplus from 4% to 1% of GDP, rather than all the way to zero.
The European treaties state unequivocally that euro membership is irreversible unless a country decides to exit not just from the single currency but from the entire EU.
Some fear a return to the uncertainty of 2012, when many thought that a Greek default and exit from the eurozone were imminent.
For starters, Syriza and others argue that Greece's public debt, at a massive 170% of GDP, is unsustainable and must be cut.
To be sure, one can reasonably argue that austerity in the eurozone has been excessive, and that fiscal deficits should have been much larger to sustain demand.
Last year, the new Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, confirmed the prediction, arguing that a primary surplus would give Greece the upper hand in any negotiations on debt restructuring, because it could just suspend repayments to the troika, without incurring any financing problems.
How wrong we were.
Post-Soviet Russia’s struggle to integrate into the international order, together with its rejection of modernization, has fueled a revisionist nationalism based on spheres of influence.
Recognizing Asia’s profound importance to the new world order, US President Barack Obama announced a strategic “pivot” toward the region in 2012.
Member states’ tactical approach to their particular problems (often defined by their status as creditor or debtor) has left the EU bereft of credible leadership and a unified vision. A more strategic approach would focus on boosting growth throughout the EU, such as by meeting the Europe 2020 targets for research, development, and innovation, and advancing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Since then, China has sought to make good on Mao's pledge.
But, there is another dynamic at work.
For economic convergence, if allowed to ripen, could set Taiwan and the PRC on an evolutionary course toward common sovereignty.
For the first time in fifty years, China and Taiwan share real interests.
A recount was demanded.
But the questions on everyone's lips are whether the loser of the recount will accept the result, and whether Taiwan's young democracy can survive this tumult?
That dominance is now definitively a thing of the past.
For example, the two parties are now engaged in tense negotiations to amend the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law to avert any repeat of the current confused circumstances surrounding the current recount.
Now Taiwan has become something of a diplomatic afterthought because it no longer makes trouble.
He has eased tensions with China by focusing on what both sides can agree upon.
But each side’s interests need not be mutually exclusive.
This may require that the Taiwanese abandon their tendency to hold regular referenda to show that they enjoy this right.
This diplomatic strike occurred at roughly the same time that Taiwan was failing - for the thirteenth time - in its bid to re-enter the United Nations, having been expelled when China was admitted in 1971.
Frustrated by a lack of recognition, popular disgust in Taiwan with terms like "China" and "Chinese" is rising.
Alarmed by a potential conflict between the two archrivals, the Bush administration urged Chen, who won a second term in March, to exercise restraint.
It is imperative for both economies that direct transport links be established immediately.
It is the deepest countryside.
In our village, there used to be two of every shop – butcher’s shop, bakery, hardware store.
Thanks to our television, we have of course been able to witness signs of progress elsewhere.
At home, meanwhile, small, distinctively French businesses – cheese makers, patisseries, or restaurateurs – get hammered by heavy taxes and social-welfare costs while supermarkets flourish selling products from Asia.
True, nobody has been killed by a nuclear weapon since the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 65 years ago this month.
And there is the disconcerting prospect that new civil nuclear-energy players will insist on building uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing plants of their own, rightly described as “bomb starter kits.”
The messages must be stark: nuclear weapons are not only the most indiscriminately inhumane weapons ever invented, but the only ones capable of destroying life on this planet as we know it. Carbon dioxide can also kill us, but not as quickly as bombs.
Indeed, as far as protecting the public is concerned, drug safety is the regulator’s neglected stepchild.
These judgments vary, depending on whether they are made by a drug company, which stands to benefit from sales, or a patient at risk of suffering a serious adverse effect.
It is especially difficult to attribute an adverse reaction to a drug if the medical event is common in the user’s age group or in the condition being treated.
It is unfair to blame clinicians for serious ADR’s, particularly in the absence of complete safety information.
Taking Hope in the Long View
For the first time, more than half of the world will have enough food not to be hungry, enough shelter not to be wet, enough clothing not to be cold, and enough medical care not to be worried that they and most of their children will die prematurely of micro-parasites.
But what was shipped back from America across the Atlantic to Europe – and what was paid for in imports from Asia with American products – was never real wealth.
Third – and in large part a consequence of the other two – the rise of the professional inventor and the industrial research laboratory created a class of people whose business was not to make and apply a single invention, but to invent the process of continuous and constant invention and innovation itself.
An ambitious new plan, called the Integrated Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhea, launched this month by the World Health Organization and UNICEF, aims to step up existing interventions and pool global efforts, with the goal of reducing the number of deaths from pneumonia to less than three children per 1,000, and of diarrhea-related deaths to below one in 1,000.
That is why we now need the Integrated Global Action Plan.
To date, GAVI has helped countries immunize more than 13 million children against pneumococcal disease and five million children against rotavirus, with plans to strengthen its efforts in countries where immunization coverage is below 70%.
Technology, in particular, is changing the nature of work itself, rendering entire sectors and occupations obsolete, while creating completely new industries and job categories.
As technology increasingly takes over knowledge-based work, the cognitive skills that are central to today’s education systems will remain important; but behavioral and non-cognitive skills necessary for collaboration, innovation, and problem solving will become essential as well.
Policymakers must use stronger metrics to assess human capital and reexamine investment in education, curriculum design, hiring and firing practices, women’s integration into the workforce, retirement policies, immigration legislation, and welfare policies.
Pakistani army commandos fought the intruders for several hours before killing the last attacker.
More recently, however, three crucial developments have altered the environment in which Islamic extremists operate in Pakistan.
A former senior World Bank official, Ghani is interested not only in finding a durable solution to the problem of Islamic extremism, but also in setting his country on a path of sustainable economic development.
Afghanistan was the only state that opposed Pakistan’s entry into the United Nations when it gained independence from British rule in 1947, contributing to nearly 70 years of bilateral tensions.
They are worth considering.
Climate economists widely acknowledge that there are only four policy levers that can be used in an attempt to lower carbon emissions and rein in climate change: reducing the world’s population, shrinking the global economy, increasing the efficiency of energy consumption, and decreasing carbon intensity (meaning that we create less carbon for each unit of energy that we produce).
“In short,” the report notes, “we need to ignite…an energy technology revolution.”
The issue of negotiating a rapprochement between Afghanistan’s government and the Taliban is undoubtedly controversial.
The Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan are closely integrated at the operational level, with al-Qaeda members embedded in most important Taliban field operations.
Human rights groups suspect that even if the Afghan government and Taliban representatives profess to respect the constitution in any future peace agreement, they will not enforce some of its provisions in practice.
Taming “Speculative Capitalism”
To be sure, Sarkozy is right to note the enormous risks that workers and their communities face in this rapidly globalizing world.
In an article last year in the US journal Foreign Affairs , Alan Blinder, a former advisor to President Bill Clinton and Vice-Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board, argued that the process of globalization has the potential to cause massive job loss in the future.
In fact, Blinder’s proposal is only one of many possible government policies aimed at dealing with the Internet-age turmoil in the market for jobs and livelihoods.
The financial sector and its free-market ideology had brought the world to the brink of ruin.
But, as plausible as this line of reasoning may sound, the historical evidence repeatedly refutes it.
In Europe, especially Germany, and in some quarters in the US, as government deficits and debt grow, so, too, do calls for increased austerity.
There are other measures that might help.
Taming financial markets will not be easy, but it can and must be done, through a combination of taxation and regulation – and, if necessary, government stepping in to fill some of the breaches (as it already does in the case of lending to small- and medium-size enterprises.)
The funds now rely heavily on investment from pension funds, and on money borrowed from banks and other non-private sources.
Annual profits have since risen to £190 million, but 6,000 workers have been laid off and both costs and waiting times for AA members needing its vehicle repair and recovery services have increased.
But the tide is turning against him.
We can enact measures in each of our member states and in the EU, but coordinated action by the EU and the US would be a realistic start.
Serious discussions are needed to reach EU-wide and inter-governmental agreements, and to encourage the US to move in the same direction.
Empirical studies have identified a connection between the level of executive selling and earnings manipulation – both legal and illegal.
With such advance disclosure, any inside information that the executive has when making the sale decision could emerge and become incorporated into the stock price before the payoff from the sale is determined.
BRUSSELS – Three years ago, Sri Lanka elected Mahinda Rajapaksa as president because he pledged to take the offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the guerillas who have been fighting for 25 years to carve out an independent homeland for the country’s Tamil minority.
So they have little incentive to demobilize.
Nobody should underestimate the difficulty of rebuilding Sri Lanka’s war-ravaged north and reconciling the Tamils at a time of global recession.
The alternative to such a political compromise may be a return to the tragic and bloody secessionist course that the Tigers sought for so long.
In this respect, Sri Lanka’s ability to maintain its democracy throughout decades of war gives reason for hope.
Of the world's six billion people, more than 50% live in cities and towns.
This situation will be aggravated by some of the dangers associated with a global economy led by the financial sector.
With this in mind, we used a new planning tool that allows building rights to drift. This means that we can preserve acreage for watersheds, parks, or other environmental or historical sites, but allow property owners to sell and transfer their building rights elsewhere.
It is the citizens of urban enclaves who are taking part in establishing budget priorities and counseling government through a decentralized policy of administration.
They paid no heed to the large drag that Bush's unbalancing of America's public finances will impose on the US economy over the next several decades.
At this point, I as a pundit am supposed to come up with my magic plan, my clever scheme for fixing things and putting the world to rights.
LONDON – In the early 1970’s, Saudi Arabia’s King Faisal reportedly confided to senior members of the royal family his fear that, just as in a single generation the country had moved from “riding camels to riding Cadillacs….the next generation could be riding camels again.”
The deterioration of Saudi Arabia’s political influence has contributed to a growing sense of national decline.
And some factions of the Saudi family are reaching out – albeit cautiously – to civil-society actors, attempting to engage them in a dialogue about the country’s future.
The continued absence of resolute action could easily drive Saudi Arabia toward irreversible decay.
गैर-संचारी रोगों को लक्ष्य बनाना
स्वास्थ्य के क्षेत्र में अपने अनुभव के आधार पर मैं इस निष्कर्ष पर पहुँचा हूँ कि गैर-संचारी रोगों से उत्पन्न चुनौतियों के संबंध में कार्रवाई करने में दो महत्वपूर्ण कारक उपयोगी सिद्ध होंगे। पहली और सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि प्रगति ऐसे कारगर और स्थानीय दृष्टिकोणों को तैयार करने पर निर्भर करेगी जिन्हें अपनाया जा सके, दोहराया जा सके, और बढ़ाया जा सके। मधुमेह या हृदय रोग जैसी समस्याओं के लिए सभी के लिए एक ही समाधान जैसी कोई स्थिति नहीं हो सकती। लेकिन यह देखते हुए कि गैर-संचारी रोग दुनिया भर के सभी भागों के समुदायों को प्रभावित करते हैं, ऐसा बहुत अधिक समान धरातल मौजूद है जिसकी लगातार दुबारा खोज करने की आवश्यकता नहीं है।

Even before the current crisis, Latin America’s recent “left turn” in politics was tied to the food problem.
On April 23, Brazil announced a temporary suspension of rice exports to prevent internal shortages.
Mexico, Peru, and other nations were suspicious of the anti-American rhetoric of the ALBA grouping, but some practical proposals – such as the creation of a bank of agricultural products to reduce costs for small and midsize producers – have come out of it.
But too little taxation can do the same.
Rates and rules for personal and corporate income taxes appear reasonable by international standards.
For instance a "concessionary duty rate" of 8% is levied on categories like food products, matches, cotton yarn, and computers.
As evasion increases, governments levy "additional" or "special" duties, inciting further evasion.
India's new Congress-led government, too, seems to favor these proposals.
If rich countries in Europe and North American cannot effectively tax the rich, they have little chance of preserving social democracy and offsetting the surge in inequality that has recently afflicted their economies.
The resulting lax enforcement accounts for a large portion of the one-third decline in the effective reach of the US corporate income tax since the late 1990s.
Zucman, for his part, favors a single global registry – a publicly accessible database detailing the ownership of financial instruments.
At the same time, sources of income have become more mobile: There is an increasing focus on intangible assets and mobile investment income that can easily be “optimized” from a tax point of view and transferred abroad.
This approach can also serve as a global governance model for resolving international problems.
In the future, virtually all of the information connected to a bank account will be reported to the tax authorities of the account holder’s country, including the account holder’s name, balance, interest and dividend income, and capital gains.
It leads to misallocations – and will ultimately reduce prosperity around the world.
Policy advisers argued that gaining Israel’s trust was necessary to win support for a European role in the peace process.
This is partly why Israel prefers the United States as sole mediator, and it is also why Israel’s acceptance of a monopoly role for the US evaporates as soon as any American president starts developing views different from its own.
In plain English, an “occupation tax” is needed.
This can be done if Europe supports investigations of suspected war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed by the IDF, as well as the establishment of international tribunals when such crimes occur.
But none of this was persuasive enough for Indiana primary voters, who backed his rival, State Treasurer Richard Mourdock, by an astonishing 20-point margin.
One television advertisement said it all about the low-rent cynicism of the Tea Party-driven campaign.
There was nothing like a perfectly understandable, “Sorry, we misunderstood, and are only prepared now for a bilateral session.
To be sure, the Tea Party’s brand of aggrieved populism – and its composition of mostly white, angry, middle-class voters – has deep roots in the United States, flaring up during times of change.
They view the Democrats and the Republicans alike as obstacles to change, drowning out the voices of the people as they kowtow to special interests.
For once, a grassroots movement has arisen that is composed of people – some with Ivy League degrees, but many without – who are taking seriously the Internet-age promise that you don’t have to yield leadership to an established class of politicians and pundits.
Teaching PIIGS to Fly
And the euro’s appreciation in recent years – driven in part by the European Central Bank’s excessively tight monetary policy – was the final nail in the competitiveness coffin.
The most successful programs undertaken in the presence of a risk of a fiscal and/or external debt financing crisis were those – as in Mexico, Turkey, and Brazil – where a large amount of liquidity/financing support by the IMF beefed up an increasingly credible commitment to adjustment and reform.
But that is precisely why a credible IMF program that ties financial support to the progressive achievement of fiscal and structural reform goals is the right way to teach Greece and the other PIIGS how to fly.
The difference is that this revolution's impact will be even greater.
Every industry will be at risk of being turned on its head.
On balance, the impact of technological progress will be positive.
The latest wave of technological change is far from cresting.
“The Turk” won games against the likes of Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin, while challenging many great minds to penetrate its secrets.
My Harvard colleague Kenneth Froot and I once studied the relative price movements of a number of goods over a 700-year period.
But it does not have to be that way.
Amazon, having swept away bookshops, is now laying siege to the rest of the retail sector.
Acorns, launched in 2014, already manages more than 650,000 investment accounts. The company – and others like it – are not just moving into the market; the simplified investment and savings processes they offer are expanding and transforming it.
But it would be premature to conclude that traditional banking has yielded to new financial platforms. Many of the new entrants have benefited from advantages that would be difficult to maintain were they to scale up in size and importance.
Where Will All the Workers Go?
Even the shop floor can be swept better and cheaper by a Roomba robot than by any worker.
Job-reducing technological innovations will affect education, health care, government, and even transportation. For example, will we still need so many teachers in the decades to come if the cream of the profession can produce increasingly sophisticated online courses that millions of students can take?
Child labor was abolished throughout the developed world, working hours and conditions became more humane, and a social safety net was put in place to protect vulnerable workers and stabilize the (often fragile) macroeconomy.
Without intending to (or at least without highlighting it), the survey’s authors were illuminating the distinction between knowing how to do something and actually doing it in and for the world.
In our human world, knowledge and capability imply some responsibility: If you are able-bodied and you see a person in front of you walk into the path of an oncoming car, you have a responsibility to pull that person to safety.
Countries will increasingly find that their priorities must reflect broad public sentiment rather than that of a ruling elite.
Around the entire planet, we are approaching some kind of singularity, with the market pandering to our fundamental short-term natures by offering us instant gratification and long-term destruction.
Such technologies also have critical medical uses. Simple nuclear-derived kits accelerated the detection of the Ebola virus during the recent outbreak in West Africa.
Moreover, developing countries must be allowed to determine their own priorities, and lead the way in pursuing them. Developed countries should support these efforts by transferring expertise and know-how, not simply by supplying the hardware.
CAMBRIDGE – Since the dawn of the industrial age, a recurrent fear has been that technological change will spawn mass unemployment.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, worldwide, technological change could easily lead to the loss of 5-10 million jobs each year.
Thanks partly to the availability of computer programs and online matches, there has been a mini-boom in chess interest among young people in many countries.
Technological change is not all upside, and transitions can be painful.
Humans are not horsies.
But, in Italy, one man, Mario Monti, is already making a difference.
In France, too, citizens have no illusions.
The fifth source of optimism is slightly paradoxical.
The seventh reason to believe in Europe is linked to the universalism of its message and languages.
The Greek crisis may be forcing Europe to move towards greater integration, with or without Greece.
Today’s feverish hand-wringing reflects a confluence of worries – especially concerns about inflation, excess investment, soaring wages, and bad bank loans.
Wherewithal to deliver. China’s commitment to stability has teeth.
Fears of excess investment and “ghost cities” fixate on the supply side, without giving due weight to burgeoning demand.
Education. China has taken enormous strides in building human capital.
Today’s cottage industry of China doubters is a case in point.
In the light of the Halabja atrocity, and the regime’s broader genocidal Anfal campaign against the Kurds, and massive repression throughout the country, the question “Is Iraq better off now than it was under Saddam Hussein?” requires no great deliberation.
The Sunni Arab parties initially rejected any notion of a confederated state, but in time they came to believe that the Shia parties would never share power voluntarily.
As for the economy, no one expected a replication of Germany’s post-1945 Wirtschaftswunder.
Incompetence and corruption are rampant: Iraq routinely scores among the bottom ten countries in Transparency International’s list of the most corrupt countries in the world.
CAMBRIDGE – Al Qaeda’s attack on the United States ten years ago was a profound shock to both American and international public opinion.
During the Cold War, the US had been even more vulnerable, in technological terms, to a nuclear attack from Russia, but “mutual assured destruction” prevented the worst by keeping vulnerability more or less symmetrical.
Even so, the elimination of top Al Qaeda leaders, the strengthening of American intelligence, tighter border controls, and greater cooperation between the FBI and the CIA have all clearly made the US (and its allies) safer.
To the extent that the trillion or more dollars of unfunded war costs contributed to the budget deficit that plagues the US today, Bin Laden was able to damage American hard power.
Above all, much depends on the policies adopted by the two largest economies, China and the United States, and their cooperation and leadership in creating global public goods and maintaining a stable and open economic environment.
In the past, the US brought a large open market, foreign direct investment, and technology, while China supplied low-cost labor-intensive components in key global manufacturing supply chains.
Fair, rules-based competition in a rapidly expanding global economy is far from a zero-sum game.
China’s GDP is projected to catch up to that of the US and Europe in 10-15 years, at which point (if not sooner) both Chinese and US real GDP will exceed $25 trillion (in 2012 prices), more than three times China’s current GDP.
At the same time, we are on the threshold of a new era when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force and provides fresh impetus for our external action.
The EU's joint civilian-military approach makes us flexible and able to offer tailor-made solutions to complex problems.
We have made a real difference in Africa, helping, for example, to provide a secure environment for elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo and protecting refugees and aid workers from the fall-out of the Darfur crisis.
Our ESDP missions have taken us as far afield as Aceh, Indonesia, where we monitored the peace agreement reached after the 2004 tsunami, following decades of civil war.
Clearer priorities and more sensible budgeting decisions are needed.
In 1918, Oswald Spengler published The Decline of the West.
This is not the “peripheral” trouble that Francis Fukuyama envisioned in his 1989 manifesto “The End of History.”
It is unlikely that US policymaking reflects the grip of some ideal view of the world, in which getting rid of dictators is the same thing as creating democracies.
Fitting a rising power into a decaying international system has rarely occurred peacefully.
But I doubt it.
Agreement is uncertain.
This dilemma underscores the difficulty in crafting a democratization strategy for so vast a region as "the Greater Middle East," which stretches from Mauritania to Pakistan.
The priority in fighting terrorism should be police and intelligence service cooperation, which produces much faster results and limits the capacity of extremists to mobilize.
· Capitalize on institutional diversity. Because NATO and the EU share complementary priorities, both can develop mechanisms for inclusive security cooperation in peacekeeping operations.
9/11 remains the date that has come to signify modern terrorism in all of its terrible capacity to cause death and destruction.
None of this should make anyone sanguine.
Similarly, elections in Palestine did not persuade Hamas to turn its back on violence any more than elections in Lebanon dissuaded Hezbollah from initiating the current crisis in the Middle East.
Terrorism can now be carried out with boxcutters and airplanes as easily as with explosives.
The aim must be to create an environment in which terrorism is seen as neither acceptable nor necessary.
The French Climate-Terror Connection
The surge in carbon dioxide emissions has been fueled not just by industrialization; the UN expects Earth’s human population to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100.
After all, to improve their health and preserve their environment, people need access to information about birth-control methods, modern farming and cooking practices, and much else. And to improve their economic prospects, they need the knowledge and skills that employers require.
For starters, there is the sheer scale of the humanitarian catastrophe. Since 2009, Boko Haram alone has killed more than 10,000 people in Nigeria and has driven nearly a half-million from their homes.
In April, the country was granted $170 million in debt relief – the payoff for years of economic reform. But now it is being forced to use part of its hard-won fiscal space to finance the fight against terror.
Testing America’s Financial Stability
Under the new act, a systemic risk regulator has been established, oversight of the shadow banking sector has been strengthened, and new mechanisms have been created to deal with the failure of systemically important non-banks.
Third, reducing systemic risks will require determined action to ensure that financial institutions are not too big to fail.
Most people are surprised to learn that rigorous application of formal rules of evidence to evaluate medical research and decide on the best treatments is a recent phenomenon.
Similarly, cardiologists once prescribed drugs to reduce sudden death in patients after heart attacks.
Public funding also benefits a country’s economy, because large employers are spared the expense of providing health benefits to their workers.
While for-profit providers have higher administrative costs and larger executive salaries, their main burden relative to not-for-profit provision is the need to generate returns for their shareholders.
Russian bombs and missiles are now raining down on an array of armed groups that have been fighting Syrian government forces, which has given the regime the breathing space that Russia’s intervention was intended to provide.
Indeed, there have been reports of the Islamic State moving into areas that others have abandoned following Russian attacks.
Even this modest aim will prove costly, because the Islamic State is also becoming stronger.
A Syria of enclaves or cantons may be the best possible outcome for now and the foreseeable future.
Yet considerable uncertainty remains about the magnitude of the impact of rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases on temperatures and climate.
To prevent further climate change, the IPCC believes, emissions should be brought down to 2.3 tons per person globally, or roughly half the current per capita average, in the next 50 to 75 years.
This is one reason why successful mitigation at the global level faces stiff headwinds.
This will surely involve sharp cuts in the consumption of fossil fuels, bolstered by taxes and other restrictions.
Indeed, there is no need to embellish the political message for China.
Instead of multi-party politics, Mill favored democratic elections constrained by such mechanisms as extra votes for the educated and institutional mechanisms to protect the rights of minorities.
As it happens, the Chinese Communist Party is becoming more meritocratic.
Instead, for a half-century, an unspoken social contract among four broad groups has held Thailand together: the “Palace” – a euphemism used here to avoid violating draconian lèse majesté laws; big business, the custodian of economic growth; the military, which ensures, first and foremost, the sanctity of the Palace and the moral values it represents; and the common people, mostly rural and urban poor, who accept the rule of the other three estates.
In the current crisis, army generals have told the public that they are reluctant to use force, a position that was not theirs to take.
Such wrenching sights are typically accompanied by the pungent odor of a sewage system that is more a problem than a solution, especially during the rainy season.
The red shirts are not blind to Thaksin’s excessive corruption.
More than 60 people, including two foreign reporters and a few soldiers, died in the Thai army’s suppression of the urban rebellion.
It is entirely plausible that Thaksin did help finance the protest.
This patronizing view conveniently ignores the fact that in the last four elections, Thaksin and his allies won by lopsided margins.
But the country’s underclasses must see long-overdue and concrete changes in the right direction – that is, furthering what Thaksin tried to do.
While the rural population had more than enough to eat, their economic opportunities and upward mobility were limited by a shoddy education system and docile state-run media that fed them soap operas and official messages.
Thai Rak Thai’s populism featured income redistribution, cheap health care, micro-credit schemes, and a dazzling array of policy innovations that ushered Thailand into twenty-first-century globalization.
In the process, what had been a pro- and anti-Thaksin fight has gradually become a pro- and anti-monarchy struggle.
The reds will need to distance themselves from Thaksin’s abuses of power as much as the yellows will have to accept some of Thaksin’s policy legacy, particularly grassroots opportunities for jobs, education, and upward mobility.
The current crisis has been brewing for some time, but the breaking point came when anti-government protestors occupied Bangkok’s main airport.
Once in power, he essentially shut them out of the “grabbing” game, preserving it for himself and his cronies.
These protests have run, on and off, for nearly 200 days, with crowd sizes ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands.   It is widely known that the anti-Thaksin business elites provided the money to keep people in the street.
HONG KONG – Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was gracious when he ended his exile in Hong Kong: “Thank you, Hong Kong, for having me here, so warmly.
None of the four “tiger” economies – Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea – were as blessed with natural resources and fertile soil.
Yet several South Korean companies, such as Samsung and Hyundai, have become global household names competing successfully against far more established brands, such as Sony and Honda.
Competition is not a zero-sum game.
But how realistic is it to expect so driven and flamboyant a man to stay away from the limelight?
Thaksin’s ownership of the Manchester City football club might not seem of great importance to observers outside Thailand and Asia. But Thais are soccer enthusiasts and even bigger fans of the English Premier League.
The situation is all the more uncertain in view of a problem facing the PPP.
In Russia, the task is especially problematic, because the ruling elite’s interests run counter to undertaking it.
Vertical industrial policy, horizontal industrial policy, investment in education – all have been tried in the last ten years.
So far, the government does not want to let control over these firms get into private hands.
That Old Tax Magic
Romney wants to cut tax rates, mainly benefiting those at the upper end of the income distribution.
Everyone has an agenda, perceived or real.
If one presidential candidate refuses to cooperate in this manner, that should confer an advantage on the candidate who is willing to disclose more fully the specifics of his plan.
Then came Japan’s terrible earthquake, which severely damaged both its economy and global supply chains.
Global risk-aversion has also increased, as the option of further “extend and pretend” or “delay and pray” on Greece is becoming less desirable, and the specter of a disorderly workout is becoming more likely.
Indeed, inflation may even force the Bank to raise interest rates by the fall.
If that happens, the risk of stall speed or an outright double-dip recession would rise sharply in many advanced economies.
Before 1986, there were brokers, acting for clients, and jobbers, making a market, and never the twain could meet.
(Full disclosure: I was an adviser to Lawson in the 1980’s).
Thatcher was referring specifically to the dangers of fixed exchange rates, and can certainly not be counted as one of the principal architects of the so-called “efficient markets hypothesis.”
Her Alan Greenspan-like belief in the self-correcting features of financial markets, and her reverence for the integrity of the price mechanism, do not look as well-founded today as they did in the 1980’s.
But by now, the decline has become nearly universal, with huge implications for global asset markets.
But Glassman and Hassett did have a point.
To my mind, though, the greatest risk is geopolitical instability. By and large, China has been a far more constructive counterpart to the US than the former Soviet Union ever was.
The Chinese are no strangers to Rwanda.
One big change is in education.
Of course, technology transfer from China and India could be a mere smokescreen for a new “brown imperialism” aimed at exploiting African oil, food, and minerals.
Americans do-gooders like Nicholas Negroponte, with his $100 laptop, have identified the right problem: Africa is way behind technologically and rapid leap-frogging is possible.
When, in the 1970’s, the Club of Rome issued its famous report on the “Limits to Growth,” the reaction was one of concern.
Steadily rising prices of raw materials, agricultural products, and energy already reflect fears about future shortages.
The same pattern holds true for Europe and Japan, albeit on a slightly smaller scale.
Human population has simply become too large to be able to afford it.
This is precisely what needs to change.
And, like past insurgencies, the Iraq conflict is one in which the insurgents use horrific acts to intimidate the public, expose the shortcomings of the government, and goad the regime into overreactions that might turn the public against it.
Multiple insurgencies co-exist in time and space, each with differing objectives and tactics.
Finally, the insurgency as a whole remains nihilistic, focused on destroying the new Iraqi government and the emerging economic and political system rather than articulating a coherent alternative.
It is not clear at this point how much determination Iraq’s emerging democratic leaders will have.
The deeper the plunge, the stronger the rebound, some analysts say.
If authorities set the clock back several decades on banking regulation, can we be so sure they will not also set the clock back on income?
Chinese growth is set to slow over the longer run, as well.
Assuming continuing reforms in countries such as Brazil, India, South Africa, and Russia, emerging markets could well fill some of the growth gap left by the largest economies.
Africa’s poverty rate in 2003 exceeds that of the next poorest region, South Asia, by 17 percentage points.
In 2004, for example, Chad’s 39.4% annual growth rate contrasted sharply with Zimbabwe’s -6.8% economic contraction.
In 2004, only six countries – Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Ethiopia, Angola and Mozambique – had annual growth rates higher than 7%.
Moreover, there must be greater balance between capital-intensive and labor-intensive activities.
For Americans, especially, it was the totemic emblem of victory in the Cold War.
“When does it take effect?” reporters asked. Confused, Schabowski neglected the all-important date: “ sofort ,” he said.
The Communists, not the people, would have done it.
Finally, it gave way and was hoisted above the crowds, twisting slowly, as if from a gibbet.
The answer seems to consist in those countless individual choices at key moments, the accidents of human messiness, such as Schabowski’s “botch,” so small and so understandable, yet so earthshaking. Among them, too, were the choices of courageous protestors to go into the streets, to speak out – or, as this particular protestor put it to me, not to have to explain to the next generation, “We sat and waited.”
Another year passed before his office issued indictments against high-ranking figures responsible for major crimes.
It also provided impetus to the establishment of the International Criminal Court, while encouraging prosecutors in many countries to charge senior officials and guerrilla leaders for war crimes and bring them to trial in national courts.
Her mother, Mrs. Watanabe, is known for moving the world’s markets with the financial trading that occupies her breaks from housework.
The only difference from her mother’s era was that today’s generation quit, married, and gave birth later.
Previously, the LDP had given barely a second thought to women’s issues, focusing only on the needs of business and dealing with an aging society. Now, to Ms. Watanabe’s surprise, it has made women’s policy one of the key aspects of its long-term strategy.
Abe has said that “womanomics” is the most important pillar of “Abenomics,” his government’s growth strategy.
To him, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is another Hitler, and the world is now facing the same challenges that it faced on the eve of Hitler’s rise to power.
Begin was the best proof that Israel’s critics needed that the Zionist revolution, although it created a state out of the ashes of the Holocaust, had failed to eradicate the collective self-image of the Jew and the Israeli as victim.
When he did not feel the need to exploit the solemnity of Holocaust remembrance ceremonies, Barak conveyed the right message to the rising Iranian power.
A Year of Reckoning for France and Europe
Hollande’s government insists that we will be successful only if three conditions are met.
Our duty is to rise to the occasion and reverse the tide.
We have designed the corporate-tax credit to maximize its positive impact on the economy: labor costs will fall immediately without depressing aggregate demand in 2013, because the spending cuts (€10 billion) and household tax increases that will fund the credit will begin only in 2014.
The Accidental Empire
When financial markets discovered that supposedly riskless government bonds might be forced into default, they raised risk premiums dramatically.
This trend has gathered momentum in recent months.
The political and social dynamics are also working toward disintegration.
German authorities are working feverishly to come up with a set of proposals in time for the European Union summit at the end of June, but all signs suggest that they will offer only the minimum on which the various parties can agree – implying, once again, only temporary relief.
When the German people become aware of the consequences –&nbsp;one hopes not too late – they will want to correct the defects in the euro's design.
If Western women have learned anything in the past 40 years, it is how to be unsatisfied with the status quo – an important insight for the rest of the world, as we seek to export Western-style feminism.
Many men and women in the rest of the world – especially in the developing world – observe this in us and are ambivalent about it.
It is not necessarily a victory for women – or men – that, 40 years on, professional women are just as exhausted as professional men traditionally have been.
Perhaps seeing how futile it is to rest one’s sense of self on externalized, professionalized achievement is a wake-up call – and a first step to a deeper freedom, and an even deeper sense of feminine destiny.
We must not ignore the grave dangers that it would pose for Pakistan, where a new round of jihadist rhetoric and mobilization could be fatal to hopes of building a stable and more secure country.
It is equally important that Pakistan and India engage in an open dialogue that can establish trust and transparency in their respective policies concerning Afghanistan. Today, this dialogue hardly exists, and their mutual maneuvering, fueled by mistrust, could easily destabilize their weaker neighbor.
What we must do now is create the framework for a more stable Afghanistan, and for sustained international engagement in a region that is crucial for global stability.
But, when communism collapsed in its Eurasian heartland, the West’s rich, believing that they had nothing more to fear, pressed to roll back the welfare state, causing inequality to rise rapidly.
Theirs is a movement of political reform – demanding more freedom and government accountability – not of social protest, at least not yet.
This is becoming particularly relevant today, as the smell of war hangs over Iran.
NEW YORK – The world is speeding up. Communications, travel, and productivity are increasing.
Meth users often develop rotten teeth and horrible scabs caused by scratching themselves due to a sensation of insects crawling under their skin.
That’s one-quarter of all amphetamines seized in the world.
With little initial investment, industrial-scale factories can make huge profits by manufacturing millions of tablets.
Greater regional cooperation is needed to prevent such displacement.
But it is also evidence that the US is trying to pursue the right policy.
If the choice for Islamists is still bullets or ballots, bullets may now look more promising.
The US should therefore declare that it will cut off its aid to Egypt’s military at a specified date unless elections take place.
Over the longer term, an elected government will have to bring enough parts of Egyptian society together to be able to make tough choices about dismantling the military’s corrupt state within a state, cutting subsidies, and rebuilding the economy’s foundations.
The guests that Faisal Qassem brought to the Doha studios (or via satellite) included people from the same Arab country or region but representing completely opposing points of view.
When Al Jazeera reporters interviewed Osama bin Laden and the station broadcast his videos, America’s gloves came off.
Al Jazeera has made Qatar famous and the Arab world better informed. Despite its inadequacies and biases, Al Jazeera has changed the Arab world for the better.
Asian countries have impressive potential resources for soft power.
Japan’s global cultural influence grew in areas ranging from fashion, food, and pop music to consumer electronics, architecture, and art.
Japan’s culture remains inward-looking.
But the real promise for China and India lies in the future.
Indeed, if the US continues to pursue unattractive policies, it may find that its absence from the summit in Malaysia in December is a harbinger of things to come.
When Putin welcomed Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez to Russia last September, he observed that, “Latin America is becoming a noticeable link in the chain of the multipolar world that is forming.”
Instead, Russia’s leaders are busy protecting Russian markets, banks, and companies from the worst effects of the global financial crisis, consolidating state control over domestic economic sectors, and extending their foreign-policy leverage across former Soviet territory.
Who, then, can take the lead on efforts to create a new global financial architecture that reflects the complexities of twenty-first-century commerce?
Examples include the war in Iraq, launched by the US on false premises, obstructionism on efforts to curb climate change, meager development assistance, and the violation of international treaties such as the Geneva Conventions.
These anti-scientific approaches affected not only climate policy, but also foreign policy.
They reject geological evidence of climate change because they reject the science of geology itself.
In many statements, Palin seems intent on invoking God in her judgments about war, an ominous sign for the future if she is elected.
The American Leader We Need
A new president’s first task will be to return America’s economic competitiveness and self-confidence. It will not be easy to rein in over-spending and over-borrowing, to restore the real family values of saving, thrift, responsibility, and fair reward.
It won’t work.
In the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered wise advice to the next US president upon his retirement. Israel and Palestine have become, he said, the hopeless and bloody prism through which American diplomacy often seems to see the world.
It is easy to forget how critical things were back in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.
As they intervened, American policymakers consulted closely with their counterparts around the world, urging them to take supportive steps.
And, sensing all of this, companies are beginning to deploy the massive precautionary cash balances that they have accumulated.
For starters, the economy is not yet in a position to handle the 4-5%-of-GDP “fiscal cliff” that is approaching as all of the hard political decisions that were postponed come into view at the end of this year.
The American Way of Debt
This may already be happening: the appreciation of the euro, from $1.20 to $1.30 in the past few months, was enough to bring European growth to a standstill during the third quarter of this year.
The third option is a pick up of growth in Europe, which would increase US exports.
Until this happens, it is in the rest of the world's interest to let the US continue to run an unprecedented current account deficit by financing it at the rate of $500 billion per year.
Indeed, President Nicolas Sarkozy’s willingness to intervene (alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron) helped close a dangerous gap between the world of “values,” which would call for direct American intervention against Muammar el-Qaddafi, and the world of “interest,” which impelled President Barack Obama to restraint.
The view from London contains the same element of “distance” – if not slight apprehension – found in the view from Washington.
At the crossroads of this question stands NATO, an organization perceived as American by Europeans and international (i.e., not American) by the average US citizen.
The Anarchist and the President
Correa, who has tightened the screws on his country’s press, hardly stands as the flag-bearer for the libertarian tradition of the press that Assange, the poster boy of “stateless” journalism, represents.
Indeed, he has virtually written the playbook for discouraging the kind of journalism championed by WikiLeaks.
Fortunately for Assange, a sympathetic president was willing to throw him a lifeline as he floundered in the treacherous waters of international law.
For several months, Russian and Chinese obstruction in the United Nations Security Council was both a real obstacle to more effective sanctions and a convenient veil for inaction.
The army and the security apparatus remain loyal, the cabinet has suffered few defections, and the key population centers of Damascus and Aleppo have not joined the rebellion.
In this context, it is important to appreciate the difference between the “political” opposition and the local opposition groups waging the fight against the regime on the ground.
As the sanctions imposed on Iran outside the Security Council clearly show, effective action can be taken to tilt the balance and end the deadly stalemate in Syria.
China’s leaders oppose stiffer sanctions against North Korea for a simple reason: they fear the frailty of Kim Jong-un’s regime more than they fear the international security consequences of the missile launch.
The primary cause of the regime’s fears is growing political uncertainty, which is the direct result of the failing health of Kim Kyong-hui, Kim Jong-un’s aunt and the power behind the throne.
The Anatomy of Slow Recovery
This is, I think, the best metric to use to quantify the decidedly sub-par pace of today’s jobless recovery in the US.
From an entrepreneurial standpoint, therefore, recovery was a straightforward matter: simply pick up where you left off and do what you used to do.
Unfortunately, the market cannot produce a demand recovery rapidly by itself.
In London, Prime Minister David Cameron is on the offensive.
Indeed, the Bank of England’s latest inflation report makes it clear that, in such a context, interest-rate hikes are likely.
The budget debate is now in full swing.
The question is whether they care about the deficit.
Sometimes the cause is government guarantees. And sometimes it is simply a long run of good fortune, which leaves the market dominated by unrealistic optimists.

Second, regardless of whether modern macroeconomists attribute our current difficulties to causes that are “patently unrealistic” or simply confess ignorance, why do they have such a different view than we economic historians do? Regardless of whether they have rejected our interpretations and understandings or simply have built or failed to build their own in ignorance of what we have done, why have they not used our work?
If modern macroeconomists do not reconnect with history – if they do not realize just what their theories are crystallized out of and what the point of the enterprise is – then their profession will wither and die.
This is a sizeable commitment, but it may not be enough – more needs to be done to increase agricultural production, to free up the potential of trade to address food insecurity, and to deal with the increasing impact of climate change on agriculture.
The impact of biodiversity is often insufficiently understood, which means that we have undervalued its contribution to tackling global challenges.
Next week, when leaders meet in Rome, I hope that we will agree on the key priorities to fight hunger and food insecurity, and in particular to establish an authoritative source of advice on food security to governments and international institutions.
At best, democracy is still off in the distance: the military still dominates in Egypt and Tunisia, tribal forces are on the rise in Libya and Yemen, and sectarian divides between Sunni and Shia are likely to dominate politics in Bahrain, as they have in Iraq since 2003.
Like Egypt’s now-deposed President Hosni Mubarak, al-Zawahiri’s tone was patronizing and condescending.
There is certainly a degree of envy for what others have accomplished and a sense of desperation about how Al Qaeda can capitalize on this change.
The alternative is a world in which we remain hostage to the region’s pathologies, which provide ample opportunity for Al Qaeda to reassert its narrative and influence.
Indeed, exceptions to this pattern are rare: South Africa is one, owing to the genius of one of the century’s most outstanding statesmen, Nelson Mandela.
As if this were not enough, some countries – including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and even tiny (but very rich) Qatar – have ambitions to be regional powers.
Frontline states like Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan will not manage to remain aloof from a disintegrating Syria.
But, as the recent United Nations Security Council debates on the Arab Spring have shown, it is not the major emerging countries that will influence events in the region.
Moreover, the associated MEDA funding mechanism crucially and specifically included the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
Education remains a key area where the EU should contribute to the development of the southern neighborhood, if only because young people are a growing majority of the Arab population.
Europe now faces key decisions that concern both its values and its interests in the Arab world, and the reconciliation of its short- and long-term objectives.
In April 2011, Tunisian women successfully pressed for an electoral-parity law, thanks to which they won 49 of 217 parliamentary seats in last October’s elections.
But the new president, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, has ordered the parliament to reconvene.
The National Council for Women has been restructured, there is a new Egyptian Feminist Union, and a number of coalitions made up of feminist NGOs have been created.
An immense effort would be required of women’s-rights activists to be prevent a reign of injustice.
And in Libya, while getting rid of Muammar el-Qaddafi is a good first step, democracy and the rule of law are, to be optimistic, years away.
But what about the more frequent Sunni attacks? Where is their support coming from?

Perhaps, given the ongoing turmoil in the Arab world, security services that had previously – though sometimes reluctantly – shut down these money flows are now distracted by other, more immediate, problems.
Being descendants of the Prophet, as in Morocco and Jordan, or having custodianship of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as in Saudi Arabia, bestows a legitimacy on the countries’ rulers that is directly linked to Islam.
So the tremendous victory of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Al-Nour Party in Egypt – as well as that of Ennahda in Tunisia – should come as no surprise.
That has changed, and we see the region’s imperially imposed frontiers being called into question.
The end of communist autocracies in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and even Czechoslovakia brought about a dramatic wave of state creation.
· a monopoly over the use of legitimate force;
Moreover, Arafat contributed to the absence of a legitimate monopoly of force by ignoring the semi-autonomous armed actions of his own Fatah-based militia, as well as the Fatah-based Al–Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, not to mention other groups’ armed militias.
Palestine also has a powerful women’s movement (Palestine being the first Arab country to give women the vote, in 1946).
But this was an asymmetrical peace. Both countries recognized Israel, but Israel did not recognize Palestine, and Israel’s construction of settlements on occupied land continued.
The predominant image is of a passive, exotic, and veiled victim-woman who reacts to events instead of actively participating in them. She is an impersonal object of communal stereotypes that sustain cultural prejudices.
This new family model has gained so much force that it is imposing itself on rural society, too, where the decline of the agrarian economy is accompanied by a strong shift towards smaller families.
The result is widespread invocation by governments of religious norms, and to a lesser extent references to tradition, in order to legitimize the continuation of patriarchal rule.
LONDON – Economic want and inequality, as much as political repression, incited the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions.
Although birth rates are falling, one-third of the overall population is below 15 years old, and large numbers of young women are reaching reproductive age, or soon will be.
The worldwide cost of infrastructure capable of responding to the intensifying water crisis could amount to trillions of dollars, and its development would itself be energy-intensive.
All of this means not only that the era of cheap oil is over, but also that, within the next decade or so, major oil-producing countries will struggle against costly geological constraints.
Egypt’s population, for example, more than doubled over the course of Hosni Mubarak’s rule, from 42 million in 1980 to 85 million in 2010.
The problem of high youth unemployment is certainly not confined to the developing world, however.
While the private sector must create most of the jobs, the public sector must create the underlying conditions for high productivity.
The result is a growing youth unemployment crisis among poor and working-class youth.
There can be no better way to use the region’s resources than to ensure that its young people’s lives are enriched by education, skills, and high-quality jobs.
The position of the commander of the Palestinian forces supposedly puts the various Palestinian military, security, and intelligence units under one leader, who is expected to ensure the rule of law.
A worldwide assembly chooses Fatah’s 100-member revolutionary council, which in turn elects a 20-member central committee, where most of the power struggle will take place.
The problem is that no Palestinian leader, no matter who he is, can deliver these changes.
The paradox of fire stems from its role as the great shape-shifter of natural processes.
There is no solution to fire, because there are many kinds of fires, and they change with their context.
Our prevailing templates for describing fire are similarly misdirected.
The nature of such fuel accumulations runs the gamut, including swamp drainage in Indonesia, rainforest destruction in Amazonia, self-thickening woods in American wildlands as a result of fire exclusion, and everywhere the intrusion of urban sprawl and fire-prone houses.
We will win battles but kill crews in a war that does not exist.
That, in a nutshell, is the problem that both Asia and the West face in China, and which has been demonstrated once again at the G20 summit in Canada.
The biggest loser from the global financial crisis, in China’s view, is Uncle Sam. That the US remains dependent on China to buy billions of dollars worth of Treasury bonds every week to finance its yawning budget deficit is a sign of shifting global financial power – which China is sure to use for political gain in the years ahead.
Yet the plain truth is that America’s economic and military travails are crimping its foreign-policy options vis-à-vis China.
By contrast, Japan has remained a fully pacifist economic power.
While the City of London was shaken by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the run on HBOS, Sotheby’s staged a record-breaking auction for the works of the artist Damien Hirst, which produced a gross take of around $200 million.
Financial judgment, by contrast, is not by its nature open to inspection.
Naïve outsiders found the world of contemporary art bewildering.
One hint was that Russian buyers paid the big money, at the very moment that Russia’s banking system was melting down.
Both American presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, have made clear that they expect the Pakistani government to take action against militants, and that they would be willing to authorize strikes inside Pakistan.
In 2005 alone, EU imports from Pakistan totaled €3.4 billion.
Such a commission, with senior European members, could examine the key issues in the region, visit all countries and players and develop a set of recommendations for a new transatlantic approach to begin in early January 2009 when a new U.S president is in place.
In July 1997, the Thai Baht plummeted. Soon after, financial panic spread to Indonesia and Korea, then to Malaysia.
Today, the global surfeit of liquidity has once again resulted in comparably low risk premia and a resurgence of capital flows, despite a broad consensus that the world faces enormous risks (including the risks posed by a return of risk premia to more normal levels.)
Developing countries have also increasingly borrowed in their own currencies during the last few years, thus reducing their foreign exchange exposure. For those developing countries that remain heavily indebted abroad, an increase in risk premia would almost certainly bring economic turmoil, if not crisis.
It was not an accident that the only two major developing countries to be spared a crisis were India and China.
His novel Autumn of the Patriarch captures perfectly the moral squalor, political paralysis, and savage ennui that enshrouds a society awaiting the death of a long-term dictator.
The Khrushchev thaw that followed may have been short-lived, but for the first time in Soviet history the possibility of change was opened – a possibility that Mikhail Gorbachev seized upon in 1985.
Little did Franco realize that what Juan Carlos would build, with the help of a clever young Franco-era bureaucrat named Adolfo Suarez, was the modern, democratic Spain of today.
Many observers portray Raúl Castro, Fidel’s younger brother and designated heir, as a pragmatist – the “practical Castro.”
WASHINGTON, DC – Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has now made the mistake that all Iranian presidents make: he has challenged the authority of the country’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He is doomed to fail.
He has supported factionalization in the government, and, when necessary, has weakened factions that he previously supported. Most importantly, he has ensured that Iran’s presidents remain weak, regardless of their agenda or popularity.
Only those with a strong background in intelligence or the Revolutionary Guards, and a low profile in domestic politics, need apply.
The regime’s propaganda machine is already portraying the Istanbul talks as a triumph for the Islamic Republic and a setback for the West.
Regardless of their outcome, the new negotiations have put Khamenei in a perilous position.
It is an open secret in Iranian political circles that Khamenei also regrets permitting volunteers of the Basij militia to attack the British embassy last November.
The problem for Khamenei – and thus for those negotiating with Iran – is that there is scant benefit for him in success.
When a would-be dictator – anywhere, any time, on the right or the left – wants to close an open society or initiate a crackdown against a democracy movement, he follows ten classic steps: invoke a threat, create secret prisons, develop a paramilitary force, establish a surveillance apparatus, arbitrarily detain citizens, infiltrate citizen groups, target key individuals, go after journalists, call criticism “treason,” and subvert the rule of law.
Iran’s citizens – and all people longing to resist a tyrannical government or to protest in an established democracy – should bear that lesson in mind.
What a real revolution it would be if the Western democracies did indeed begin to frame their foreign policies with human rights and democratic processes as their benchmark.
Even more important has been the growing gap between average (mean) and median income: that is, the proportion of the population living on half or less of the average income in the US and Britain has been growing.
The greater the knowledge, skill, and responsibility attached to a job, the higher the acceptable and accepted reward for doing it.
The attitude of indifference to income distribution is in fact a recipe for economic growth without end, with the rich, very rich, and super-rich drawing ever further ahead of the rest.
Mistaken beliefs, on the other hand, are reflected in metaphors like “contagion” and “domino effect,” which imply that financial markets become blind, virulent, and indiscriminate when they are disturbed.
One group – Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania (BELL) – experienced a surge in yields on their government bonds in 2009, followed by a sharp decline.
In Japan, QE may have contributed to delays in economic reform and restructuring, thereby weakening longer-term economic growth and exacerbating fiscal distress.
Slovenia is in the European Union, Croatia is very close to membership, and all of the region’s other countries have started along the EU path.
That is why, at the EU-United States summit held in Prague last year, I proposed an eight-pronged initiative, elements of which have now been fully or partially taken up, including the Conference held in Sarajevo last June where the EU reiterated its commitment to the integration process of the Balkans region as whole.
The EU has offered to play a facilitating role: we urge both leaderships to promptly seize this opportunity, with a view to their states’ further steps along the path towards the European family to which all Balkan countries naturally belong.
But the reality is less re-assuring.
Bosnia and Kosovo are trapped in the labyrinth of the politics of semi-independence; Albania, Montenegro, and Macedonia are small and claustrophobic republics with populist and divisive governments and opposition forces that are discouraged and discouraging at the same time.
Moreover, they no longer know how their economies will be able to grow in post-crisis Europe.
This should change.
Moreover, whereas members of all ethnic groups committed crimes, in its first years, the ICTY indicted and prosecuted far more Serbs than others, fueling a perception, even among opponents of Milosevic’s regime, that the tribunal was political and anti-Serbian.
Holding the trial in Belgrade might have served better to catalyze a sober examination of the past. The atmosphere was certainly favorable.
As one Kosovo Liberation Army commander warned, “If we kill one KFOR soldier a day, these cowards will leave.”
The people of the Balkans should feel that the EU offers them political and economic support.
Compared to Saddam Hussein's murderous old regime at Abu Ghraib, of course, American prisons are relatively well managed.
Texas prison guards regularly rely on excessive force, the judge concluded, officials ignore sexual enslavement, and the state's isolation units function as "virtual incubators of psychoses."
Why do prisons the world over concentrate such suffering and misconduct? Partly by design.
A flurry of investigations will now try to figure out what went disastrously awry at Abu Ghraib.
Twenty years ago, such developments would have interested mostly bankers and businesspeople.
This is monetary policy on steroids, and, to opponents of inflation-inducing money creation, it amounts to playing with fire.
For example, the Fed’s mandate dictates that price stability can be explicitly linked to active support for GDP growth and employment; for the BoE and the ECB, it can be a condition for achieving the broader goal of sustainable growth and employment.
BARCELONA – Central bankers and regulators tend to worry that too much competition in the financial sector increases instability and the risk of systemic failure.
This new vulnerability stands in stark contrast to the stability of the over-regulated post-World War II period.
As a result, investment-banking operations might need to be rescued if they pose a systemic threat.
The crisis has affected both concentrated banking systems (for example, the UK and the Netherlands) and non-concentrated systems (e.g., the US and Germany).
GENEVA – Now that the global financial crisis is abating, it is time to take stock of our mistakes and ensure that they are not repeated.
Clearly the Fund’s surveillance of the US economy was ineffective, and its multilateral surveillance of financial markets no better.
It is inconceivable that the Fund, with its qualified and dedicated staff, would have failed so miserably in detecting and calling attention to the vulnerabilities piling up in the US mortgage market had they occurred in a developing country.
Perhaps most revealingly, though, Rajan nonetheless optimistically argued that “[d]eregulation has removed artificial barriers preventing entry of new firms, and has encouraged competition between products, institutions, markets, and jurisdictions.”
Whereas Tunisia and Egypt are relatively homogeneous countries – Sunni Muslims constitute more than 90% of their inhabitants – Bahrain’s Sunnis, including the royal family and the country’s political and economic elite, comprise only about one-third of the population.
From the turmoil in the 1920’s, following administrative reforms, to labor protests in the 1950’s, the country is accustomed to agitation. As a result, factional strife is unlikely to panic the rulers and is even less likely to persuade them that the king must abdicate to save the country.

A bronze sculpture of the British prime minister had been in the Oval Office of the White House since the 1960’s.
Even Churchill himself did not speak of Anglo-Saxons much. He talked about “the British race” or the “English-speaking peoples.”
Americans, on the whole, have far less interest than the British in the “special relationship.”
Yet he likes to portray himself as a tough patriot, and Obama as an un-American wimp.
So what can be done to promote an “Americanization” of Europe in political terms and a “Europeanization” of America in social terms? Comforted by a new President who incarnates a return of hope, who inspires and reassures at the same time, Americans are starting to believe that the worst of the economic crisis is behind them.
What will they do?
But, above all, Europe suffers from an identity deficit, for no one seems to know what it means to be a European nowadays.
Some observers even speak of a “Turkish Spring.”
There is a strong leftist bent to the Turkish Spring.
Many of the new entrepreneurs, like the women in headscarves, are from villages in Anatolia.
Democracy is good, and so are liberalism and tolerance.
This is no reason to support Erdoğan and his shopping-mall builders against the protesters in Turkey, either.
Most of the previous amendments relied on agreements between governing and opposition parties, and were not put to a popular vote.
Moreover, in a case brought to the Constitutional Court, the AKP’s support for the amendment was used as evidence that the party was violating Turkey’s secular constitution.
Most important among such amendments is the repeal of Provisional Article 15, which has provided immunity from prosecution to all actors of the military regime established by the 1980 coup.
With the campaign dragging on for months, the referendum has thoroughly polarized Turkish politics.
The forces of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych foolishly stuffed ballots and intimidated the country’s electoral commission to an absurd degree.
Ukrainians know that the choice they make now, that their decision to stand firm with Viktor Yushchenko today, will determine their freedom forever, as well as the health of their nation – its independence as well as its economic strength.
We shall persist, and our democracy shall prevail.
But behind it lie two moral attitudes, which are much easier to grasp.
Similarly, before the introduction of limited liability in the nineteenth century, a company’s shareholders or partners were each liable for all of the firm’s debts, which severely restricted businesses’ willingness to borrow to finance trade.
But there is a contrary moral attitude, the essence of which is that, whereas excessive debt is to be deplored, the blame for it lies with the lender, not the borrower.
But in the borrower’s view it is usurious – taking advantage of the borrower’s desperation.
Cambodia insists that the disputed land has been under its territorial sovereignty since a landmark case decided by the International Court of Justice in 1962.
The communiqué became a lightning rod for Thaksin’s opponents at home, spearheaded by the People’s Alliance for Democracy.
The PAD has openly called for a military coup to clean up Thai politics.
Cambodia wants to multilateralize the border conflict as much as Thailand tries to limit it to bilateral negotiations.
Given its immensely greater economic and financial power, America predictably carried the day.
In any case, the only process for acting on such indicators is “peer pressure,” which is unlikely to deliver results.
The world will be better off as a result.
ANN ARBOR – The quality of refereeing at the World Cup had been a source of relief until June 18, when referee Koman Coulibaly of Mali disallowed a perfectly legitimate goal by the United States that would have given it an all-important win over Slovenia.
Alternatively, one could give each team the opportunity to challenge up to two referee decisions per game, employing video replays to review rules infractions and settle disputed calls.
These measures – and many others that include the overdue use of available technology – would augment the effectiveness of often-clueless referees, whose authority has declined sharply with the proliferation of decisive mistakes in major games and championships.
The Beauty in Ugly Elections
The majority of shortcomings resulted from organizational ineptitude.
Despite the new election law's assurance of equal coverage in the main media, government TV channels devoted more time to the pro-government parties.
Indeed, many opposition groups engaged in dirty tricks.
Turnout was relatively high, at 57% of registered, particularly given that the OSCE had intoned that "public interest does not seem to be high"; other experts wrote of "voter fatigue."
Equally important, no newspapers were closed, stories suppressed, or journalists harassed, as occurred in earlier Kazakh elections.
The debate has been most intense in the United States, where the refrain that the Constitution is not a “suicide pact” and that national security can justify extraordinary measures is heard repeatedly.
When his trial began, the prosecution tried to exclude Hamdan from the room during the testimony of a witness against him.
In order to resolve the question of whether conspiracy constitutes a crime under the laws of war, Justice Stevens followed the arguments made in the brief that I submitted on behalf of Experts on Conspiracy and the Law of War.
Conspiracy, by contrast, is suited to a legal system that emphasizes early police intervention, before criminal plans are carried out.
By contrast, India, with its firmly rooted liberal democracy, smells to some like roses.
For starters, in 2004, the Congress was challenging an incumbent government that had served for six years.
The Congress will inevitably be under acute pressure to perform, as the electorate now knows that better performance is not beyond its grasp.
Indeed, the Nehru-Gandhi condominium that has dominated Indian politics has itself undermined the party’s survival prospects by making it immensely difficult for it to recruit and develop new leaders.
These concerns are unwarranted, and discriminatory policies to restrict such investment are ill-advised.
First, China has an understandable interest in diversifying its substantial holdings of foreign-exchange reserves away from low-yielding US Treasuries to real productive assets with higher returns.
First, like all mergers and acquisitions involving both domestic and foreign investors, investments in or acquisitions of US companies by Chinese companies, whether state-owned or private, must be evaluated by the US Justice Department for their impact on market competition.

In the United States, Republicans propose to balance the budget within ten years by reforming entitlement spending and taxes (with fewer exemptions, deductions, and credits providing the revenue needed to reduce personal tax rates and a corporate rate that, at 35%, is the highest in the OECD).
Such circumstances include, first, a high debt/GDP ratio, with rising interest rates impeding growth.
After all, the current American and European economies differ in important ways from the other post-war cases – size, simultaneous consolidation in many countries, already-low interest rates, and the dollar’s status as the main global reserve currency.
While consolidation may imply some short-term costs, especially in a recession, the long-term costs of delay are large.
I thought otherwise, based on research underlying my 2009 book with Carmen M. Reinhart, This Time is Different.
As William McChesney Martin, who served as Fed Chairman in the 1950’s and 1960’s, once quipped, the central bank’s job is “to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.”
The BOJ would be right to worry, of course, if interest rates were rising because of a growing risk premium, rather than because of higher inflation expectations.
They should be spiking the punch bowl more, not taking it away.
Indeed, accurate maps break down geographic barriers, empowering individuals to reach their desired destinations, enabling businesses to reach consumers anywhere, and enriching people’s outlooks.
A keen cyclist might want a map showing bicycle paths, including information about the terrain.
To advance the world’s geographic knowledge, explorers used to have to head out to sea, enduring inclement weather and debilitating disease, unsure of where they were going – or whether they would ever return home.
At the same time, an estimated two billion people will move to cities in the next quarter-century.
For example, changes in financial markets (including the large amounts of money in sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds) provide opportunities for new development partnerships, which the New Development Bank can help to catalyze and orchestrate.
But, with the shortfall of assistance from developed to developing countries, the new bank can provide essential help to developing countries and emerging markets as they undertake smarter and more sustainable infrastructure investment for growth and poverty reduction.
These innovations have helped keep the US-China economic relationship on an even keel, even in times of tension.
We also encourage China’s active participation in the Major Economies Meeting efforts to develop a post-2012 framework for greenhouse-gas reduction.
As globalization advances and economies become more tightly integrated, worries about the effects of foreign competition – through trade or through foreign investment – have fueled economic nationalism and protectionist sentiments.
Foreign participation in the financial sector brings expertise needed to provide more efficient savings instruments, risk management, and allocation of capital.
The SED is one valuable tool in combating protectionist sentiments.
The arrest of these well-educated professionals, together with the Egyptian doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri’s role as al-Qaeda’s deputy leader, raises questions that go far beyond disaffection among Muslims and the consequences of America’s misadventures in the Middle East.
This phenomenon is not unique to Islam.
With their important role in modernization, applied scientists engage in cultural debates as well.
Professionals have been integral parts of such movements, because modernization encourages action rather than resignation.
Increasingly Islamism is becoming a form of right-wing populism.
Dulu’s story is heartbreaking – and heartbreakingly common – in the developing world: three billion people survive on diets that lack micronutrients like vitamin A and Zinc, and are at increased risk of illness from common infections like diarrheal disease, which kills nearly two million children annually.
Guided by their consideration of each option’s costs and benefits, and setting aside matters like media attention, the experts identified the best investments – those for which relatively tiny amounts of money could generate significant returns in terms of health, prosperity, and community advantages.
Should we contribute to organizations that focus on saving lives today, immediately making the world a better place (with spin-offs lasting longer), or fund education to benefit future generations?
Overall, we can typically best help through direct interventions, including micronutrient supplements, fortification, biofortification, and nutritional promotion.
In most countries, if a bank in which I place my money goes bust, the government, not the bank, compensates me.
Under the Obama-Volcker proposals, commercial banks would be forbidden to engage in proprietary trading – trading on their own account – and from owning hedge funds and private-equity firms.
The classic case is Britain’s Royal Bank of Scotland, which is not an investment bank.
Such proposed solutions assume that regulators will be able to identify excess risks, prevent banks from manipulating the regulations, resist political pressure to leave the banks alone, and impose controversial corrective measures “that will be too complicated to defend in public.”
As this clean-up from the Great Recession continues, one thing is clear: the source of global demand in the future will be the billions of consumers in Africa, China, and India.  But it will take time to activate that demand, for what is now being produced around the world for industrial-country consumers cannot simply be shipped to emerging-market consumers, especially the poorer ones among them.
This would allow the use of a less power-hungry fan instead of a compressor, and the fan could run on batteries rather than relying on the power grid.
Clearly, the Fed’s objective is to increase bond prices, in the hope that lower long-term interest rates will propel corporate investment.
They are resisting appreciation through foreign-exchange intervention and capital controls.
But this global focus on Sudan’s Darfur region, though justified, has overshadowed an even more vital issue: sustaining the quest for a broader peace in all of Sudan.
Nor should the international neglect that has for too long allowed the Darfur genocide to go unpunished recur when it comes to sustaining the quest for peace in Sudan.
More recently, leading American congressmen have been impressing on President Barack Obama the need for a muscular effort to implement the CPA.
International law and the indictment of war criminals are important for a civilized world order, but they are no substitute for active financial and political engagement to support an internationally legitimate, and urgently needed, peace accord such as the CPA in Sudan.
The annual number of housing starts has fallen by 1.2 million units, cutting annual GDP by an additional $250 billion.
As demand falls, businesses will reduce production, leading to lower employment and incomes, which in turn will lead to further cuts in consumer spending.
So it is not clear what will occur to reverse the decline in GDP and end the economic downturn. Will a sharp dollar depreciation cause exports to rise and imports to fall?
Choi also declared that even if the irregularities alleged by Gbagbo were confirmed, Ouattara still would have won enough votes to carry the election.
Indeed, in recent years an unfortunate trend has emerged in African politics: losing candidates, unhappy with their election results, unleash violence until the only option for mediators is to grant them a continued role in government.
It is vital that Africa and the international community take a stand against such strategies – not only to defend the votes of Ivorians, but as a signal to others in the future that legitimate electoral results must be respected.
Of course, the “World War” reference may be intended to create an “us” versus “them” logic, but this does not correspond to the nature of the challenge posed by radical Islam, given the complexity and the many divisions that exist within the Muslim world.
But that does not mean that we must become literally obsessed with terrorism at the expense of losing sight of broader historical challenges.
In other words, we are faced with the challenge of complexity, which requires us to ensure that a small minority is not joined by greater forces.
Likewise, while Japan has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio among rich countries, this is not a serious problem because the debt is domestically held.
Others point out that the US Fed’s “quantitative easing” efforts have been modestly successful, at best.
Recent inflation in many countries has been the result of higher commodity prices, especially fuel and food prices.
Growing income inequality in most countries before the Great Recession only made matters worse, by reducing household savings and increasing credit for consumption and asset purchases, rather than augmenting investment in new economic capacity.
But former US Federal Reserv e Chairman Alan Greenspan warns of inflationary dangers.
But monetary policy had little to do with it.
But what about the vast quantitative easing (printing of money) that has been occurring? Since the start of the crisis, the Bank of England has pumped $325 billion into the British economy, the Fed has expanded the US monetary base by close to $1 trillion, and the People’s Bank of China originated a record amount of $1.4 trillion in loans.
Flooding banks with central-bank money is no guarantee that deposits, which arise from spending or borrowing money, will increase in the same proportion.
But this should be a warning signal: to say that with unemployment now much higher, inflation is expected to remain low is really to say that there will be little recovery over the next five years.
Otherwise, their economies risk remaining stuck in recession.
This distortion is perceived to be one of the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis.
If we assume that a causal relationship exists, the European directive seems to be fairly well designed, with one main shortcoming.
In large financial institutions, however, the incentive to gamble at taxpayers’ expense does not apply only to managers; it extends to bondholders, who are de facto protected by the government.
But when it comes to immigration, there is not much in the liberal tradition to which they can turn.
From the perspective of Kantian cosmopolitanism, the least an American can do is to welcome a certain amount of immigration from Africa.
Instead, through a carefully chosen example, Straw was illustrating what it means to be open to others while expecting openness in return.
But a liberal society will allow people in and make exceptions for conditions under which they must be kept out, rather than keeping people out and making exceptions for when they should be allowed in. A liberal society will also view the world as teeming with potential that, however threatening to ways of life that are taken for granted, forces people to adapt to new challenges rather than trying to protect themselves against the foreign and unknown.
That seems unlikely.
But I see a practical turn in all this that no one has yet broached.
We have all seen Putin’s face age dramatically over the last eight years.
The New York Post, a tabloid, emitted a stream of sensational reportage claiming that 12 people had been killed and that a Saudi national was “under guard” at a Boston hospital.
American flags flew at half-mast; President Barack Obama addressed the nation; the country mourned with the families of the victims and with the young athletes who will never run again.
But America has also grown up in another way, learning to choose transparency over secrecy, and to rely on the power of its citizens.
ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN – Today’s International Monetary Fund (and, to a lesser degree, the World Bank) recall Talleyrand’s description of France’s Bourbon kings: it has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.
Indeed, the IMF’s outstanding general resource account (GRA) credits to middle-income developing countries fell by an unprecedented 91% from 2002 to 2007, as richer developing countries gained access to sources of financing that were free of the Fund’s conditionality.
Only when conditions in the country deteriorated even more in the wake of the Fund holding back on the second tranche of its loan did the IMF agree to loosen its conditions.  However in Latvia, the IMF has continued to demand austerity even in the wake of plummeting growth and rising unemployment which have lead to riots and political instability.
The Bourgeois Roots of Tunisia’s Revolution
The first president, Habib Bourguiba, was the leader of the liberation movement, which emerged victorious much more quickly – and much less violently – than its counterpart in Algeria.
The aim was to suppress any and all forms of democratic opposition.
For a brief moment, there was hope for a national-unity government, in which Ben Ali’s rump cabinet and the opposition would unite to prepare a presidential election.
The disaster, however, poses a much deeper challenge to how modern societies deal with regulating complex technologies.
And, as is often the case, a crisis in one country may go global, with many other countries radically scaling back off-shore and out-of-bounds projects.
Financial crises are almost comforting by comparison.
Until these problems are better understood, we may be doomed to a world of regulation that perpetually overshoots or undershoots its goals.
The four countries have very different economic structures: Russia and Brazil rely on commodities, India on services, and China on manufacturing.
This approach represents a 1950’s view of economic development, which has long been superseded by a more variegated perspective that recognizes a multiplicity of constraints – everything from poor governance to market failures – of varying importance in different countries.
Europe brought democratic values, social solidarity, and, for all its current problems, the century’s most impressive feat of institutional engineering, the European Union.
Crumbling BRICS
So far, the goal of “global realignment” away from the advanced countries has catalyzed these five very disparate countries’ efforts to forge their own bloc.
Is the bank supposed to serve as a counterweight to global multilateral development banks like the World Bank, or to reduce American and European dominance over the Bretton Woods institutions?
Other shared problems – such as corruption, poverty, and social underdevelopment – would be similarly difficult to address together.
NEW YORK – Whenever something bad happens – Iran moving closer to acquiring nuclear weapons, North Korea firing another missile, civilian deaths reaching another grim milestone in Syria’s civil war, satellites revealing an alarming rate of polar-ice melt – some official or observer will call upon the international community to act.
No amount of UN reform could make things fundamentally different.
The NPT allows countries the right to develop nuclear energy for purposes such as electricity generation, a loophole that allows governments to build most of what is necessary to produce the fuel for a nuclear weapon.
There is no agreement on what, if anything, constitutes an appropriate target for espionage.
But so long as “international community” is more hope than reality, multilateralism will have to become more varied.
America's courts (like Italy's courts in the case of Parmalat) will make the final judgment over criminal and civil liability under existing law.
What's true for business bosses is doubly true for presidents and prime ministers.
Similarly, at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bush appointed in the person of Harvey Pitt a fox to guard the chickens - until public outrage forced Pitt's resignation.
But the intensity of opposition in America to Bush runs deeper than any single issue.
But the next worst thing is to assume that a minor patch-up will be enough to render globalization healthy and sustainable.
Moreover, the World Trade Organization’s agenda will remain irrelevant and, in any case, deadlocked.
The restructuring of economies away from finance will necessarily take some time.
Unfortunately, many of the solutions on offer are either too timid or demand too much of a global leadership that is in short supply.
Similarly, healthy and sustainable globalization should not impose a straitjacket of common rules on everyone.
Finally, as long as China provides political, financial, and military support for Burma’s rulers, it will be all but impossible for any meaningful change to occur.
So the stakes in Burma are high for China, as are Chinese fears of about how any future “national reconciliation” government might react to China’s record of complicity with the corrupt military rulers.
The international community must make clear that China’s interests would be protected during a transition to a more open society in Burma, and that some version of the oil pipeline project will be supported by any new regime.
While President Barack Obama has released a few prisoners, notably the Chinese Uighurs, and sent another for a real trial in New York City, he is now, chillingly, signalling that he is about to begin “preventive detention,” which would empower him to hold forever an unspecified number of prisoners without charges or trials.
But, six months after he ordered an end to torture and CIA “black sites,” and promised to close Guantánamo within a year, Obama seems to be re-branding Bush’s worst excesses. He has brought in planeloads of journalists to Guantánamo Bay to show them a “safe, transparent, and humane” facility that now offers fresh baklava and video viewing from a shackled loveseat.
In fact, even the explanation of why this material is classified cannot be reproduced, because it is privileged.
The “logical conclusion,” according to Dixon, is that Khan “must be detained for the rest of his life – regardless of whether he is ever charged with a crime – because if he was ever released, nothing would prevent him from disclosing this information.
In the years 1917 to 1919, US participation in World War I and anarchist bombings after the war led to almost two thousand federal prosecutions, mass roundups of aliens, and summary deportations. During World War II, Japan’s attack on the US was followed by the internment of more than 120,000 Japanese-Americans because of their race, including many who were born in the US.
One of the three counts against Nixon in the vote to impeach Nixon by the House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee was based on such eavesdropping.
At the same time, Bush has systematically packed the federal courts with judges chosen for their readiness to defer to presidential power.
In 1919, the first edition of Democratic Caesarism , by the Venezuelan historian and sociologist Laureano Vallenilla Lanz, was published and widely circulated across the continent.
With Latin America’s most recent democratic transition, which began in the 1980’s, national constitutions and electoral laws were gradually reformed and modernized.
In a recent interview with the British journalist David Frost, Nicaragua’s President Daniel Ortega, who returned to power in 2006, declared himself in favor of immediate re-election.
All of these tasks are domestic; the danger posed by the profusion of re-elected presidents will not be checked by external forces.
The state had America’s best public schools and state universities.
With 12% of America’s population, California accounts for more than 31% of its public-assistance recipients.
The political economy of California’s budget has taken the progressive tax-and-spend experiment to the breaking point, threatening the state’s ability to fund basic services, from prisons and parks to education and health care, even those aimed at helping its most vulnerable citizens.
Among US states, California still ranks first in technology, agriculture, and entertainment.
The Carry Trade Carries On
But not all investors are able to trade derivatives.
This was not without risk.
So products were developed that allowed investors to borrow easily in several currencies at once and invest in a portfolio of high-interest-rate currencies.
This has tended to increase metals prices, fueling Australia’s large export surplus in metals.
Had I been given enough space, I would have drawn this article!
As an editorial cartoonist, I always try to find more about my subjects before rendering my final sketches.
My answer is no. The issue is therefore not about the beliefs themselves as much as it is about how the faithful deal with offense, and why.
Whether caused by drought, exhausted soils, locusts, lack of high-yield seeds, the results were the same: desperation, disease, and death.
These impoverished villages need financial help to buy vital inputs for farming and to invest in basic infrastructure such as roads and electrification.
The cost of sending such help would be around $50 million, and the benefits would be $200 million to $300 million in increased food production next year (and hence less needed in emergency food aid).
Donors should lend their support by backing long-term solutions aimed at increasing food production, slowing population growth, and mitigating long-term global climate change.
It also seemed to violate earlier agreements to cooperate with other nations through the G-20, the Financial Stability Board, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
Regulation that is not globally coordinated, they warned, would create unnecessary uncertainty, prolong financial distress, and threaten economic recovery.
When financial regulations are devised by a coterie of global regulators in distant venues, it is bankers and technocrats who gain the upper hand.
Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann has gone so far as to warn that moving in this direction would “leave us all poor.”
Moreover, Kosovo’s demographic transformation over the last 100 years, when Albanians overtook the local Serb population, partly reflects an influx of Albanians from Albania – for decades a political and economic basket case, owing to Enver Hoxha’s hermetic communism.
Even in Europe, where Catalonia and the Basque region push for secession from Spain, some in Flanders want an end to Belgium, and Scotland’s ruling Scottish National Party wants eventually to break away from Britain, support for Kosovo’s independence is far from universal.
Not knowing where the enemy is hidden within the civilian population, security forces retaliate indiscriminately.
As previous experience has shown, internal discussions on constitutional competences – essentially political navel-gazing – can distract attention from the far more pressing issues of economic growth and jobs.
Their voices, however late in the day they have come, should be heeded.
The EU is much more than a set of rules governing the internal market and the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people.
CAMBRIDGE – Governments around the world are now developing massive fiscal stimulus packages that will cause unprecedented peacetime budget deficits.
Countercyclical fiscal policy had been largely discredited because of the delays involved in implementing fiscal changes and households’ weak response to temporary tax cuts.
So there is no alternative to fiscal policy if we want to reverse the current downturn.
Although I support the need for a large fiscal package, I disagree with many of the specific features of the plans now under consideration.
The Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate Change amounts to a call to action: it argues that huge future costs of global warming can be avoided by incurring relatively modest cost today.
Cost-benefit analysis is a principal tool for deciding whether altering it through mitigation policy is warranted.
Whereas the Stern Review follows a tradition among British economists and many philosophers against discounting for pure futurity, most economists take pure time preference as obvious.
Let’s assume that costs to prevent additional accumulation of CO2 (and equivalents) come to 1% of GNP every year forever, and, in accordance with a fair amount of empirical evidence, that the component of the discount rate attributable to the declining marginal utility of consumption is equal to twice the rate of growth of consumption.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s decision to proceed with plans to seek a vote this week on recognition of Palestine at the United Nations General Assembly has come despite pressure, promises, and threats from Israel and some of its Western allies.
In fact, a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders is exactly what US President Barack Obama has called for.
Leaders of Abbas’s Fatah faction, which controls the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, and of Gaza-based Hamas have been meeting regularly to implement the Egyptian-Qatari reconciliation plan.
The Case for Re-Regulating Capital Accounts
(The same can be said of recent Japanese monetary-policy decisions.)
The effectiveness of monetary expansion could be enhanced in advanced countries by reducing the leakages generated by the carry trade and other short-term capital outflows.
A reserve requirement on cross-border flows is one of them.
Land, water, energy, and biodiversity all seem to be under greater stress than ever, and population growth appears to be a major source of that stress.
Poor farm families rely on their children for farm chores and for security when parents reach old age.
All of that growth will be in the developing world: 1.3 billion more people in Asia, 900 million more in Africa, the rest in Latin America and other regions.
But this concern can be met through increased saving by today's young and middle-aged as they prepare for retirement, and by working past the age of 65.
This explosive growth was made possible by huge advances in science and technology.
It should surprise no one that the Chechens, and other peoples of the Caucasus, do not feel very Russian.
After all, the tribute that the Kremlin pays Kadyrov and the corrupted elites of the other Caucasian republics has purchased palaces and gold pistols for men who are driving the region’s young, unemployed, and disadvantaged down the path of Islamic revolution.
He accused anonymous enemies (his anonymous “they” presumably included Western governments) of pursuing an agenda to destroy Russia, and he encouraged his security officials to push back.
Not coincidentally, the ten-year gap between summits overlaps with Russia’s re-emergence as a global player, following the trauma of the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Perhaps for this reason, there has been talk of a meeting in Astana between the presidents of Russia and France, the US secretary of state, and the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
An acceptable blueprint might emerge from high-level negotiations in Astana if it were to build on what succeeded in breaking previous negotiating deadlocks: the idea of a referendum in which the war-weary Karabakhis can determine their final status.
With interethnic tensions already on the rise, Yugoslavia was the first country to dissolve into conflict.
Everyone is afraid of China, which remains relatively peaceable, but no longer bothers to conceal its growing military capacity. With no pan-Asian security architecture expected to emerge in the near future, the West’s departure from the region is generating a security vacuum.
The first unfreezing had serious consequences. Now, global leaders must work to minimize the fallout of the second, and use all available means to prevent a third.
Their success lifted a significant share of poor Brazilians into the middle class and made Brazil an attractive destination for foreign investors.
Meanwhile, for Brazil’s new middle class, higher incomes have meant higher tax payments – and thus a growing sense of entitlement to improvements in living standards.
Meanwhile, the existing rail system is so precarious that it is impossible to travel by train from Rio de Janeiro to São Paulo or Belo Horizonte or Brasília.
CAMBRIDGE – There is now intense debate about how the pay levels of top executives compare with the compensation given to rank-and-file employees.
Moreover, firms with a high CEO pay slice are associated with lower profitability.
Lower sensitivity of turnover to performance reflects less willingness on the part of directors to discipline the CEO.
Investors and corporate boards would thus do well to pay close attention not only to the compensation captured by the firms’ top executives, but also to how this compensation is divided among them.
Poverty has grown since Chávez took office in 1998; government finances and the trade balance are more dependent on oil revenues than before, and, aside from Cuban literacy programs and neighborhood “barefoot doctor” services, the overall welfare of the poor remains the same, if not worse.
Chávez is giving away oil to Caribbean island nations and Cuba, and buying off Argentine debt to help President Nestor Kirchner’s political fortunes.
To be sure, many Latin American leaders have tried to assuage and control Chávez, and they have all failed.
But the Balakotis are taking it in their stride – nose masks are everywhere.
Temporarily birds of peace instead of war, they do immensely more to calm angry Islamists than the reams of glossy propaganda put out by the US information services in Pakistan.
Hundreds of destroyed communities are scattered deep in the mountains. We saw helicopters attempt aerial drops; landing is impossible in most places.
For me personally, there is a sense of deja vu.
According to The Economist, six of the ten fastest-growing countries in 2011 were in Africa.
In fact, foreign direct investment in Africa has been on the rise since the early 2000’s, increasing fivefold in 2000-2010.
African SMEs also point the way to dynamic, sustainable, and fair growth.
This supports the view that investments in SMEs take as much – if not more – time to return a profit than less risky investments with a wider scope.
As a result, roughly 15% of sub-Saharan African trade is intra-regional, up from only 7% in 1990.
To rein in rising house prices and pre-empt the inflationary impact of the strongly expansionary fiscal and monetary policies implemented during the global financial crisis, China’s monetary authorities began to tighten financial conditions in January 2010.
First, as China ages rapidly, the disappearance of its demographic dividend will lower potential growth significantly. Moreover, other things being equal, the extremely rapid rise in fixed-asset investment has eroded China’s investment efficiency and capital efficiency, reducing potential output growth further.
Indeed, with an increasingly lenient political regime, populism may become irresistible, while the size of the government bureaucracy may continue to bloat.
The Clinton administration had called for bold action as far back as 1993, proposing what was in effect a tax on carbon emissions; but an alliance of polluters, led by the coal, oil, and auto industries beat back this initiative.
What is required, first and foremost, are market-based incentives to induce Americans to use less energy and to produce more energy in ways that emit less carbon.
A striking fact about climate change is that there is little overlap between the countries that are most vulnerable to its effects – mainly poor countries in the South that can ill afford to deal with the consequences – and the countries, like the US, that are the largest polluters.
The time to act is now.
Even though the embargo was aimed at the US and the Netherlands, market forces shifted oil among consumers, and in the long term all consuming countries suffered shortages of supply and the same price shock.
The US imports only a small portion of its oil from the Persian Gulf.
Many of these state-owned companies in countries like Russia and Venezuela are not responding merely to market forces, but are using their newfound pricing power for political purposes.
This year, China will surpass the US in emissions of greenhouse gases.
In their wake, a notable shift has emerged, with a new generation of politicians claiming to herald a fresh approach and profound changes in French policy towards Africa.
Whatever is decided about Zimbabwe’s participation at the Cannes summit will also have an impact on plans for a major EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon this fall, during Portugal’s presidency of the EU. During the last Portuguese Presidency (January-June 2000), the EU-Africa Summit had to be cancelled because of a visa ban on Zimbabwean officials and the reluctance of Africans to attend if Mugabe was excluded.
Whatever happens regarding Zimbabwe in Cannes will directly influence the EU-Africa summit later this year. Unfortunately, that controversy may also overshadow the incipient changes in French policy.
Its impressive military strength is of limited use as an instrument of power, and its political clout has been overestimated, particularly in Syria.
Meanwhile, Syria’s civil war highlights the loss of that country’s once-considerable influence in the region.
Iraq’s Kurds may even be able to extend their influence into Kurdish-populated northern Syria, thereby becoming a more influential regional player than the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
Nevertheless, though Saudi Arabia’s soft power is waning, its massive oil wealth will likely ensure that it remains a regional heavyweight.
MADRID – The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that was reached in 2005 between mostly Christian southern Sudan and the country’s Muslim North, ended one of the bloodiest civil wars in modern times.
The 2.5 million Southern Sudanese known to live in the North are under explicit instructions by the South’s Sudan People’s Liberation Army to boycott the referendum, as the SPLA has grounds to believe that Bashir would use their registration to rig the results in favor of unity.
Some Arab leaders still toy with the idea that overthrowing him might yet salvage a united Sudan, but it is probably too late for that.
But, to avoid a cataclysm, the US and its allies must defuse the bomb by enforcing the provisions of the 2005 CPA, which they all endorsed.
Critics of the scheme view it as symptomatic of big government run amok and ask why it is necessary for any government to feed schoolchildren.
Today, 87% of government schools implement the scheme.
The national government provides funds for cooks and helpers, and has devised guidelines for the program’s implementation, but schools are under the jurisdiction of state governments, some of which are more capable than others of maintaining the standards required to provide a reliable service.
It should be emulated by other developing countries, not shunned because of a preventable disaster.
Gas provides a tempting form of leverage, and Russia had already used it against Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Moldova.
But, charges of corruption aside, this outcome indicates that gas is not such an easy source of hard economic power as it would first appear.
That will not be easy.
The lesson from the Ukraine episode is that while Russia is less of a gas superpower than it would appear, Europe would be wise for to start building greater diversity into the energy relationship.
After all, should the dollar depreciate, China does not want to have too many eggs in the US basket.
Even though almost all of the oil produced by Unocal would have ended up on world markets rather than back in China, the US Congress’s skittishness assured that Unocal was sold to homegrown Chevron.
Indeed, it is still unclear where China’s amazing evolution will ultimately lead, so it would be naïve for American leaders to assume that China’s intentions will always be friendly and constructive, or that the two countries are inevitably destined to grow closer.
That is a strategy that will leave the US and the EU weaker, not stronger.
China regards the SCO as a stage for broadening its influence over a vast region, ranging from the Asia-Pacific to Southwest Asia, the Middle East, East Africa, and the Indian Ocean.
Moreover, it continues to build its “ string of pearls” of military bases at every key point on maritime transportation routes along the “arc of instability” from the Middle East to China’s coast.
And China has publicly stated that it will back African nations in potential disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international organizations.
When the two countries upgraded their alliance relationship in 1996, Japan’s military operational sphere was expanded far from the Japanese main island.
Last year, Japan issued a visa to Taiwan’s former president, Lee Teng-hui, a man who explicitly advocates a US-Japan-Taiwan alliance against China.
So, barely two months into the second Bush administration, alarm bells about the China threat seem to be ringing again.
Moreover, the failure of developed countries – particularly, the US – to take responsibility for their historical emissions of greenhouse gases continues, representing a major sticking point because these emissions far surpass those of the developing world.
Both sides agree that their roles are critical.
It did sign the Kyoto agreement, albeit as an “Annex I state,” meaning that it did not commit to any defined limits on carbon emissions.
As a developing country that has throughout history emitted only one-fifth of the CO2 emitted by the US, China insists that it has the moral right to resist calls to take the lead.
Whether or not the housing correction will hit overall growth depends on how one defines “hit.”
But the central government must be responsible for inflation in times of overheating, lest a bursting bubble fuel unemployment.
So they invest and speculate fiercely without much consideration of risk.
But it seems that what they have been doing in practice happened to be better than what their counterparts in some other countries were doing – a lot on “de-regulation,” but too little on cooling things down when the economy was booming and bubbles were forming.
Further geo-political implications for the region and the world follow from three key changes in China.
And, when measured in terms of purchasing power parity, China’s GDP will reach that of the US around 2015, thus changing the world’s balance of economic power.
In Japan, postal services that had been privatized are to be re-nationalized, and the role of government finance is being strengthened.
The Chinese Road to Pyongyang
But, although North Korea’s latest economic travails have shaken the leadership, the regime has weathered worse. And the economic relationship between China and North Korea is driven as much by material interests and economic factors as it is by concerns over geopolitical stability.
The final misconception is that Hu might have demanded an explanation from Kim as to the causes of the fatal sinking of a South Korean vessel in late March.
COPENHAGEN – There is a dangerous misperception that willpower and political agreement are the only missing ingredients needed to combat global warming.
Use of fossil fuels – though much maligned by some – remains absolutely vital for economic development, prosperity, and our very survival.
The report concludes bluntly, “No Danish wind industry to speak of would exist if it had to compete on market terms.”
That is ten times more than is spent by governments now, but remains a fraction of the cost of the ineffective carbon cuts that have been proposed.
The science is clear, manmade changes in climate are being felt, and the electorate’s demand for action is growing. Though unlikely just a few months ago, a strong global agreement by 2010, one that will set a path for action for decades to come, now stands a good chance of being implemented.
This year, the IPCC is releasing its fourth round of reports, starting with the one issued early in February.
By the end of 2007, all of the world’s governments should begin negotiations on a climate-change system for the years after 2012, when the current Kyoto Protocol expires.
The Earth Institute at Columbia University, which I direct, hosted a Global Roundtable of leading businesses, environmental groups, and other international organizations to reach a consensus to help inform the upcoming negotiations. The Roundtable produced an important Statement of Principles and a longer overall statement that has been signed by many of the world’s largest businesses, including those based in the US, Europe, Canada, China, and India.
That anecdote has parallels with the current preoccupation with global warming.
Rich people rarely contract malaria or die from it; poor people do.
In Haiti, which lacks such policies, 2,000 died.
For one-fiftieth of that cost, we could provide essential micronutrients to 2-3 billion people, thereby preventing perhaps a million deaths and making half the world’s population mentally and physically much stronger.
For instance, changes are taking place in precipitation patterns, with a trend toward higher precipitation levels in the world’s upper latitudes and lower precipitation in some sub-tropical and tropical regions, as well as in the Mediterranean area.
Overall, temperature increases are projected to increase by the year 2100 within a range of 1.1 to 6.4˚C. In order to focus on this set of outcomes, the IPCC has come up with a best estimate at the lower end of this range of 1.8˚C, and 4˚C at the upper end.
Moreover, there are enormous co-benefits to mitigation: lower emissions of GHGs would be accompanied by lower air pollution and increased energy security, agricultural output, and employment. If these co-benefits were taken fully into account, that price tag of 3% of GDP in 2030 would be substantially lower, perhaps even negative.
Emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that accumulates in the atmosphere and is a major cause of rising temperatures, is a byproduct of a wide range of normal economic activities.
But such external shocks may also have indirect effects by aggravating the disparities between developed and developing countries and creating additional incentives for mass migration to rich, less affected, and more adaptable regions.
The so-called emissions trading system aims to control carbon emissions by allocating tradable permits.
Given that the bombs, bullets, and embargos of traditional security policy are irrelevant, what can the US and other rich countries do about this security threat? 
If the US turned inward and seriously curtailed immigration, there would be serious consequences for America’s position in the world.
Both the numbers and origins of the new immigrants have caused concerns about immigration’s effects on American culture.
The Census Bureau projects that the American population will grow 49% over the next four decades.
In addition, the presence of multiple cultures creates avenues of connection with other countries, and helps create an important broadening of American attitudes in an era of globalization.
Enlightened Japanese elites are fascinated by Franco-German reconciliation.
Moreover, Europeans should, in the same spirit of openness, ask themselves what they can learn from Asia.
Many Chinese may dream of spending like Europeans, but the nightmare of most Europeans nowadays is that they might have to start working as hard as the Chinese.
Moreover, Europe’s ability to exert pressure on China is extremely limited at best, and may be least potent where Chinese domestic matters are concerned.
The main result of monetary stimulus has been to boost asset prices: anything that pays a yield, a dividend, or a rent becomes much more attractive - and hence much more valuable in money terms - when interest rates are very low and expected to stay very low.
The dominant mode of thought within the Federal Reserve - with which I agree - appears to be that the information-technology revolution is continuing, that the pace of growth of potential output in the US remains very fast, and that the output gap is thus relatively wide.
This is a crucial question for policy makers, because those who bought long-term assets due to what seemed like perpetually rising prices are also those who will sell as soon as price trends seem to be reversing.
The report was drawn up by experts from almost all OAS member states, and was divided into two parts: an excellent analytical section, and a brief and somewhat exasperating chapter devoted to future scenarios.
The third “marijuana moment” stems from recent decisions in New York and Illinois – the third and fifth most populous US states, respectively – to proceed with legalizing medical marijuana.
International conventions still limit governments’ leeway, and the US government remains opposed to any backtracking from the punitive, prohibitionist strategy that it has pursued since 1981.
In 1999, The Economist labeled Germany “the sick man of the euro” – a monument of European sclerosis, with low growth and high unemployment.
One of his first decisions was to peg the Danish krone to the Deutschmark to stop the inflation-devaluation cycle.
The Social Democrats returned to power in 1994, but they accepted Bildt’s new fiscal policies, and even carried out a revolutionary pension reform in 1998 that properly tied benefits to payments.
Since 1992, it has maintained a more or less balanced budget, with hardly any public debt.
Third, reforms require a strong leader.
The Soviet Union’s collapse, it should be remembered, was not the result of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev’s reformist “betrayal.”
The third stage extends the myth through heroic triumph.
The coming transition will be markedly different from the 1999 transfer of power.
They now argue that Putin personally chose repression in responding to the protest movement that filled the streets of Moscow and other major cities in late 2011 and early 2012.
As his opponents have hardened their stance, Russia has become ripe for a peaceful anti-criminal revolution.
The supply stand-off between Russia and Ukraine of 2009 made these worries crystal clear in Europe, where gas imports are set to rise to 86% of demand by 2030, from 57% in 2006.
The energy sector has a relatively slow rate of capital replacement because of the long lifetimes of much of its infrastructure.
To do so would mean a technology shift that – in terms of scale and speed of deployment – is unprecedented.
But clear price signals are not enough, as a low-carbon future requires major breakthroughs in technology development and deployment.
Some conservatives disliked the crude egalitarianism of American culture, while some on the left saw America’s faith in markets as a symbol of capitalist exploitation of the working class.
According to Sarkozy, “The virulence of the press and a portion of French elites against the United States reflects a certain envy of your brilliant success.”
But one should not read too much into these differences.
FLORENCE – US President Barack Obama’s administration has lost little time in announcing that it will seek direct talks with the Iranian government.
Yet each of the region’s states has important security concerns and vulnerabilities.
This is true, but it is an insufficient explanation.
Under ideal diplomatic circumstances, Russia and China would be persuaded to join with NATO in a joint declaration.
Deflecting mounting criticism, Bush rejects appeals to boycott the summit.
Russia has stabilized under Putin, but its has become markedly less democratic.
But there need to be limits to the West’s tolerance, particularly given the summit’s agenda, which features energy security, fighting disease, promoting education, counter-terrorism, and non-proliferation.
On terrorism, Russia was the first country to host an official Hamas delegation after the Palestinian elections, and it continues to crush Chechen terror and resistance with methods that would bring it to an international court, were it not a Security Council member.
Chancellor Angela Merkel is celebrating a landslide victory, with her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) having fallen just short of an outright parliamentary majority.
Merkel’s predecessor, the Social Democratic Party (SPD) leader Gerhard Schröder, knew this well.
So Germany will be left with a grand coalition – just as the German electorate wanted.
Her positions on these issues have now been endorsed by a huge portion of the German electorate; and, from a certain age, most people – including those in high office – do not change easily.
The Human Stew
But new evidence suggests that modern humans evolved relatively recently in Africa – and that the transformation that they underwent after their departure some 60,000 years ago was far from seamless.
As a result, many people’s genomes contain roughly 1% Neanderthal DNA.
In this case, the source may have been as-yet-unknown remnants of the ancient species Homo heidelbergensis – a direct ancestor of both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis – surviving somewhere in southern Africa.
The overwhelming consensus in the policy community is that if only the government had bailed out Lehman, the whole thing would have been a hiccup and not a heart attack.&nbsp; Famous investors and leading policymakers alike have opined that in our ultra-interconnected global economy, a big financial institution like Lehman can never be allowed to fail.
The system had reached a point where it had to be bailed out and restructured.&nbsp; And there is no realistic political or legal scenario where such a bailout could have been executed without some blood on the streets.&nbsp; Hence, the fall of a large bank or investment bank was inevitable as a catalyst to action.
Asia may be willing to sponsor the west for now, but not in perpetuity.&nbsp; Eventually Asia will find alternatives in part by deepening its own debt markets.&nbsp; Within a few years, western governments will have to sharply raise taxes, inflate, partially default, or some combination of all three.&nbsp; As painful as it may seem, it would be far better to start bringing fundamentals in line now.&nbsp; Restoring confidence has been helpful and important.
Consider, for example, America in Iraq.
Daily violence should not be allowed to hide deeper strategic realities: victory was around the corner, and soon, the world – despite all the anti-Bush propaganda – would recognize it.
Of course, confidence and self-doubt are not mutually exclusive.
Only the self-correcting mechanisms of truly democratic regimes can ensure the right balance.
In mid-July 2011, Greece’s sovereign debt stood at €350 billion (160% of GDP).
It was write-offs and devaluations, not austerity programs, that allowed bond prices to recover.
But, until 1980, Germany continued repaying the loans that it had incurred to pay the reparations.
This raises the question of justice, but not the economic consequences of insisting on payment.
But other countries – including neighboring Asian economies – fear that Japan is devaluing the yen to bolster exports and growth at their expense.
The collapse of asset bubbles in the 1990’s left Japan’s financial system and private sector saddled with a huge debt overhang.
The danger of a currency war and protectionism should not be underestimated.
East Asian economies could then, over time, cooperate to enhance regional exchange-rate stability, thereby creating a more conducive environment for intra-regional trade.
As a Korean, I am always puzzled by Korean extremism. Where in the world can you find a more isolated, regimented and militarized dynastic mutation of a communist totalitarian system than in North Korea?
“Economic strangulation” of North Korea appears to be the fallback option.
After tough and effective UN-led sanctions are imposed, the concerned parties must wait until North Korea feels the pain of the economic squeeze.
That failure led directly to the colonization of Korea by Japan.
Russia and Iran have kept the Syrian government supplied with heavy weapons and other military assistance, including a Russian shipment of sophisticated anti-ship missiles with advanced radar systems.
Part of Syria’s agony is the self-fulfilling nature of the conflict.
In a recent conversation about Syria with a couple of well-known foreign policy experts, one participant suggested that the Middle East’s current borders, drawn in colonial times, cannot last and must be redrawn.
But if the lessons of the past two years are any guide, the wheels of violence will keep on turning.
But enlargement fatigue among the member states continues to muddy this optimistic forecast.
But that has changed fundamentally.
Indeed, unlike in previous accession rounds, the EU has provided no concrete timetable for achieving the promise of membership made in Thessaloniki ten years ago.
It is to be ratified by national parliaments, in some cases through referenda, and it can be amended only by further Inter-Governmental Conferences, not by the European Parliament, let alone by the (non-existent) "people of Europe."
This is why it has the curious quality that sometimes you see it and sometimes you don't.
All this suggests conclusions that give pause for thought.
There are major unresolved issues in the "near-abroad" of the enlarged Union, in Eastern Europe, and in the Balkans.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, the French Emperor Napoleon III actually created a Latin Monetary Union, which included Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland.
Voting budgets in parliament – a representative institution – ensured that the people as a whole were liable for the obligations incurred by their government. They would thus have a powerful incentive to impose controls on spending to insure that their claims could be met.
But there was an immediate problem: the existing tax system had reached its limits, and no more revenue could be raised without ending time-honored privileges and immunities.
John Kerry’s Tricky Bid
But, with the security situation in the “occupied territories” under control, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s government is content with the status quo.
By revisiting the Israeli offer, Kerry could neatly combine economic stimulus with fulfillment of a key Palestinian demand.
“How do we resolve the contradiction between our extreme morality and our blatantly immoral circumstances?” asks the writer Uri Avnery.
After all, ordinary soldiers take this risk, so why should political leaders – who can do much greater good or ill – be immune to it?
Syria’s Hijacked Struggle
Jihadi fighters connected to Al Qaeda are now in the majority.
Salim Idris, the council’s chief of staff, has expressed a willingness to fight alongside extremist groups that refuse to accept the unified command.
They disregard the warnings of people like Alain Chouet, the former chief officer of the French General Directorate for External Security in Damascus, who recently denounced France’s provision of weapons to the rebels as “completely illegal” and described how “the jihadi militias have taken precedence over the others.”
Some leaders may be starting to recognize the need for a new narrative.
When they arrived, brown domes made of crisscrossed branches and layers of multicolored mats would appear like crowds of dappled beetles on the outskirts of town.
Today, there are some 50 million nomadic herders in Sub-Saharan Africa, and as many as 150 million agro-pastoralists, who combine traditional nomadic animal-rearing with some form of agriculture.
In order to enhance their livelihoods’ stability and profitability further, pastoralists need to be integrated into the formal economy.
Cooperative movements took shape in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Japan in the 1800’s.
Of course, cooperatives have sometimes struggled to live up to the ideal.
Some of the most notable programs include the Indian Dairy Cooperative, which has created an estimated 250,000 jobs, mostly in rural areas.
COPENHAGEN – A sense of panic is setting in among many campaigners for drastic cuts in global carbon emissions.
In Kyoto, leaders committed to a cut of 5.2% below 1990 levels by 2010.
This finding was based on a groundbreaking research paper that showed that even a highly efficient global CO2 tax aimed at fulfilling the ambitious goal of keeping temperature increases below 2oC would reduce annual world GDP by a staggering 12.9%, or $40 trillion, in 2100.
If politicians change course and agree this December to invest significantly more in research and development, we would have a much greater chance of getting this technology to the level where it needs to be.
In a world of mobile capital, corporate-tax rates matter, and business decisions about how and where to invest are increasingly sensitive to national differences.
It would also reduce numerous efficiency-reducing distortions in the US tax code, including substantial tax advantages for debt financing over equity financing and for non-corporate businesses over corporate businesses.
Eliminating accelerated depreciation for equipment would raise the effective tax rate on new investments; repealing the domestic-production deduction would increase the effective tax rate on US manufacturing; and rescinding the R&amp;D tax credit would reduce investment in innovation.
An increase in the corporate-tax rate appeals to many US voters who believe that corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes and are worried about widening income inequality.
The US government is thus essentially being paid in real terms to take investors’ money – a generous offer that it is accepting on a huge scale, in the hope that channeling these resources to American consumers will boost household spending and thus generate more jobs.
So why is the US now singing a different tune? The answer is obvious: America’s high unemployment rate, which hovers between 9% and 10%.
Such a move is likely to be effective, given the sheer size of Chinese interventions (hundreds of billions of US dollars annually), which could not easily be recycled through offshore banks without exposing the China’s central bank to many other risks.
Count to ten before you respond.
The good news about the Bush project, so far title-free, is that it is apparently going to be different from the usual reputation polishing.
This is where Cheney came in.
Cheney’s influence resulted in the bloody disaster of Iraq, the moral humiliation of Guantanamo, water-boarding and “extraordinary rendition,” the despair of friends and the contempt of critics, a full-dress parade of double standards around the globe.
NEW YORK – China’s successful transformation from a middle-income country to a modern, high-income country will depend largely on the reforms that the government undertakes over the next decade.
Developing-country central banks keep interest rates artificially low to ensure sufficient low-cost financing for the public sector, while avoiding large fiscal deficits and high inflation.
SMEs and households with net savings stand to gain the most from interest-rate liberalization.
Gradual implementation would enable the losers to adjust their behavior before it is too late, while sustaining momentum on pivotal reforms, which should be policymakers’ top priority.
Cameron, of course, faced a difficult task with his party, which required a statement from him of his European policy.
Already some are claiming to discern in his European policy the makings of an heir to Harold Wilson, another famous “renegotiator” of Britain’s terms of membership in the then-European Community who went on to win a referendum on Europe.
Given that this position reflects the British public’s attitude toward the EU, it is not surprising.
The net result is that it seems highly probable that any attempted achievement of a “new settlement,” including repatriation of competences, will make it much more difficult for Britain to remain in the EU than would be the case if a straightforward “in/out” referendum were held now.
Yet, despite the cost in human lives, anti-GM campaigners – from Greenpeace to Naomi Klein – have derided efforts to use golden rice to avoid vitamin A deficiency.
Both are great deals. But golden rice would cost just $100 for every life saved from vitamin A deficiency.
Foodstuffs like soy, wheat, milk, eggs, mollusks, crustaceans, fish, sesame, nuts, peanuts, and kiwi would likewise be banned, because they can cause food allergies.
Yes, the seeds are more expensive, but the rise in production offsets the additional cost.
The Obama of the Cairo speech of 2009, when he called for a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world, has been increasingly eclipsed by Obama the terrorist-slayer, the commander-in-chief who has launched hundreds of drone strikes against Al Qaeda and its affiliates and who ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden.
That would mean bombing Damascus, which could harden Syrian support for Assad.
Consider the contrast with Libya, where one of the outcomes of US intervention was tens of thousands of Libyans marching in the streets with placards declaring their support of the US and their outrage and sorrow at the murder of the US ambassador.
The Cracks in the G-20
The premise is clear: as the crisis made more evident than ever, the interdependence of countries is inescapable.
Even respecting the idiosyncrasies of each context, there is still sufficient common ground for more precision in the agreements.
Lack of agreement on the United Nations Security Council resolution against Iran does not help coordination and cooperation within the G-20, either.
So there remains much to do.
Moreover, failed states are an incubator for terrorism, trafficking of drugs and people, piracy, and other illicit activities. Of the half that remains at peace, the large majority end up highly dependent on foreign aid – hardly a sustainable model in the context of the global financial crisis.
As a result, such policies should be discontinued as soon as possible.
The rest was allocated to the US Department of Defense as a supplement to its annual budget, which has been between $500 and $650 billion in recent years.
On July 13, 1931, the German banking system collapsed, ensuring that what was previously an American economic downturn became the worldwide Great Depression.
In each of these summer crises, addressing the technical issue was not enough to solve the problem.
A Europeanization of some part of value-added tax would be a tremendous advance in combating the massive fraud that the existing system nurtures.
Consider the European crises that produced good outcomes.
He realized that it was important to act early, with money that would be spent quickly, but that there was a risk that the crisis would not be over soon.
Deficit fetishism never makes sense –&#160;the national debt is only one side of a country’s balance sheet.
There is no reason that mining companies should reap this reward for themselves.
Rudd campaigned on a promise to reverse that stance, but the failure of the climate-change talks in Copenhagen last December, when President Barack Obama refused to make the kind of commitment on behalf of the United States that was required, left Rudd’s government in an awkward position.
The Crisis of Consumerism
Consumption or, more precisely, consumerism , appeared to be globalized.
But schemes such as public subsidies for scrapping old and fuel-inefficient cars simply led many people to re-schedule their purchases.
The Great Depression of the 1930’s was interpreted as the result of inadequate consumption, of poverty in the midst of plenty.
What will replace the age of consumerism? The most obvious answer is that the shift to a service economy – already well under way by the beginning of the new millennium – will become more complete.
This service economy may generate higher levels of overall well-being if it emphasizes that humans do not exist as separate islands, but existentially depend on their relations with others.
As sensible as this two-pronged approach – spend now, cut later – may be, it is made virtually impossible by the absence of any mechanism whereby President Barack Obama can credibly commit himself or future administrations to fiscal tightening.
But, once again, this requires a credible commitment to an exchange that requires a promise of action later in return for something now.
But certain fiscal decisions, and most critically the level of the fiscal deficit, can be delegated to an independent board.
But possibilities are shaped by our decisions as much as they are by our circumstances.
Aggressive agents were marketing the loans with no heed to borrowers’ capacity to repay.
The late Indian management guru C.K. Prahalad suggested in his bestselling book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid that businesses could make healthy profits by serving the poor – and so satisfy their shareholders while promoting social development.
Private institutions obviously cannot afford to do that.
One year after he was re-elected in a landslide, Thailand’s Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been forced to dissolve the National Assembly and call a snap election.
In foreign affairs, Thaksin carved out his own space on the international stage with ambitious regional cooperation schemes anchored around the 25-member Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation (ACMECS) and a clutch of bilateral free-trade agreements with the major powers, including the US, China, Japan, India, and Australia.
Thaksin’s days appear numbered, for Thailand seems poised to eject a popularly elected prime minister.
Moreover, a royal intervention would risk returning Thailand to square one, seeking to rewrite its constitution to remedy the shortfalls of its democratic culture.
To public opinion, it looks as if arrogant financial-market professionals learned nothing from the crisis, feeding the impression that nothing has changed – except for the worse.
The G-20’s Washington program (signed by George W. Bush) was neither ambitious nor well structured.
The era when London vaunted its light-touch regulation is over.
Financial reform could still go belly up. But it is premature to write it off as a failure.
After 70 years of denial, Russia’s leadership (if not yet ordinary Russians) were ready to admit that Joseph Stalin’s NKVD (precursor to the KGB) slaughtered more than 20,000 Polish officers, intellectuals, and clergy in the nearby Katyn forest in 1940.
Throughout the interwar years, Poland and the nascent Soviet regime were at daggers drawn almost without interruption.
The Polish-born Pope John Paul II crystallized the anti-communist “threat” that Poland now posed to the Soviet Union.
For example, pre-modern Europe believed that a woman who had sex before marriage might carry the imprint of her lover within her, so that her child born in wedlock would resemble the earlier lover, rather than the husband.
But the emergence of molecular comparisons in the 1960’s, and DNA technologies in the 1980’s, presented a new way of comparing species.
We can gain some zoological perspective on what that number really means by comparing another species to apes and humans.
That is not to say it is inaccurate or false; just that its meaning is far less obvious than it may appear superficially. &nbsp;
In the future, Cameron declared, Muslim groups that do not, for example, endorse women’s rights, defend freedom of expression, or promote integration would lose all government funding.
The Stockholm suicide bombing was not the first act of violence linked to Vilks.
The Sweden Democrats (SD), a party with roots in the country’s white-supremacist movement, entered the parliament for the first time in September 2010, with the support of 5.7% of the Swedish electorate.
But China’s rulers permit discussion of the Cultural Revolution only within this official framework, suppressing any and all unofficial reflections.
The revolution’s veterans refuse to discuss their arrogant presumption of “natural Redness,” or to mention that they rebelled because they wanted power.
She complained that she was “too famous,” “too active,” and “too stressed” at the time, and she provided extensive details about how Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, persecuted the Ye family and how the Ye children went to prison.
As long as the Cultural Revolution remains unaccounted for, it will not have ended.
People in the Ukrainian town of Kherson are more entrepreneurial than people from Kiev.
Cultural variables seem to explain a lot: religion and politics accounted for about half of the variation across municipalities.
She interviewed people in both countries and asked them what it meant to be a “worthy person.” In essence, she was asking people about their sense of what is important in life and about their own personal sense of identity.
Virtually every country is a pastiche of local cultures that differ in how they motivate people and shape their personal identity.
For only the US – with all its power and sense of mission – had the ability to establish a new world order at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
This was not always and everywhere the case – certainly not in Latin America.
What is needed is a conscious, deliberate return of US foreign policy to multilateralism.
She was right then, and she is still right today.
FLORENCE – The nineteenth century was mesmerized by the cyclical behavior of business.
Keynesianism definitively ended in 1979, following the second oil-price shock of the decade.
The response to the economic crisis in Thailand and Korea in the late 1990’s was emphatic preaching about the inherent superiority of the so-called Anglo-Saxon economic model.
The European social-democratic model survived the 1970’s in a bedraggled form.
So there is no master currency at all any more.
But the rescue has fueled a growing rift that jeopardizes the future of European integration, partly owing to the way that the upheaval of the early twentieth century – especially the Great Depression – has been reenacted in the debates about the post-2008 financial meltdown and the subsequent euro crisis.
Events in Cyprus have exposed two other dimensions to the clashes over Europe’s dual sovereign-debt and banking crisis.
Even the Catholic Church seems to reflect the new mood: The election of Jorge Mario Bergoglio as Pope Francis is a clear reference to St. Francis of Assisi and the Church’s mission to stand up for the poor.
CANBERRA – North Korea’s latest nuclear test is bad news, both for Northeast Asia and for a world that needs to reduce its reliance on nuclear weapons.
Nor has North Korea’s behavior done anything to help the cause of global non-proliferation and disarmament.
For that message to resonate, the major nuclear-armed states must not only remain committed to non-proliferation, but also get serious about disarmament.
But they don’t bear all the blame for the past, and are not behaving completely irrationally.
Importantly, adverse effects are seen at very low intakes: for example, 1-3% of total energy, or approximately 2-7 grams (20-60 calories) for a person consuming 2000 calories/day.
4. Use of trans fats in food manufacturing and restaurants can be limited without any significant effects on food taste, cost, or availability. While industry often expresses concern that limiting the use of trans fats will affect food taste or cost, no evidence exists to support this hypothesis.
The formal name of the panel was “Silicon Envy: Will Europe ever build the next new media giant?”
All over the world, little boys study math and science in the hope of becoming the next Bill Gates.
But the two CEOs couldn’t agree on terms, and now the CTO’s company is dead while the other company struggles with inadequate technology.
The problem is not just a lack of engineers, but also of people with the necessary business, financial, and communication skills.
The Dangers of Deficit Reduction
Faster growth and returns on public investment yield higher tax revenues, and a 5 to 6% return is more than enough to offset temporary increases in the national debt.
Yet, even with large deficits, economic growth in the US and Europe is anemic, and forecasts of private-sector growth suggest that in the absence of continued government support, there is risk of continued stagnation – of growth too weak to return unemployment to normal levels anytime soon.
Principles like “it is better to tax bad things than good things” might suggest imposing environmental taxes.
For now, the economics is clear: reducing government spending is a risk not worth taking.
But debates about the role of nuclear weapons in the modern world, as well as in the future, are only beginning.
Nuclear deterrence – a threat to kill hundreds of thousands or millions of people – is a concept that does not fit into traditional morals.
Similarly, if the US withdraws its largely nominal tactical nuclear weapons from Europe, US-Europe strategic ties would weaken.
Arms-control talks are mostly needed for rendering national arsenals more transparent, and for building confidence between the great powers.
After two rounds of quantitative easing (QE), the balance sheets of the European Central Bank and the United States Federal Reserve have grown to €3.2 trillion ($4.1 trillion) and $2.9 trillion, respectively.
Given that the renminbi’s real and expected rates of return are higher than the real rate of return of other currencies, it has become a positive carry against foreign currencies, reinforcing the tendency to hold assets in renminbi and liabilities in foreign currencies.
These events are not distant memories.
Financial globalization meant that banks no longer held assets like mortgages on their books, but packaged them in asset-backed securities that were sold to investors in capital markets worldwide, thereby distributing risk more widely.
Finally, the investors who bought MBS’s and CDO’s were greedy and believed the misleading ratings.
Easier monetary policy may boost liquidity, but it will not resolve the solvency crisis.
Fourth, the role of rating agencies needs to be rethought, with more regulation and competition introduced.
For example, the countries that were consigned by Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin’s un-tender mercies are now mostly part of the European Union.
Many Chagossians eventually moved away from the Seychelles and Mauritius. Some settled in London (my European Parliament constituency).
But, when answering a parliamentary question that I put to the European Commission recently, the commissioner responsible for development policy, Andris Piebalgs, indicated that the Commission would consider any request from the UK for co-financing the Chagossians’ repatriation, which the EU fully and rightly accepts as a sovereign UK matter.
Unlike many other African states, Somalis had roughly the same linguistic and ethnic background.
Protestants replied that if a vote were held within the geographical area of the entire island, the two-thirds Catholic majority would rule.
In the Caucasus, Azerbeijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Abkhazians, and Chechens all demanded states on the basis of self-determination.
The best hope for the future is to ask what is being determined as well as who determines it.
Rajaratnam’s trial is remarkable in many ways.
Past insider-trading prosecutions of people other than occasional traders usually involved rogue financiers, like Ivan Boesky in the 1980’s.
Fortunately, this is not the case.
Investors are talking of “green shoots” of recovery and of positive “second derivatives of economic activity” (continuing economic contraction is the first, negative, derivative, but the slower rate suggests that the bottom is near).
It is said that the International Monetary Fund, which earlier this year revised upward its estimate of bank losses, from $1 trillion to $2.2 trillion, will announce a new estimate of $3.1 trillion for US assets and $0.9 trillion for foreign assets, figures very close to my own.
At some point, investors will realize that bank losses are massive, and that some banks are insolvent.
The Dear Leader Cleans House for the Young General
In particular, they have been monitoring the body count of senior North Korean officials who have suddenly retired, disappeared, or died in automobile accidents.
Indeed, China offered South Korea a veiled warning that it “should not sweat the small stuff,” implying that the unprovoked killing of 46 South Korean sailors is a petty matter, and certainly not one that will cause China to rethink its alliance with North Korea.
All this diplomatic activity is good news for everyone, everywhere. But neither the US-Russia agreement, nor the global nuclear arms talks, will have much impact on today’s most perilous threat: the nuclear honeymoon between an Iran determined to acquire a nuclear weapons capacity and a North Korea willing to sell Iran much of that capacity for hard currency.
Those seen as having failed to follow Party dictates in an appropriate way face severe recrimination.
This is how it works: the Second Economic Committee, which is under the command of the Party’s central leadership, manufactures missiles with the help of North Korea’s Second Academy of Natural Sciences.
So desperate is North Korea’s financial position that, this past December, the Ministry of People’s Security suspended the domestic use of foreign currency. Violations are punishable by death.
One sensational if undocumented story has the Gulf States conspiring with China, Russia, Japan, and France – now there’s an odd coalition for you – to shift the pricing of oil away from dollars.
When the sub-prime crisis erupted in early September 2007, I published an article entitled “Why Now is a Good Time to Sell the Dollar” in a prominent financial publication.
Their intervention in recent weeks shows a reluctance to let this happen.
And, even then, the renminbi will presumably share the international stage with the dollar, not replace it.
Foreigners – and residents – might well grow disenchanted with the currency of an economy with these characteristics.
Although the French-speaking Belgians started the European Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, they are now living in a deprived rustbelt in need of federal subsidies, a substantial amount of which comes from taxes paid by the more prosperous, high-tech Flemish.
Belgian separatists like to observe that Belgium was never a natural nation-state, but an accident of history.
One reason why Flemish Belgians resent having to prop up the Walloons with their tax money is that they regard them almost as foreigners.
If Flemish citizens don’t want their taxes to go to the Walloons, what about helping out unemployed immigrants from Africa, a large chunk of which the Belgians once owned and exploited as a major source of their prosperity? It should come as no surprise that the Flemish nationalist party (Vlaams Belang) is hostile to immigrants too.
Without having intended it, the EU now seems to be encouraging the very forces that postwar European unity was designed to contain.
Even the conservative states of the Arabian Peninsula are embroiled in lively disputes about women ministers, Shia representation, Islamist participation in the political process, and even the future of their ruling monarchies.
Indeed, Prince Naif, the Minister of the Interior and leader of the hardliners, has either silenced or imprisoned hundreds of the key Saudi reformers.
All await a chance to rule.
Death, of course, comes to all living things.
But NATO’s repeated demonstrations of resilience should not blind us to the fact that it no longer provides a healthy basis for the transatlantic security relationship.
All the talk of an improved NATO-European Union partnership is mainly wasted breath.
The US mission to the EU should be scaled up, and EU representation in Washington turned into a proper embassy. The more seriously the Americans show that they are willing to take the EU collectively, the more seriously the Europeans will take themselves.
Will it survive the current maelstrom of challenges – exemplified by the recent assassination of Governor Salmaan Taseer of Punjab by one of his bodyguards, an Islamic zealot – or will it capsize? For the world, Pakistan’s fate is an urgent, perhaps even an existential, question.
This brings us to the heart of the matter: the question of Islam and statehood.
Indeed, the issue that now lies at Pakistan’s core is whether it can become a theocratic state.
In Pakistan, the extremist now wears Islamic garb, and stands for the Creator, for faith, and for a theocratic order.
He was a world-renowned philosopher, a professor at great universities – Oxford, Yale, Chicago – and someone who was respected and admired by his colleagues around the world.
But while Kolakowski “traveled” with the Communists and supported them for a few years, he was never really a “good comrade” because he never allowed himself to stop thinking for himself.
He was an icon among his fellow countrymen – indeed, for his 70th birthday, the largest newspaper in Poland organized a celebration during which they crowned him (with a crown of laurel leaves, of course) … the King of Europe.
It was an implicit wish for a spectacular form of suicide, for a spectacularly prosaic reason: the loss, experienced by thousands of Russian women of her generation, of her life’s existential foundation.
Along with its restraints on liberty and its dramatic increase in the power of the Kremlin bureaucracy, Putin has overseen the rise of a Russian middle class that has become increasingly similar to Western middle classes.
But for Tereshkova and other women of her generation, the great Soviet state and the daring achievements of Soviet science were inseparable.
Although economic globalization has enabled unprecedented levels of prosperity in advanced countries and has been a boon to hundreds of millions of poor workers in China and elsewhere in Asia, it rests on shaky pillars. Unlike national markets, which tend to be supported by domestic regulatory and political institutions, global markets are only “weakly embedded.”
Meanwhile, they regarded themselves as the true progressives, because they understood that safeguarding and advancing globalization was the best remedy against poverty and insecurity.   
What they want is not to turn back globalization, but to create new institutions and compensation mechanisms – at home or internationally – that will render globalization more effective, fairer, and more sustainable.
The world economy desperately awaits its new Keynes.
Money ceases to have credibility. Leaders become figures of contempt or worse.
Its fraudulent accounts were certified by Arthur Andersen.
Rubin, a former US Treasury Secretary and ex-Chairman of Goldman Sachs, presided over the collapse of Citigroup while taking home $150 million in bonuses.
These Wall Street princes were smarter in one way, however: they managed to pocket a fortune while the rest of us are stuck with the mess they left behind.
These are economies that, even a decade ago, were losing market share to China and Asia, owing to their labor-intensive and low value-added exports.
Default and an exit from the euro would occur well before that.
Greece is currently too interconnected to be allowed to collapse: since it has about $400 billion of public debt – three-quarters of which is held abroad, mostly by European financial institutions – a disorderly default would lead to massive losses and risk a systemic crisis.
For now, the official community has decided to stick with Plan A; if that fails, Plan B is default to reduce unsustainable debts and a Greek exit from the eurozone to allow depreciation and restoration of competitiveness and growth.
It is not clear that other countries have the will or capacity to develop alternative engines of growth.
That encouraged investment spending, which in turn drove productivity gains and output growth.
Wages have stagnated despite strong productivity growth, while the trade deficit has set new records.
In this way, the Fed contributed to creating the sub-prime crisis.
But the eurozone’s leaders have not heeded their advice – and the consequences are becoming increasingly apparent.
The mistrust and fear that this elicits in the bond markets can lead to liquidity crises that, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, drive countries closer to default.
To overcome these obstacles, a eurozone debt-mutualization scheme must satisfy three crucial requirements.
In fact, Alexander Hamilton adopted this approach more than 200 years ago, when he decided to mutualize the debts that individual US states had incurred during the Revolutionary War – a decisive move toward further political integration.
Recent World Bank poverty recalculations are expected to raise the number even higher.
Many service-sector jobs are low-paying, precarious, and not covered by formal mechanisms of social protection.
Decent work also implies equality of opportunity and treatment as well as good prospects for both personal development and social inclusion.
In these circumstances, many are predicting America’s decline, especially relative to China.
Now it is the Chinese.
As for absolute decline, the US has very real problems, but the American economy remains highly productive. America remains first in total R&amp;D expenditure, first in university rankings, first in Nobel prizes, and first on indices of entrepreneurship.
Many commentators worry about America’s inefficient political system.
If so, the gloomy predictions of absolute American decline will turn out to be as misleading as similar predictions in decades past.
These decisions have become more alarming over time as the need for “more Europe” has become progressively more obvious.
But now even that is coming into question, thanks to Germany.
In opposition to almost every eurozone foreign minister or president, the chairman of Ecofin, and the European Central Bank’s president, Germany insisted that the International Monetary Fund be brought to the rescue of Greece, a brute denial of the principle of solidarity behind the euro.
It can still be avoided, but only if all Europeans remember their solidarity and act with unusual courage and tenacity.
Steps like these may have been overlooked in better economic times.
Moreover, conservatives who had aligned themselves with Ahmedinejad are now criticizing him openly.
Ahmedinejad may be making increasingly challenging statements, but he does not have the authority to act on them.
A long-sought peace agreement was secured for the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
For the Long Peace, the most intriguing explanation – and, I think, the most persuasive, though many may disagree – is that since the end of World War II, a fundamental normative shift has occurred among the major powers’ policymakers.
For optimists, what matters is believing in and nurturing the instinct of cooperation in the hope, and expectation, that decent human values will ultimately prevail.
Customers often value a good more when its price goes up.
Economic institutions can have different effects, depending on their quality.
Moreover, what seem like obvious, commonsense policy solutions all too often have unintended consequences, because a policy’s targets are not passive objects, as in physics, but active agents who react in unpredictable ways.
And it discourages younger, less credentialed economists from entering the public discourse.
Perhaps respectful debate in economics is possible only in academia.
EMR usage in America, the home of Apple and Google, stands at only 69%.
Within minutes, a seven year old can teach herself to play a complex game on an iPad.
The US government is trying to help.
The payoff will be worth it.
But the focus on agriculture diverted attention from a far broader agenda that could have been pursued in ways that would have benefited both North and the South.
Evidently, the Bush administration would rather help Middle East oil producers, whose interests so often seem at variance with those of the US, than Brazil.
As a result, much of the developing world is relieved that at least this risk has been avoided.
PARIS – Elections stolen in Iran, disputed in Afghanistan, and caricatured in Gabon: recent ballots in these and many other countries do not so much mark the global advance of democracy as demonstrate the absence of the rule of law.
Today’s despots view near-unanimous Soviet-style electoral “victories” as vulgar and old fashioned.
It is impossible to say to Afghanistan, for example, “You have deeply disappointed us, so, from now on, you must clean up your own mess.”
It is the West’s acceptance of corruption – either open or tacit – that makes it an accomplice to too many nefarious regimes, and makes its espousal of democratic principles appear either hypocritical or contradictory.
Sectarian conflict seems to be increasing on a daily basis, with militias massacring hundreds of Sunnis and Shiites solely on the basis of their religious identities.
Similarly, the survey found declining support for an Islamic state.
Curiously, in Tehran, Iran, the choice is markedly in favor of Iranian, rather than Muslim, identity.
So it appears that Iraqis are showing greater attachment to their national identity and are supportive of a non-sectarian approach to government.
Why, then, has India’s GDP growth slowed so much, from nearly 10% year on year in 2010-11 to 5% today? Was annual growth of almost 8% in the decade from 2002 to 2012 an aberration?
A similar story played out elsewhere.
To offset the collapse in demand from industrial countries, they had stimulated domestic demand.
By bringing together the key ministers, the committee has coordinated and accelerated decision-making, and has already approved tens of billions of dollars in spending in its first few meetings.
The project includes nine large industrial zones, high-speed freight lines, three ports, six airports, a six-lane expressway, and a 4,000-megawatt power plant.
Africa’s silent tsunami of malaria, however, is actually largely avoidable and controllable.
Poor countries cannot afford these investments on their own, so rich countries must help.
Malaria is an important example where specific investments can solve the problems of disease, hunger, and extreme poverty.
Moreover, with the “democratization” of aid now underway, we can look forward to increased private efforts alongside official development assistance.
Of course, governments need to run deficits in depressions in order to stimulate demand and stem rising unemployment.
A few have done so because they are making careers as party-line Republicans, so their priority is to tell Republican politicians what they want to hear (Josh Bolton and Mitch Daniels come to mind here).
But what is the right fiscal policy for a future Democratic administration to follow when there is no guarantee that any Republican successors will ever be “normal” again? That’s a hard question, and I don’t know the answer.
While the transformation may not always be seamless, there is no longer room to doubt that an Asian century is on the horizon, and that the world’s chemistry will change fundamentally.
Honest discussion of unpopular ideas is a key feature of an open society.
With 3% of the world’s population, the US can no longer dominate the rest of the world, because Asians, with 60% of the world’s population, are no longer underperforming.
In order to be prepared for the transformation, Americans must abandon ingrained ideas and old assumptions, and liberate unthinkable thoughts.
Indeed, today the market for derivatives is oligopolistic, with a few banks running huge profit margins.
To fix this problem, we need to move the bulk of derivative trading onto organized exchanges, where daily collateral requirements would guarantee systemic stability, and price transparency would force competition, reduce margins, and increase the market’s depth.
The United States currently spends $147 billion on obesity-related health care annually.
That is how human bodies are designed to metabolize food.
The liver mitochondria could not keep up with the energy onslaught, and had no choice but to employ a little-used escape valve called “de novo lipogenesis” (new fat-making) to turn excess energy substrate into liver fat.
Prior to 1900, Americans consumed less than 30 grams of sugar per day, or about 6% of total calories.
Of the 600,000 food items available in the US, 80% are laced with added sugar.
Extreme poverty is almost synonymous with extreme isolation, especially rural isolation.
If an individual does not have a cell phone, they almost surely know someone who does.
On the fully commercial side, the mobile revolution is creating a logistics revolution in farm-to-retail marketing.
In my book The End of Poverty , I wrote that extreme poverty can be ended by the year 2025.
The terror attacks demonstrated not only how particular people helped each other, but also how the whole city, with all the ingredients of its human mixture, displayed a common spirit of resilience.
Ethnic and cultural conflicts today, often in the form of terrorism, are not the eruption of a supposedly extinct volcano.
It is a far cry even from such doubtful claims as the self-determination of peoples defined as ethnic communities.
The Diplomacy of the Blind
Historical and geographic proximity, together with energy dependency and fear of massive immigration, paralyzed European diplomats.
By emphasizing the relations between states and governments over contacts with the opposition or civil societies (when they exist in an identifiable form), traditional diplomacy has created for itself a handicap that is difficult to overcome.
By being late in perceiving change that they do not want to see coming, Western diplomats run the risk of losing on both levels: the regime and the people.
But negotiation must also demonstrate that everything that could be done has in fact been done before further steps – especially the highly risky and fraught decision to take military action – are considered.
The Israelis also see with greater clarity than many in the world the nature of the likely successor regime in Syria (hint: it will probably not be comprised exclusively of Facebook and Twitter users).
Many countries will be unlikely to support a military solution until they have seen genuine efforts at other means of persuasion (and coercion) fail.
At first glance, much of Europe’s current debate is about political and economic integration – about how far its nation states should go in pooling resources and sovereign powers in the European Union.
About one-third of male workers in Europe quit their jobs by their early fifties.

Soon afterwards, many friends and I formed the International Committee for Democracy in Cuba.
Those of us who live in Europe’s new post-communist democracies experienced similar political deals when we lived behind the former Iron Curtain.
Many European politicians who have sought to see the situation on the ground have been barred in recent years.
We must never forget the seemingly anonymous victims of Castro’s “acts of rejection.”
“We must meet the forces of hate with soul force.”
In Gandhi’s own time, non-violence could have done nothing to prevent the slaughter of Jews in Hitler’s path.
Gandhi believed in “weaning an opponent from error by patience, sympathy, and self-suffering.”
Yet too few who have tried his methods worldwide have had his personal integrity or moral stature.
But his triumph did not “change the world forever.”
With those constraints gone, nationalism in both its Bismarckian state-making and ethnic state-breaking guises has gotten a second wind.
Moreover, it was achieved without a shot being fired.
Scottish nationalists do look longingly at Ireland, but for its recent phenomenal economic growth.
Equally, it is now far harder for Scots to blame a distant government in London for their problems, although the SNP will now try to make blaming Westminster for all ills even more of an art form.
The just-concluded deal establishes a bridge between the old climate regime and a new, as-yet-undefined one.
But the talks failed to deliver a comprehensive, legally binding agreement, causing investors to lose confidence in a low-carbon economy and delaying progress by several years.
The only hope is an international movement for immediate action, such as that which, in advance of the Copenhagen conference, compelled the world’s largest carbon emitters – including the United States and China – to set emissions targets.
The path to an international agreement strong enough to keep global warming under two degrees will be fraught with obstacles.
Successful multilateral trade negotiations have significantly shaped the world in which we live and have dramatically enhanced the lives of millions of people.
The non-discrimination principle ensured that global trade did not become a “spaghetti bowl” of preferential bilateral trade agreements.
Indeed, the current rush to bilateral trade agreements has been accompanied by a rise in protectionism.
It is not too late to reverse the apparently inexorable tide of bilateralism.
Indeed, the danger is already real: when I was in Geneva a year ago and staying at the upscale Mandarin Oriental, I asked the concierge how far away the WTO was. He looked at me and asked: “Is the World Trade Organization a travel agency?”
Never have cause and effect been so dramatically reversed in arguments over trade policy.
The Dollar and the Dragon
In this case, interdependence has created a “balance of financial terror” analogous to the Cold War, when the US and the Soviet Union never used their potential to destroy each other in a nuclear exchange.
While China has taken minor measures to slow the increase in its dollar-denominated holdings, it has been unwilling to risk a fully convertible currency for domestic political reasons.
This is not acceptable. This cannot last.”
CAMBRIDGE – The rapid rise in the price of oil and the sharp depreciation of the dollar are two of the most noteworthy developments of the past year.
The thinking behind the question of whether oil would cost less today if it were priced in euros seems to be that, since the dollar has fallen relative to the euro, this would have contained the rise in the price of oil.
That is only true to the extent that we think about the price of oil in dollars, since the dollar has fallen relative to other major currencies.
CAMBRIDGE – Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, recently suggested that replacing the dollar with the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights as the dominant reserve currency would bring greater stability to the global financial system.
But, while the euro’s international role – especially its use in financial markets – has increased since its inception, it is hard to envisage it overtaking the dollar as the dominant reserve currency in the foreseeable future.
Back in 1980, the IMF came close to adopting a so-called SDR Substitution Account.
What about possible losses suffered by the Substitution Account? This can be dealt with by setting aside part of the IMF’s large gold stock.
Supported by a dollar-denominated line of credit, the EPU’s 15 Western European member states established exact dollar exchange-rate parities as a prelude to anchoring their domestic price levels and removing all currency restrictions on intra-European trade.
Moreover, the US protests other countries’ exchange-rate policies.
The claim that exchange-rate appreciation will reduce a country’s trade surplus is false, because, in globally integrated economies, domestic investment falls when the exchange rate appreciates.
The cooperation of China, now the world’s largest exporter and US creditor, is essential for easing and encouraging the transition to this nirvana.
What makes their struggle loom so large for a normally quiescent Egyptian public is partly that nearly all 9,000 judges are standing fast in solidarity.
Now only 350,000 serve in the military, while the internal security police recently hit the one-million mark.
These symbolic as well as lethal warnings to a family that has grown Pharaonic in scale, style, and power have gone unheeded.
Justice is a central value for Egyptians, and its absence is at the core of all protests.
It is not long ago that job creation was negative and the unemployment rate stood at 10%.
And, remember, this number excludes all the discouraged Americans who are no longer looking for a job.
The economy is still struggling to provide a sufficient number of jobs for those who were previously employed in leverage-driven activities that are no longer sustainable (let alone desirable).
A better mix of fiscal and monetary policies and sustained measures to enhance productivity and competitiveness remain necessary conditions for addressing America’s labor-market challenges.
In 1969, the Chinese and Soviet armies exchanged fire across their disputed border.
As a general principle of foreign policy, China believes that national borders are sacrosanct.
Other than oil, gas, and other commodities, China has rather limited interests in Russia.
As for Russia’s Far East, the Chinese believe it will eventually fall to China anyway, so there is no need to hasten the process.
Clarke and von Braun encountered a wall of skepticism when their proposals first appeared.
The movie depicted a large space station, a winged space shuttle, a lunar base, and astronauts on a trip to the outer solar system.
Nor has the US space shuttle accomplished its goals.
Kubrick suggested that people – accompanied by a computer – would pilot spacecraft to explore planets like Jupiter and Saturn.
The Dutch Retreat
The Germans, in particular, have no stomach for military aggression, hence their reluctance in Afghanistan to take on anything but simple police tasks.
Then, too, pacifism had nothing to do with what happened.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO suddenly found itself without a clear goal (and the Germans no longer needed to be kept down).
The only solution to this problem is for Europeans to reduce their dependence on the US and take greater responsibility for their own defense.
This resulted in crop failures and famine, and some historians argue that it helped to precipitate the French Revolution.
Although it is too early to judge, opinion polls suggest that the British people do at least like the look and the purpose of the current one.
The Conservatives have agreed to hold a referendum on whether Britain should change its first-past-the-post electoral system to an alternative-vote arrangement.
The Liberals, meanwhile, have a golden opportunity to show that they are capable of government, rather than simply flakey representatives of the “None of the Above” party.
A “New Institutional Economics” (NIE) gained ground by filling in the gaps left by mainstream models, which ignored the central importance of institutions in managing the change and uncertainty that affect resource allocation and social choice.
Fukuyama argues that patrimonialism – defined as the natural human propensity to favor family and friends – is the bane of the rule of law and accountable government.
North argues that competition is a key force driving adaptive efficiency among institutions.
The meeting is a welcome development. But Abe comes into office with a reputation as a stronger nationalist than his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, whose insistence on visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine (where Class A war criminals from World War II are buried) helped sour relations with China.
Containment was unfeasible, because, unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, China’s neighbors did not see it as a clear and present danger.
The key to military power in today’s information age depends on the ability to integrate complex systems of space-based surveillance, high speed computers, and “smart” weapons.
The most contentious issue, however, has been prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and, until Abe’s visit, China had been reluctant to engage in any summit meetings with Japan so long as such visits continue.
The US should quietly try to nudge these steps forward.
Its promise to act was enough to calm markets.
It might seem odd for foreigners to weigh in on a question of German law. But the stakes are too high to remain on the sidelines.
In particular, they did not see the Fed as a lender of last resort.
The OMT program is a step in this direction.
The ECB should act with greater alacrity not because there are increased prospects for future growth, but for the opposite reason: the fear that European growth will slow, thus limiting the possibility for future rate hikes.
This implies an interval of two months between interest-rate moves instead of the three-month interval that has become standard ECB practice in the current interest-rate cycle. The next rate hike in the normalization process is expected in October, two months after the expected August move.
But the recent good economic numbers coming out of France should make an October rate hike easier for French politicians to accept.
The problem is that a very long list of exceptions reduces the recoverable assets to such an extent that in many cases it will still be impossible to make do without public money.
Instead, by weakening safety standards, bailing out foreign investors, and financing current-account deficits, the ECB has undercut and replaced the private European interbank market.
In each case, a major objective was to reduce the burden on the ECB, which had advanced the money by printing it and would have run into serious difficulties without help.
Sarkozy stands ready to pounce on any mistakes the Bank may make in this more difficult policy environment.
The euro is at record levels, oil prices are surging and interest rates are expected to go higher.
But if it goes too fast, the political cost could be substantial and irreversible. Politicians will push for more control and probably get it, Maastricht treaty or no Maastricht treaty.
There is no doubt that Sarkozy’s attacks on the ECB are having a counter-productive effect in this regard.
The ECB’s surprise liquidity operation put the continent’s crisis on hold.
And German public-sector workers obtained an agreement at the end of March that boosts wages by 6.3% in the coming two years.
Where spending cuts should, in principle, help to dampen inflation, European governments, like that of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, are backtracking on their budgetary commitments.
The ECB will object, not without reason, that monetary policy is a blunt instrument with which to rebalance the European economy.
But now the ECB no longer wants to do it, and is urging eurozone members to step in.
The amount of the ECB’s “replacement lending” is shown by the so-called Target2 account, which measures the deficit or surplus of a country’s financial transactions with other countries.
Unconventional measures were necessary to prevent their economies from collapsing.
Setting a cap on Target accounts is a fundamentally more appropriate policy to keep current-account deficits in check than the wage policies contemplated by the new Pact for the Euro.
But the announcement of this policy change at the February meeting also did not go smoothly.
Calm economic waters had given the ECB and Trichet a honeymoon until last fall.
The ECB should be preparing Europeans for what many of its own officials admit in private: Europe has not “de-coupled” from the US.
Yet these tools are relentlessly misrepresented to the public.
And GM crops currently in development will deliver even more direct and easily identifiable consumer benefits.
As a result, by 2007, global corn and soybean prices were nearly 6% and 10% lower, respectively, than they would have been had farmers not embraced these crops.
STANFORD – November’s mid-term elections were a sharp rebuke to the vast expansion of government spending, deficits, and debt in the United States.
Moreover, the changed Congressional landscape will be better for trade-related legislation.
A showdown also looms over tax policy.
Meanwhile, most political analysts do not expect Obama to make as large a move to the political center as President Bill Clinton did when the Republicans took control of Congress after the 1994 mid-term elections.
NEW YORK – Political turmoil in the Middle East has powerful economic and financial implications, particularly as it increases the risk of stagflation, a lethal combination of slowing growth and sharply rising inflation.
But there is a serious chance that the uprisings will spread, destabilizing Bahrain, Algeria, Oman, Jordan, Yemen, and eventually even Saudi Arabia.
If oil prices rise much further – towards the peaks of 2008 – the advanced economies will slow sharply; many might even slip back into recession.
The goal should be to stabilize these countries’ economies as they undertake their delicate political transitions.
Now, imagine that, of that total, the companies pay out $250 in dividends (which you reinvest to buy more stock) and retain $450 in earnings to reinvest in their businesses.
But there appear to be two main explanations.
The first reason betrays a lack of trust that governments can and will do the job that they learned how to do in the Great Depression: keep the flow of spending stable so that big depressions with long-lasting, double-digit unemployment do not recur.
For the past quarter-century, a major agenda item for the international development organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has been to bolster developing nations’ financial markets.
Worse still for some theories of what makes financial markets flourish are the examples of the US, Great Britain, and Japan.
In a stable political environment, informal mechanisms – such as reputations for reliability, trade associations, and stock exchanges – can develop and facilitate financial dealings. Investors and businesses don’t fear that a new regime can take power and call off all, or too many, bets, leading to losses on their investments.
By contrast, democratic regimes with widespread property ownership typically best protect property rights over the long term, because enough people in the polity want to protect property.
A quicker and more concerted response might have limited the fall-out from the crisis, and thus its cost.
The European Central Bank has played a crucial role in preventing a worst-case scenario, but the obvious lacuna in Europe’s economic and monetary union (EMU) remains: EMU established only a monetary union and largely omitted the economic union that has proven so closely linked to the euro’s strengths and weaknesses.
This intergovernmental approach lay behind the Lisbon Agenda’s failure to deliver the results needed to make Europe more competitive and dynamic by 2010, and the same shortcomings will bedevil its successor, the new “Europe 2020” strategy.
I have been arguing for a Community Act that would bring together all elements of economic governance under a single framework, with the European Commission at its center.
Against this backdrop, the time has come to reconsider the basic sources of happiness in our economic life.
Here are some of the initial conclusions.
It is weakening social trust and mental stability, with the prevalence of clinical depression apparently on the rise. The mass media have become outlets for corporate “messaging,” much of it overtly anti-scientific, and Americans suffer from an increasing range of consumer addictions.
CAMBRIDGE – As the world watches the United States grapple with its fiscal future, the contours of the battle reflect larger social and philosophical divisions that are likely to play out in various guises around the world in the coming decades.
The government, of course, is the consummate service-intensive sector.
So, even as economic conservatives demand spending cuts, there are strong forces pushing in the other direction.
But one should not presume that a shift to greater private-sector provision of services is a panacea.
The Economics of Peace in Afghanistan
Unless the participants are empowered and take ownership, programs will not be sustainable, resources will go to waste, and peace will not endure.
In doing so, remember that the “vagueness versus specificity” dilemma also applies to economic issues.
This often means accepting that optimal and best-practice economic policies are not attainable – or, indeed, even desirable.
Final sales to households, businesses, and foreign buyers rose at only a 1.1% annual rate, even slower than earlier in the year.
Even those who are working are seeing their incomes shrink.
Industrial production has been unchanged for the past two months, and utilization of industrial capacity has declined.
But the state of the economy is usually the most important determinant of who wins national elections in the United States.
Why hasn’t the huge spike in oil prices cut the world to its knees, as it has on so many other occasions? Again, the answer is low interest rates.
As a consequence, they are crowding into bonds and debt instruments that they view, rightly or wrongly, as safe vehicles.
True, some economists point to the halcyon days of the 1950’s and early 1960’s, when Europe, the US, and Japan prospered, but interest rates generally remained well below the rate of economic growth.
Certain individuals, however, are more susceptible to the negative effects of its use.
Of course, the existence of a positive correlation between cannabis use and psychosis does not allow us to draw a direct causal link between the two.
A comparison of the two most common types of cannabis in the United Kingdom, hash and sinsemilla (“skunk”), found that using skunk implied a significantly greater risk of psychosis, while hash did not.
However, a recent study that followed people from birth to age 38 found that those who started using cannabis early, every day, and for several years had a permanent 8-point drop in IQ scores.
With its 85 million people and strategically vital location, Egypt is the most important country on the Mediterranean’s southern shore.
That precedent is, without doubt, dangerous for a fledgling democracy.
The project is being pursued in the face of strong Egyptian objections – military intervention has been threatened – yet it continues apace.
Turkish foreign policy had sought to create a regional order, with the participation of other Sunni Islamic regimes, in accordance with the country’s interests.
Those who filled Tahrir Square 16 months ago were silenced, and the expected transfer of power from the military to a civilian, democratic government was thrown into doubt.
Others do not believe that the Muslim Brotherhood will go so far, but nonetheless doubt that the Brothers will defend a secular, truly democratic regime in the ongoing negotiations with SCAF on a transition to civilian rule.
For now, the Brothers have announced that they will name a Christian and a woman as Vice Presidents.
Unfortunately, while angry protesters have sometimes forced unwelcome rulers out of power, they have been unable to replace tyrants with governments that respect the public’s wishes.
The army’s lower ranks are now filled with young men, drawn from all segments of Egyptian society, whose backgrounds are no different from those of the people they may be called upon to suppress.
Mubarak’s promise that he would not run for re-election this coming September, which might have mollified his critics two weeks earlier, was no longer enough.
Should violence increase, ordinary soldiers would likely once again feel duty-bound to intervene to restore order and prevent further bloodshed.
Namun demikian, dampak keseluruhannya sering dinilai tidak cukup, khususnya di negara-negara yang rentan atau sedang mengalami konflik – dan MDG telah gagal memasukkan keberlanjutan di dalam targetnya.
Keputusan-keputusan yang diambil pada tahun ini, pada pertemuan puncak SDG dan konferensi iklim di Paris pada bulan Desember, akan memiliki dampak yang besar bagi masa depan planet kita.
Globalisasi telah menyebabkan lemahnya kontrak sosial di dalam negara-bangsa dan bahkan antar benua.
Untuk menerapkan SDG dan mengurangi perubahan iklim, perubahan besar diperlukan untuk beranjak dari model ekonomi kita yang bergantung pada bahan bakar fosil.
These new forms of money sound like power windows on cars, or remote control for TV sets.
The reason is straightforward.
One could easily establish and operate a business selling food by the serving or providing small household items to anyone who happened to pass by.
This fee structure makes it difficult to run a business selling items for less than ten dollars, and impossible to run a business selling items for less than one dollar: transaction costs eat up the profits.
What iTunes sells is one form of intellectual content.
India’s last two governments each served a full term and presided over significant economic growth, even though they comprised 23 and 20 parties, respectively.
In that case, a “hung parliament” could see a “third front” coming to power as a minority government, supported tactically by one of the big parties.
The BJP, which accuses Congress of “appeasing” India’s minorities, hews to a staunchly Hindu-chauvinist line, and has received support from some of the most bigoted and intolerant sections of Indian society.
Indian democracy has often been likened to the stately progress of the elephant – ponderous in its gait and reluctant to change course, but not easily swayed from its new path when it does.
Indigenous children have a significantly lower chance of educational success. Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Paraguay lag behind even other Latin American countries.
First, there is credible evidence that children who are better nourished in their first years of life stay in school longer and learn more each year that they remain there.
In Colombia, scholarships were provided to 125,000 students from poor, urban communities in the early 1990’s.
The most expensive programs aren’t necessarily the most successful.
Thus, “’68” symbolized the end of revolutionary myths – to the benefit of liberation movements extending from the 1970’s until now.
In France, conservatism was so entrenched on both the left and the right that both missed the movement’s meaning and could only fall back on stereotyped revolutionary interpretations.
Of course, some people have never overcome the end of the ecstasy of those five weeks of craziness and joy, while others still wait for “’68” to culminate in God only knows what kind of “D-Day.”
That world has been replaced by a multilateral world, which includes AIDS, unemployment, energy and climate crises, and so on.
At the moment, the Financial Stability Board, whose members include the G-20 countries, mainly pursues initiatives in this field.
Emerging economies, following the advanced countries, also attached less importance to Fund surveillance, especially as their accumulation of external assets made them less dependent on IMF financing and advice.
An example of this is the way the IMF’s Decision on Bilateral Surveillance over Members’ Policies, aimed at identifying fundamental exchange-rate misalignments, was modified to allow greater discretion in surveillance, especially over exchange rates.
The real danger is that adjustment would take place even later, with imbalances left to accumulate for a longer period of time.
But, while things are not developing as American neo-conservatives had intended, they are nevertheless developing.
Today, the old Middle East can still be found in Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, and Fatah-controlled Palestine.
The dominant conflict is no longer the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, but the threat of a confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia for sub-regional supremacy, and between Iran and the US for regional hegemony.
More generally, the currency of conventional military power in the Middle East would largely lose its value, inevitably resulting in a regional nuclear arms race.
So, what will they do – and, perhaps more important, what will economic forces do to them?
Unless the renminbi falls in value, this translates into an average nominal increase of at least 10-11% in dollar terms.
More focus on innovation and creativity will be accompanied by strong real wage growth, provision of greater rights for urban migrants, and expansion of health care and pensions.
One is growing evidence of a housing recovery; the other is the prospect of steadily declining energy-import costs as domestic production, particularly of natural gas, continues to rise.
Emerging-market economies have not only cushioned the global impact of the recent crisis, but have also helped industrialized countries reverse the recessionary trend of 2008-2009.
During the crisis, annual growth slowed, but only to 6.7%, reflecting the economy’s inherent resilience.
While the public sector will continue to play an important role, given the massive investment required, substantial private investment – including foreign investment – would be needed to address India’s huge “infrastructure deficit” and the financing gap that accompanies it.
The Emotional Clash of Civilizations
Rather than a “clash of civilizations,” we might instead be faced by multiple layers of conflict, which interact with each other in ways that increase global instability.
We live in a secular world, where free speech can easily turn into insensitive and irresponsible mockery, while others see religion as their supreme goal, if not their last hope.
It has become an obsession.
The Empire of Human Rights
Indeed, none of the Asian members disagreed when the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.
You are obliged to take care of your family, your friends, or even your fellow countrymen.
It has, nonetheless, become a commonly held opinion that democracy, like universal human rights, is a typically Western idea, and that Asian autocracy, as practiced in China, for example, is not only more suited to Asians, but also more efficient.
But, despite a flurry of early initiatives, the world remains as far from that goal as ever.
The G-20 promised stronger global institutions to prevent this from recurring.
But the greater voice and voting power that they were promised – commensurate with their status as four of the IMF’s top ten shareholders – has not been delivered.
But the Bank is also hampered by worsening resource constraints, as the biggest post-crisis capital infusions went to regional development banks.
The End of an Era in Finance
The IMF’s policy note makes clear that controls on cross-border financial flows can be not only desirable, but also effective.
There is some empirical research on the consequences of capital controls in countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Malaysia, but very little systematic research on the appropriate menu of options.
Set at a very low level – 0.05% is a commonly mentioned rate – such a tax would raise hundreds of billions of dollars for global public goods while discouraging short-term speculative activities in financial markets.
BARCELONA ­– Are banks doomed as a result of the current financial crisis? The securitization of mortgages originally was seen as a triumph, because it shifted risk to financial markets, while taking deposits and making and monitoring loans – the purview of traditional banks – was regarded as narrow and old-fashioned.
Others may follow soon.
Indeed, even if things turned ugly and banks’ equity suffered, executives knew that their own generous bonuses and pension packages most likely would not.
But when you can play with others’ money and expect a very high reward for success and no punishment for failure, the incentives for irresponsible risk-taking become enormous.
This diminishes the value of these countries’ foreign-exchange reserves, endangers their fiscal and exchange-rate policies, and undermines their financial security.
Despite such low returns, China has continued to invest its reserves in the US, largely owing to the inability of its own under-developed financial market to generate a sufficient supply of safe assets.
The End of China’s Surplus
After all, the policies that China will implement in the next few years target the country’s enormous saving rate – the cause of its large current-account surplus.
These policies are motivated by domestic considerations, as the Chinese government seeks to raise living standards more rapidly than the moderating growth rate of GDP.
This would cause a shift from exports to production for the domestic market, thereby shrinking the trade surplus, in addition to curbing inflation.
Macroeconomists celebrated the “Great Moderation” of the global business cycle, with recessions seeming to become milder and less frequent.
It is ironic indeed that US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, a former head of Goldman Sachs, a firm that exemplifies financial triumphalism, is spearheading the effort to save government-sponsored behemoths that have so conspicuously outlived their usefulness.
For a while, it consistently made outsized profits, supposedly due to its Nobel-prize backed financial expertise.
Financial innovation ought to be allowed to flourish, but not without better checks and balances.
Maastricht was thus intended to prevent a situation like the current one in Greece.
In theory, strict in-depth monitoring could distinguish genuinely prudent countercyclical responses from profligacy. But in practice it is hard to enforce.
Moreover, in the United States, there are rules and conventions (similar to Maastricht) that disallow or discourage states from running long-term deficits.
The EU’s leaders recently stated their intention to revisit the Maastricht structure, which in principle is a good idea.
That would enable effective enforcement of fiscal discipline at the national level and provide the euro with the fiscal discipline it needs to survive.
But, despite street protests, the collective reaction in Japan has not been to repudiate nuclear energy.
Germany’s nuclear plants will be replaced by more thermal plants, implying a large increase in German carbon emissions – so much for Green concern with global warming! And so much for intellectual honesty, because a Germany without nuclear power of its own will be compelled to buy it from France, which has no intention of closing its nuclear plants.
The great irony of the current situation is that real innovation and entrepreneurial activity, without government support, is taking place in the field of energy generation, such as in the creation of miniaturized nuclear reactors.
The End of History Comes to Tunisia
But, while a widespread consensus held that communism was nothing but a dead end, China’s economic success, and the authoritarian backlash in Russia following Boris Yeltsin’s departure from the Kremlin a decade ago, prompted a more pessimistic analysis.
Challenging the “myth of the autocratic revival,” the American political scientists Daniel Deudney and John Ikenberry have examined China and Russia, finding “little evidence for the emergence of a stable equilibrium between capitalism and autocracy such that this combination could be dignified as a new model of modernity.” While neither country qualifies as a liberal democracy, both “are much more liberal and democratic than they have ever been, and many of the crucial foundations for sustainable liberal democracy are emerging” – one main hurdle being the centrifugal forces that democracy might unleash.
Moreover, Tunisia’s revolution was indigenous, not imported as part of some forcible regime change.
But history does not end, and it is forever full of surprises.
In Europe, the Vatican lobbied for acknowledgement of God in the preamble to the proposed European Constitutional Treaty.
The response by enlightened communities is therefore important.
South Africa’s internal problems, most notably the upsurge in the AIDS epidemic, have been well documented since the ANC came to power more than ten years ago, but the country’s stance as a player within the international community has been less obvious.
Such powers seek an effective and constructive regional role, and possibly, in some instances, a global one.
In the face of Western and, in particular, American skepticism about South Africa’s failure, and that of the Africa Union, to engineer an acceptable outcome to the Zimbabwean crisis, money may not be forthcoming.
3. A government that kept its nose out of people’s economic business.
That foundation had a hard enough time functioning when human societies had 60 members – eight orders of magnitude less than our current global society’s six billion.
We also believe that government should play a powerful role in managing the market to avoid large depressions, redistributing income to produce higher social welfare, and preventing pointless industrial structuring produced by the fads and fashions that sweep the minds of financiers.
The write-off of multilateral debt for the world’s poorest countries – thanks to Britain’s leadership – is nonetheless especially welcome.
Of course, not all foreign-aid money is well spent.
A simple project like this can make an enormous difference to the life of a community.
Equally important, historically much foreign aid was provided not to promote development, but to purchase friendship, especially during the Cold War.
Total capital assets of central banks worldwide amount to $18 trillion, or 19% of global GDP – twice the level of ten years ago. This gives them plenty of ammunition to guide market interest rates lower as they combat the weakest recovery since the Great Depression.
The result will be chain reactions similar to those seen in Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, with a vicious circle of sovereign and bank debt leading to credit-rating downgrades and a sharp increase in bond yields. Japan’s own debt crisis will then erupt with full force.
Moreover, China’s aging population, and its strategy of boosting domestic consumption, will negatively affect global savings.
During the global financial crisis, even the safety of bank deposits and government bonds was in doubt for some investors.
Thus, firms have little pricing power, owing to excess capacity, while workers’ bargaining power is low, owing to high unemployment.
The time to buy gold is when the real returns on cash and bonds are negative and falling.
But, given the absence of any conspiracy, falling inflation, and the inability to use gold as a currency, such arguments cannot be sustained.
Ten years ago, comparing the reform processes in China and Russia was an intellectual fashion.
Indeed, Russia is more a fragile oil-producing state than a modernizing economic giant.
The diverse paths followed by Russia and China may be explained in part by how the two peoples perceive themselves.
The gap between the respective qualities of China’s economic and scientific elites, on the one hand, and its ruling political elites, on the other, is simply too monumental – and still growing – for stability to be taken for granted.
But, however fundamental the current differences might be, it is the underlying suspicion that Obama is poised to shift America away from its unique relationship with the Jewish state that most worries Israelis.
Devoid of sentimental attachment to Israel’s cause and deeply disturbed by its policies in the occupied territories, Obama represents the specter of a White House where neither love nor interests are shared with the Jewish state.
It is because Netanyahu is driven by an almost Messianic determination to prevent Iran from acquiring the means to destroy Israel, that he might be amenable to a fundamental change in his position on Palestine, provided Obama makes visible headway in his drive to stop Iran’s nuclear program.
From a military perspective, Israel eventually won all of these wars – or at least didn’t lose them.
Everything else is evil wishful thinking for which more innocents will continue losing their lives.
Whatever becomes of Hamas in military terms following the recent fighting in Gaza, politically it has finally taken over the PLO’s role as the legitimate representative of the Palestinians.
The alternative to a two-state solution is continuation of the conflict and the de facto reality of a one-state solution in which Palestinians between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean will, sooner rather than later, constitute a majority.
After a victory by the left-wing Syriza party, Greece’s new government announces that it wants to renegotiate the terms of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.
His government fails to get the necessary support from voters and resigns, throwing the country into full-blown political chaos.
China’s government decides that it cannot risk further strife and announces a package of measures to boost economic growth and prevent layoffs, including direct financial support for exporters and intervention in the currency markets to weaken the renminbi.
Those that do relatively well share three characteristics: low levels of public debt, limited dependence on exports or capital flows, and robust democratic institutions.
Many years later, Merkel, who has withdrawn from politics and become a recluse, is asked whether she thinks that she should have done anything differently during the euro crisis.&nbsp; Unfortunately, her answer comes too late to change the course of history.
But China's labor productivity is now growing at roughly 6% per year.
Things have value when they are both desirable and scarce.
At the same time, the United States will oppose any Iranian nuclear program – even a civilian program – because this will contribute to the stability of the regime in Tehran.
Nuclear power offers the possibility of cheap, plentiful electricity, which will contribute to social and political stability.
However, domestic pressure, a sense of nationalism, and the need to improve its bargaining position with Western countries might force the Iranian government to respond to harsh UN sanctions or an air attack on its nuclear facilities.
MILAN – I have been surprised by the recent coverage in the American press of gasoline prices and politics.
On the supply side, there is a similar difference between short-term and longer-run effects.
A substantial failure of education about non-renewable natural resources lies in the background of current public sentiment.
Now these policies have to be reversed, which implies similar political challenges and costs.
If criticism of democratic governance on the grounds of its “inevitable short time horizon” were correct, it would be hard to explain how India, a populous, complex, and still-poor democracy, could sustain long-term investments and policies required to support rapid growth and development.
At some point, voters will react against a system that amplifies differences and suppresses shared goals, and policy formation will revert to its more effective pragmatic mode.
Yet the undoubted origin of the conflict is the region’s extreme poverty, which was made disastrously worse in the 1980’s by a drought that has essentially lasted until today.
The economic takeoff of these two giants started 40 years ago with the introduction of higher agricultural output and an end to famines.
Thus, environmental pressures are now hitting the bottom line – affecting incomes and livelihoods around the world.
At the global level, the world’s governments should finally understand that the treaties that they have all signed in recent years on climate, environment, and biodiversity are at least as important to global security as all of the war zones and crisis hotspots that grab the headlines, budgets, and attention.
In fact, the exploitation of non-renewable resources frees the speed of economic growth from that of ecological renewal, aggravating the deterioration of the biosphere, including irreversible climate changes.
The only way to overcome the finiteness of our world is to maintain as much space as possible between entropy and history by investing in education and research aimed at increasing renewable energies, reducing the energy intensity of our standards of living, and slowing the pace of environmental erosion.
The Commission’s approach is misguided.
But their ability to grow is being impaired because they lack the resources to confront the massive business lobbies of the EU’s most developed and richest countries.
Additional emissions would occur when the goods are transported back to the EU.
The Error of the War on Terror
The war-on-terror concept stands in the way of recognizing this fact because it separates “us” from “them” and denies that our actions may shape their behavior.
This contributed to Hamas’s electoral victory.
Similarly, the US has become less safe since President Bush declared war on terror.
The people of Palestine yearn for peace and relief from suffering.
Russians are particularly outraged by Putin’s arrogant treatment of the presidency as an office that can be “loaned” to allies – like the current incumbent, Dmitri Medvedev – and reclaimed whenever he wishes.
Nor does he have any anxiety about the damage that his misrule portends for Russia’s future.
No one should be deceived by any concessions that the Kremlin makes.
The Eternal Life of America’s Megabanks
Essentially, this is a form of bankruptcy, but with more administrative discretion (and presumably more protection for depositors) than would be possible in a court-supervised process.
This is exactly what happened when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, and what happened when AIG was taken over by the US government (actually in a resolution-type structure, with losses implied for creditors) two days later.
And of course the credit markets know this, so they lend more cheaply to JP Morgan Chase and other megabanks than to smaller banks that really can fail.
Putin can’t help himself, just as he couldn’t help himself in 2004.
The only freedom Russians have left is to devise bitter jokes that tap the country’s rich historical stores of political pathology. If they could export them, they would be as rich as Germans.
Today, Russia’s rulers have never looked more arbitrary and illegitimate. After 12 years in power, and grasping for 12 more, Putin can no longer sustain the pretense of adhering to democracy and promoting modernization.
The Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989 much more rapidly than most West Germans would have dreamed (or dreaded).
It is no longer a traumatic experience, just a bureaucratic hassle.
As time goes by, Israelis and Palestinians increasingly want to divorce themselves from each other.
The British minister responsible for the test justified the idea by claiming that “the simple act of taking one’s turn is one of the things that holds our country together. It is very important that newcomers take their place in queues whether it is for a bus or a cup of tea.”
It is clearly helpful for immigrants to get hints about how to navigate daily life practically – such as norms about standing in line.
They are akin to language requirements – except that the language here is a civic, not a national one, which in the best case allows new citizens to voice their concerns with perfect political grammar.
The consumption of veal has fallen sharply since it became widely known that to produce so-called “white” – actually pale pink – veal, newborn calves are separated from their mothers, deliberately made anemic, denied roughage, and kept in stalls so narrow that they cannot walk or turn around.
Conditions are, if anything, even worse for laying hens crammed into wire cages so small that even if there were just one per cage, she would be unable to stretch her wings.
The piglets are taken from the sow as soon as possible, so that she can be made pregnant again, but they never leave the shed until they are taken to slaughter.
BRUSSELS – Two decades ago, Ethiopia was a Cold War battlefield.
Further south, Kenya remains scarred by the aftermath of post-election violence, and its constitutional review process could lead to yet more bloodshed.
Furthermore, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has created what amounts to a one-party state during his 24 years in power, yet he is feted in the West as one of Africa’s visionary leaders.
Ethiopia’s diplomacy will be vital to minimizing the potential for such violence to spread, but Ethiopia can fulfill this role only if it receives strong strategic backing from the West.
The withdrawal of Britain’s Paddy Ashdown as a candidate for the post of UN envoy in Afghanistan means that the international community still has some way to go before it speaks with one voice in that country.
Apart from 1,500 Dutch soldiers in the neighboring Uruzgan province and a Polish and Romanian presence in Ghazni, Paktika, and Zabul, no other EU nations are willing to operate in the insurgency-ridden southern and eastern parts of the country, giving the Taliban free reign.
They fear that more troops may only lead to more civilian casualties, antagonizing Afghans.
And it is to be hoped that whoever is chosen may be able to foster the grand bargain between the US and EU that is so badly needed.
But two steep hurdles still need to be overcome: the intergovernmental conference and ratification through the national parliaments or by means of a referendum in all member states.
Twenty years seems to be what it takes Europe to change, and that is anything but reassuring.
The recalcitrant states achieved a Pyrrhic victory because it will quickly become clear to them that, even if the EU is getting a new institutional framework, the avantgarde countries will decide among themselves what the concrete arrangements will look like.
Fourth, Poland has to ask itself what kind of role it wants to play within the EU.
The time for celebrations will come only after the new treaty is ratified.
Roughly a third of Darfur’s population has been forced from their homes and are now in displaced persons camps inside Sudan, where they remain subject to the Janjaweed terror, or in equally vulnerable refugee settlements in Chad. International humanitarian efforts to help those in Sudan are hampered by Sudanese government harassment and pointless bureaucratic hassles.
At that time, it appeared that a similar breakthrough in western Sudan would follow.
In accordance with the “responsibility to protect” doctrine, adopted unanimously by heads of state and government at the UN World Summit in September 2005, if a state fails to meet this primary obligation, responsibility shifts to the international community, which may exercise various measures, including, if absolutely necessary, military force.
Such targeted sanctions would affect the power and privileges of the key players in this crisis.
Nor do they say much about the obvious dividends that such spending could provide, from the United Kingdom in the west to the EU’s newest candidate country, Croatia, in the east.
And yet the penny has not dropped in London that focusing European investment funds accordingly would create opportunities to build stronger businesses and increase competitiveness in the technologies of the future – and to share these gains within and beyond the EU.
Will Ukraine continue its turn towards the West, as Yushchenko and his Orange Revolution ally Yuliya Tymoshenko want, or return to Russia’s strategic embrace, as Yanukovych and his allies want?
Of course, EU membership gives these countries a greater sense of security.
All of these countries are now acting with great hesitation in the debate about Kosovo, clearly influenced by Russian warnings about “setting a precedent.”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel likes to emphasize, rightly, that one should not speak of a “euro crisis,” but of a “debt crisis.”
But why should a debt problem in economies that are usually called “peripheral” be so important for financial markets? Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, which is now teetering on the brink of insolvency, account for less than 6% of the eurozone economy.
The key areas of weakness in Europe’s financial markets, including undercapitalized banks in core countries, were not addressed, and the system was not able to withstand the second wave of the crisis, triggered by the peripheral countries’ loss of credibility in financial markets.
That, rather than elaborate mechanisms for economic-policy coordination or grand designs for competitiveness, should be at the top of the European Council’s agenda.
Economic integration, it was hoped, would lead to greater understanding, underpinned by the myriad interactions that inevitably flow from commerce.
Indeed, Europe’s success is due in part to its promotion of a set of values that, while quintessentially European, are at the same time global.
Fine distinctions are made, for example, between the rights of citizens and non-citizens.
COPENHAGEN – So far, Europe’s leaders seem to be mostly preoccupied with finding national answers to the global economic crisis.
But then the financial system crumbled growth rates fell like a ton of bricks. The new democracies were shaken as public protests erupted in some of their capitals, and some governments have fallen.
Thus, the sheer magnitude of the task of reviving these economies is not overwhelming. But the political consequences of failure to deliver a message of genuine European solidarity will be.
Solidarity among members is not just something we talk about when the future looks bright and rosy.
Energy, transport infrastructure – roads, railways, and waterways – and crime prevention have all benefited.
To be sure, the EU’s lengthy internal crisis over the proposed constitution was a major distraction, and damaged the Union’s reputation in the Balkans.
Israel’s European Peace?
The nature and posture of the new military-led regime remains to be seen.
Yet the Palestinian Authority demanded their release, Israel’s government obliged, and the US supported the transaction.
Given the EU’s robust relationship with Israel – underpinned by its role as Israel’s largest trade partner, accounting for roughly 26% of total Israeli exports and 34% of its imports – it can develop powerful incentives that could provide the impetus that the peace process needs to succeed.
This is particularly visible in the banking sector.
A government default would thus wipe out the entire Greek banking system.
The definition of what banks should hold for liquidity purposes should have been broadened beyond public debt to include a wide range of private-sector assets based on market size.
Europe’s Smart Asian Pivot
Moreover, the EU has a somewhat paradoxical asset at its disposal: it is not a Pacific power and does not carry the burden of great-power status in Asia.
When the territorial dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands flared anew last year, Japanese auto exports to China plummeted 80% in just three months.
China is facing increasing pressure (particularly from the US) to assume a global political role that corresponds to its economic weight.
Though country-to-country engagement with Asia’s rising powers may be tempting, and while China often prefers bilateral dealings, renationalization of EU members’ foreign policies would be counterproductive.
A half-century of working together, plus a decade and a half of adapting to new threats and demands, is paying off.
So the Taliban are obtaining ample funds from the heroin trade – easily Afghanistan’s largest single source of foreign earnings.
Turf battles with NATO intrude, as well as competition between the EU’s executive Commission and the member-based Council.
But NATO is also acting because some European countries want to show Washington that they can pull their security weight even though they refuse to go near the war in Iraq.
So long as it performed these functions, Austria was viewed as a “European necessity” – a balancer of nationalities and of nations for which there was no conceivable substitute.
Like Austria-Hungary, the EU’s raison d’etre consists in its ability to transcend the indigenous balance of power among its members, and the service this renders to the international system.
But, as Habsburg history shows, such arrangements create entrenched privileges among the “haves” and grudges among the “have-nots.” In a union of many parts, there are no shortcuts: the EU must provide the same level of integration at the periphery as at the imperial core.
The EU vs. Democracy
For example, Bolivia TV devoted 62.7% of its news bulletins to the government party’s candidates, whereas the seven opposition parties combined mustered only a 37.2% share.  This, according to Weber, amounted to an “abuse of institutional propaganda.”
Nor have they shrunk from constitutional tinkering in order to lock in their power. Indeed, they have changed the constitution three times since 1987 to ensure that every vote for the Nationalist Party and the Labor Party is given a higher weighting than votes received by any of the country’s other political parties when it comes to translating votes into parliamentary seats.
For starters, there are more bailouts to come, with Portugal at the top of the list.
It is very difficult for a central government to sit on the sidelines when the economy’s key players are on the brink of collapse.
That is nonsense.
By nationalizing private debts, Europe is following the path of the 1980’s debt crisis in Latin America.
It is worth pausing to commemorate this remarkable event, and the effect the euro’s existence has had on the current global crisis. 
And pricing of goods and labor throughout the currency area, which previously had different exchange rates, becomes much more transparent.
This partially cushions the downturn.
Low inflation, no currency risk, decreased transaction costs, and greater transparency have made the euro a success.
Indeed, avoiding continuous competitive devaluations is more a blessing than a curse.
But that is completely at odds with the historical record: the era of the gold standard is replete with boom-bust episodes fueled by over-borrowing by governments, firms, individuals, or all of the above.
European banks could bulk up in large part because it was assumed that their respective governments backed them.
If exchange rates cannot depreciate, wages and prices need to fall when a country has an unsustainable current-account deficit.
But this is not about Greece any longer.
There is a lot of shouting in the jury room. Expect a verdict soon.
Many battles were fought in the last three years – over Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Italy, to name the main ones.
Moreover, Merkel visited Athens and silenced the voices in her coalition government who were openly calling for Greece’s exit from the euro.
Banking union is a positive development, but there is no agreement on additional reforms, such as the creation of a common fiscal capacity or a common treasury.
So, in practical terms, the difference between reforms that could be implemented and those that are being or will be implemented is less significant than it seems.
Europe’s democratic deficit is less a gap between European institutions and European citizens than between national politics and European problems.
At the same time, because the EU is both a source of wealth creation, through market integration, and of redistributive effects among states, through competition in that market, its decisions’ increasingly majoritarian character requires some democratic notion of distributive fairness. To the extent that European issues can’t still be fully governed by European politics, national politics need to be made more European.
Any new VAT resource should be linked to cross-border transactions, establishing a clear link with the internal market.
It is obvious that politicians and bankers made grave errors that contributed to the current crisis.
The dream of European unity evidently induced some to remain silent in an effort to preserve the euro project’s visionary goodwill.
The Euro’s Imagined Community
So, it is not alarmist to worry aloud about preserving the sense of community that Europe has enjoyed for the past half-century.
The new narrative was reinforced with physical symbols, akin to a currency or a flag, in the form of belts of beads made of wampum, the Iroquois’ money.
Every currency union chooses symbols of common cultural values for its coins and notes, and these symbols become part of the sense of shared identity.
The point is that if Europe can keep these symbols alive, even a eurozone breakup would not have the dire political consequences for Europe that so many predict.
Yet little was done.
Lower interest rates, for example, would free up money so that even countries with tight budget constraints could spend more on growth-enhancing investments.
The single-market principle was supposed to promote the efficient allocation of capital and labor.
If sound policies are implemented and better institutions established –&nbsp;which does not mean only more austerity and better supervision of banks, budgets, and deficits –&nbsp;and growth is restored, these countries will be able to meet their debt obligations, and there will be no need to call upon the guarantees.
No one seems to have the power to impose a sensible resolution of its peripheral countries’ debt crisis.
It will stop spreading only when Germany constructs a firm and credible firewall, presumably around Spanish and Italian central-government debt. This is exactly the kind of hardheaded solution that one would see in a truly integrated currency area.
The peripheral countries might just experience enough growth to sustain their ambitious austerity commitments.
Unfortunately, an ultra-soft IMF is the last thing Europe needs right now.
But it is hard to see how the single currency can survive much longer without a decisive move towards a far stronger fiscal union.
But – and here’s the point – with its debts written off, the banking system is now recapitalized and able to support economic growth.
The arithmetic is simply horrible.
The alternative for Greece is to manage its default in an orderly manner.
The Germans and French would need to inject new capital into their banks (perhaps finally becoming open to tighter regulation to prevent this from happening again), and the whole world would become more wary about lending to profligate sovereigns.
Under the umbrella of common deposit insurance, US savings banks made a “gamble for resurrection” – borrowing excessively from their depositors and lending the money out to risky enterprises, knowing that potential profits could be paid out as dividends to shareholders while potential losses would be socialized.
Debt-equity swaps rescue the banks without rescuing their shareholders.
Spanish banks have 7% equity capital on average on their balance sheets.
Back in the early 1990's, American officials like me who were making long-term forecasts for the Clinton administration cautioned that it would be rash to forecast an average long-run growth rate of more than 2.5% per year - and that actual growth might turn out to be even slower.
The value of the cars is calculated in American GDP, but European public-transport systems are counted not at their value to passengers but as a cost to government.
Moreover, European labor productivity figures are inflated by the fact that potential workers who would be less productive are much less likely to hold any jobs at all.
A century later, the Japanese economic miracle had transformed the image of at least a small part of Asia in European eyes into a place of rapid technological and industrial progress.
European economic elites perceive China and India very differently.
BERLIN – Just weeks ago, the worst of the financial crisis in Europe seemed to be over. Stability seemed to be returning.
For the distressed southern European states, the German-backed mixture of austerity and structural reforms is proving fatal, because the decisive third and fourth components – debt relief and growth – are missing.
That is precisely the order of the day in Europe and the eurozone.
Europe’s national politicians routinely criticize the EU for its lack of democratic legitimacy, yet they bear part of the responsibility for it.
The eurozone, it is claimed, should have its own budget to provide similarly automatic insurance to its members.
The federal government intervenes only in the case of major nationwide recessions and provides some supplementary benefits for the long-term unemployed. But this support is given to all states and thus does not provide those most affected with much more support than the others receive.
This leads to a simple conclusion: The euro’s long-term stability depends far more on completing plans for a European banking union than it does on creating some new budget for the eurozone.
Even Germany’s temporary success is riddled with caveats.
It is why Spain and Ireland are in serious trouble, and why even Italy – which is on relatively sounder fiscal footing, but has had flat per capita income for a decade and little structural reform – cannot be complacent.
So a eurozone that needs fiscal austerity, structural reforms, and appropriate macroeconomic and financial policies is weakened politically at both the EU and national levels.
Likewise, debt buybacks would be a massive waste of official resources, as the residual value of the debt increases as it is bought, benefiting creditors far more than the sovereign debtor.
The ECB and creditor banks can live for two or three weeks with a temporary downgrade of Greece’s debt.
To revive growth, the ECB needs to stop raising interest rates and reverse course. The eurozone should also pursue a policy – partially via looser monetary policy – that weakens the value of the euro significantly and restores the periphery’s competitiveness.
Now the eurozone – with a centralized monetary policy, run by the European Central Bank, alongside 27 national fiscal policies – has come to look like a mockery of economic common sense.
A monetary union that does not benefit all of its participants will not survive for long. After the eurozone’s sovereign-debt crisis erupted, defaults were avoided by establishing the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism (since replaced by the European Stability Mechanism), and by crafting a more pragmatic and reinforced role for the ECB (acting with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund).
The Europe 2020 strategy, approved two years ago in part to improve economic governance, is a good starting point, offering the basis for the “growth compact” that some EU governments have sought.
Such a gulf within a monetary union cannot be sustained for very long.
The problem, however, is that a large part of this improvement reflects collapsing domestic demand, which has plummeted by around one-quarter in Greece and Ireland since 2007, and by one-eighth in Spain and Portugal.
Spain’s performance in foreign markets is especially impressive.
The problem, however, is that prices have generally proved much more rigid, declining only in Ireland.
But societies may lose patience in the meantime.
Skeptics have plenty of ammunition for their critique of the euro.
Whenever the dollar was weak, capital surged into alternative currencies, notably the Japanese yen and the German Mark.
Slovenia, which entered the eurozone in 2007, and Slovakia, which joined at the beginning of 2009 – just as the cresting financial crisis slammed shut the door to further euro enlargement – have enjoyed much greater financial stability than their untied neighbors.
European governments are not in a position to instruct the ECB to purchase government bonds.
The eurozone crisis may be entering its third stage.
Indeed, given Germany’s surprisingly impressive employment performance, another Wirtschaftswunder appeared to be in the making.
This trade multiplier is causing European economies to drag each other down, and the rest of the world is feeling the effects.
And, a mere two months later, both countries’ central banks report that even these reduced expectations are too optimistic.
NEW YORK – Since World War II’s end, the global economy’s trade and financial openness has increased, thanks to institutions like the International Monetary Fund and successive rounds of liberalization, starting with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947.
Although the shifting structure of the global economy is best described as a journey taken only once, growth in developing countries does exhibit repeating patterns.
Early high-growth economies – Japan, South Korea, Taiwan – initially exported labor-intensive products, then graduated to more capital-intensive goods like motor vehicles, and then to human-capital-intensive activities like design and technology development.
Indeed, the post-crisis shortfall in domestic demand is causing stubbornly high unemployment, even as the economy recovers some of its growth momentum.
It would be nice if there were an easy and reasonably certain way to accomplish that.
Building on that tradition, member states formed a union based on equality and not dominated by any state or nationality.
This stance led to a dramatic acceleration in European integration, culminating in the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the introduction of the euro in 1999.
When a fiscal crisis hit Greece, the financial world suddenly discovered that eurozone members had put themselves in the position of developing countries.
Economic conditions are continuing to deteriorate, causing immense human suffering.
Europe’s leaders are so preoccupied with the crisis of the day that they have no time to ponder the long-term consequences of their actions.
According to the International Society for Human Rights, 80% of all acts of religious persecution worldwide in 2012 were directed at Christians.
In early April, a funeral at St. Mark’s Cathedral (the seat of the Coptic Church in Cairo) for four Christians killed in sectarian riots days earlier descended into chaos, with thousands of mourners attacked as they tried to leave after the service.
Furthermore, fallout from relentless regional conflict is destabilizing Lebanon, a country that offers Christians a constitutional guarantee of political representation.
It is the “moderates” who must now adapt their policies.
But Assad managed to emerge from Syria’s forced withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005 to become the broker without whom a Lebanese government could not be created and a president could not be elected.
They are crucial players in Lebanon, they have a role to play in pacifying Iraq, they can influence a change of attitude of powerful and extremely destabilizing non-state actors like Hamas and Hezbollah, and their leverage on Hamas is vital for the stability of the Palestinian front.
Ratko Mladic, in combat fatigues, stocky, walking as though through a muddy field; and Radovan Karadzic, taller, wearing a suit, with his wild, but carefully coiffed, shock of white hair.
We had anticipated this moment and agreed in advance that, while we would never ask to meet with Karadzic and Mladic, if Milosevic offered such a meeting, we would accept – but only once, and only under strict guidelines that would require Milosevic to be responsible for their behavior.
When he heard our demand that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately, he exploded.
But while the Dayton agreement gave NATO the authority to capture Karadzic and Mladic, an arrest didn’t occur for nearly 13 years.
Even though almost 13 years is an inexcusably long time, the war crimes indictment kept Karadzic on the run and prevented him from resurfacing.
Attacking a communist country has always seemed to offer American politicians a convenient way to appeal to the average voter.
Moreover, China's geopolitical importance to the US has grown immensely since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. of September 11, 2001.
New York – The World’s central bankers are a close-knit club, given to fads and fashions.
By contrast, US inflation stands at 3%. Does that mean that these developing countries should raise their interest rates far more than the US?
So, what should be done? First, politicians, or central bankers, should not be blamed for imported inflation, just as we should not give them credit for low inflation when the global environment is benign.
But most developing countries do not have the institutional structures, or the resources, to do likewise.
Maybe the collapse stems from lousy internal controls in financial firms that, swaddled by implicit government guarantees, lavish their employees with enormous rewards for risky behavior.
And if the decline in nominal wages signals that there is an excess supply of labor, matters only get worse.
It is easy to see why.
He made the right choice before the Iraq war - America's intervention was never justified and has yielded a terrible failure - and so found himself in sync with an emerging European, even global, opposition to the Bush administration.
Maintaining France's weight within the European Union should have led Chirac to re-confirm Lamy when José Manuel Barroso took over as President of the Commission.
These biases matter because they do not jibe with the enlarged Europe of today.
Of course, this decline must not be overestimated.
I wish France could adopt a more humble attitude, show more respect for its partners and the EU's institutions, and view Europe as more than an extension of its own philosophy.
The war in Lebanon, so frustrating for Israel, accelerated that subtle change. Now Europe and its various contingents are playing a leading role in picking up the pieces there.
All these developments subtly indicate a deep trend that can be formalized in one sentence: America’s unipolar moment, which began in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Empire, is over.
The world in which we live may be moving toward the multi-polarity wished for by French President Jacques Chirac, but not necessarily in a successful and stable way.
Europe has a unique chance to demonstrate that it can make a difference in America’s post-unipolar moment.
The real reason to worry is that India has lost international competitiveness and has been buying time by borrowing from fickle lenders.
Infrastructure did not keep pace with the economy’s needs.
Amid weakening competitiveness, the rupee was propped up by increasingly unstable foreign sources of funds.
And the Indian government played a large part in fueling rupee appreciation by easing companies’ ability to borrow abroad.
To reclaim its promise, India must foster a new generation of productivity growth.
Moreover, they knew that, in contrast to the inter-war period, close international coordination would be needed.
The fact that many Western economies got out of recession last year should not fool us into thinking that the crisis was only a brief interlude, and that the post-crisis world can return to the pre-crisis status quo.
By doling out vast sums of money to rescue the financial system, without asking for genuine guarantees in return, they showed a lack of foresight.
After all, export-led growth policies can succeed only if other countries are willing to run deficits.
As long as the system is corrupted from above, and as long as the only way common people can deal with the government is through bribery, says the report, inefficiency will reign and people will cheat each other.
He was afraid, he explained, that if he appointed new people they would start over in their depredations, putting a much heavier burden on Egypt.
The report maintains that these funds are often used to participate in illegal financial transactions, arms’ dealing, and money laundering.
The need for reform, it argues, is not based merely on a desire for better government or abstract rights, but is necessary to save a country that is being strangled.
But, while this seems more responsive than “no comment,” it says little about the course of current and future US government action.
Even with the dollar’s decline and the resulting 25% rise in US exports over the past two years, the US still had an annualized trade deficit at the end of fourth quarter of 2007 of about $700 billion (5% of GDP).
But when foreign investors don’t want to continue to hold dollar securities, their attempts to sell them will push down their value until the combination of reduced exposure and reduced fear of further dollar decline makes them willing to hold the outstanding stock of dollar securities.
Yet a new survey shows that Americans believe that the share of renewables in 2035 will be 30.2%.
The reality is that humanity has spent recent centuries getting away from renewables.
And there is one environmental benefit that is often overlooked: in 1910, more than 30% of farmland in the United States was used to produce fodder for horses and mules.
Yes, Denmark gets a record 34% of its electricity from wind. But electricity accounts for only 18% of its final energy use.
In the US, renewables accounted for 9.3% of energy production in 1949.
But if renewables were cheaper, they wouldn’t need subsidies, and we wouldn’t need climate policies.
Instead of believing in the Tooth Fairy, we should start investing in green R&D.
Consider the International Monetary Fund’s regular projections of world growth.
Faith in renewed growth is an ill-advised policy strategy.
Resumption of robust world economic growth is the basis for delaying the implementation of the Basel III bank rules.
AMSTERDAM – Competitiveness has become one of the economic buzzwords of our time.
Evergreen’s management cited the much higher government support available in China as its reason for the move.
A recent study by the Central Planning Bureau in the Netherlands shows that workers with a permanent contract receive more employer-funded training than workers with a temporary contract.
This has come at the expense of sectors that are more dependent on equity financing.
The freeze on $25 million of the leadership’s assets held at Banco Delta Asia in Macau has certainly irritated the North Koreans.
The Chinese can’t force Kim to disarm fully, but they can persuade him to negotiate with a now more flexible US.
It would also designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and impose further limits on exports to the country’s civil aviation industry.
Sanctions give lawmakers and diplomats plenty to talk about.
But at least it doesn’t tax poor countries, as rich-country imperialists did until well into the twentieth century.
As all but the most belligerent critics of US President George W Bush will acknowledge, America has taken an important lead in trying to make things marginally better.
In short, the fundamental problem with the debt-relief mantra is that it looks backward rather than forward.
It costs too much; it is inconvenient; and its environmental benefits are negligible (and, in some cases, non-existent).
No one should be surprised.
Moreover, the electricity required to charge an electric car is overwhelmingly produced with fossil fuels. Yes, it then emits about half the CO2 of a conventional car for every kilometer driven (using European electricity).
Purchasing a similar amount in the European Emissions Trading System would cost about €5.
Electric cars might be a great advance for that purpose in a couple of decades.
Private capital flows have exploded since, dwarfing trade in goods and services.
In fact, many emerging markets experienced declines in investment rates. Nor, on balance, has liberalization of capital flows stabilized consumption.
Behind this shortcoming lay various institutional and market distortions associated with industrial and other modern-sector activities in low-income environments.
But it is not impossible – as long as policymakers understand the critical role played by the exchange rate and the need to subordinate capital flows to the requirements of competitiveness.
Yes, over the last decade, there has been growing use of global governance standards, largely developed in the United States, to assess how countries and companies around the world protect minority investors. But these efforts have overlooked fundamental differences between controlled companies, which have a controlling shareholder, and widely held firms that lack such a controller.
Investors and public officials in countries where controlled companies dominate should stop using global governance standards based on the designers’ experience with widely held firms in the US.
They should focus on the special problems of controlled companies and on the rules that would work best for protecting smaller investors in such companies.
Deploying more wind turbines and solar panels creates a need for more builders, technicians, tradespeople, and specialist employees.
But the biggest problem in these analyses is that they often fail to recognize the higher costs or job losses that these policies will cause.
In addition to job creation, some researchers have blithely claimed that all sorts of other economic benefits will accrue from investment in alternative energy, including increased productivity, higher disposable incomes, and lower operating costs for businesses.
These programs were fine, the argument goes, for the industrial economy of the Great Depression and the post-World War II generation, but they have become obsolete in today’s high-tech, networked, post-industrial economy.
One reason is that companies nowadays are much more aware of their own long-run fragility than they were in the post-World War II decades.
Workers and other asset holders place a very high value on safety, security, and predictability, so a defined-benefit pension plan is extremely valuable.
The reality is far more complex, of course.
Others around the world similarly oppose regulatory institutions, but for very different reasons.
Day-to-day politics cannot dominate the regulation that markets need.
SOFIA – One of the most troubling outcomes of the ongoing financial crisis has been a collapse of trust in democratic institutions and politicians.
On the contrary, as soon as government information is designed to be immediately open to everybody, its value as information declines and its value as an instrument of manipulation increases.
Moreover, information never comes without interpretation.
But, in a regime like Vladimir Putin’s, where the government decides who may be a candidate, the webcams would be farcical were they not also so intimidating.
Rather than restoring trust in democratic institutions, the transparency movement could accelerate the transformation of democratic politics into the management of mistrust.
For the last 12 years, the Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by 2015 has been the driving force for hunger reduction.
Indeed, the FAO was created in 1945 to bring about a world in which there would be “freedom from want,” which, in the words of its founders, “means the conquest of hunger and the attainment of the ordinary needs of a decent, self-respecting life.”
The Fatal Myth of a Drug-Free World
But there is reason for hope.
A Death in Galway
Halappanavar died from septicemia, which her family is certain would not have developed if the termination had been carried out.
As I noted almost 20 years ago, the Western Christian/Catholic view of abortion is not the only religious interpretation of the issue.
Such a global dialogue initiated in “the East” would not be unique.
Ethnocentrism is bound to distort a people’s relations with the rest of the world, and Israel’s doctrine of power was drawn from the depths of Jewish experience, particularly the eternal, unforgiving hostility of a Gentile world.
Israel’s lightning victory &#160;recalls Hegel’s dictum about “the impotence of the winners.”
In fact, Israel materialized because historical and political conditions favored it, and because Zionist diplomacy successfully navigated the international-relations challenges that it encountered.
Indeed, international acquiescence to the situation created by Israel’s victory in 1967 proved to be extremely short-lived.
In such circumstances, seemingly small events can trigger an unforeseen and disastrous chain reaction. 
America is clearly concerned.
But, given the danger of incidents that could grow out of political competition in Taiwan or growing impatience in the Peoples’ Liberation Army on the mainland, the US would be wise to encourage more active contacts and negotiations by the two sides.
If the overall climate is one of distrust, what looks like a hedge to one side can look like a threat to the other.
While some are supporting additional stimulus, others are calling for UK-style austerity.
I am heartened by calls for this in the UK, and that the talk is now turning to the purchase of risky assets, such as corporate bonds or bundles of loans to the private sector, as opposed to long-term government securities.
The 2008 recession was triggered by the collapse of a real-estate bubble.
Quantitative easing works by increasing the value of wealth.
Men report handling of their testicles and penises, TSA officials are instructed to open and peer down waistbands, and YouTube is now rife with videos of frightened children being – to describe it accurately – sexually molested, though this is the last thing most TSA officials wish to do.
And children will be placed most at risk of profound negative effects.
Shortly after former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff made the rounds of TV shows arguing in favor of such measures to thwart “bad guys,” one of his consulting firm’s clients, Rapiscan, won the $350 million contract to provide the full-body x-ray machines.
Maintaining these profits requires a population conditioned by this theater of fear to submit to anything – even the sexual quasi-abuse of themselves and their children.
Fear of terrorism is only one segment of what might best be described as a multi-level structure of dread.
In the aftermath of World War II, a group of idealistic Frenchmen bent on reconciliation with their former enemy declared that France would have “the Germany she deserved.”
The Fed vs. the Financiers
Greenspan listened patiently and quietly to Bernanke’s logic.
The problem is worse in most other countries.
But then he sheepishly adds that if his wife is not happy, he cannot be happy.
Bernanke had also supported the low-interest-rate policy implemented after the dot-com collapse, which, in the view of many economists, was maintained for too long, fueling the boom and contributing to the bust.
Politicians acknowledge, in their more rational moments (yes, they have them), that they can’t be trusted with the interest-rate weapon, especially as an election approaches.
The problem is how to establish two different types of accountability for two different functions.
President Obama should not draw the conclusion that arguments about the Fed’s accountability have gone away with Bernanke’s confirmation.
Even the periphery of the eurozone is benefiting from the wall of liquidity unleashed by the Fed, the Bank of Japan, and other major central banks.
The weak real economy and job market, together with high debt ratios, suggest the need to exit monetary stimulus slowly.
The exit from the Fed’s QE and zero-interest-rate policies will be treacherous: Exiting too fast will crash the real economy, while exiting too slowly will first create a huge bubble and then crash the financial system.
And, having played a central role in creating the current mess, it is now trying to regain face.&nbsp;
So, while bringing down short-term T-bill rates to near zero has failed, the hope is that bringing down longer-term interest rates will spur the economy.
It may help, though, in two ways.
So QE would produce some – probably weak – balance-sheet effects.
Today, many social conservatives still blame Friedan and feminism for inducing women to abandon the home for the workplace, thus destabilizing families and placing their children at risk.
The dramatic decrease in laws and customs perpetuating female subordination over the past 40 years has been closely connected to women’s expanded participation in paid employment.
In countries such as Japan, Italy, and Singapore, where the terms of marriage remain favorable to men, and women have a hard time combining work and family, working women postpone marriage and motherhood much longer than in the US, leading to declines in birth rates that threaten these societies’ future.
Far from being a threat to family life, the further progress of women’s rights may be our best hope for well-functioning families.
For example, recent data show that even a moderate deficiency of Vitamin A results in higher mortality.
Fighting malnutrition is the first step toward reaching this objective.
Despite a clear win for the center-right, the Christian Democrats (CDU) did not escape unscathed.
Merkel barely avoided political oblivion in the last general election, after the CDU had embraced market radicalism and then campaigned on it in 2005.
That said, governing will hardly be a cinch for Merkel.
The SPD, together with the Greens, will have to take the fight to the political center, which precludes competing with the Left for fringe voters.
The reason is simple: increasingly, people across Pakistan support the army’s action.
Leaders of the religious parties rushed to denounce Mohammad’s views.
In Pakistan, the democratic transition, after years of military rule, is still not complete.
Talibanization gains ground when people lose faith in the capacity of the modern state to improve their lives.
But, according to a recent and very convincing essay published in the magazine Foreign Affairs , a dual demographic and economic trend is taking place that will result in spectacular shifts by the middle of this century.
In a hasty and excessively provocative manner, some in the American media are starting to speak of Obama as “a second Jimmy Carter” and predict that he will serve only one term.
Europe must realize that it cannot be seen as a model for anyone if no one any longer takes it seriously as a global actor.
Non-financial companies could not get working capital, much less funding for long-term investments.
Sky-high oil and food prices added to the pain, and thus to the downturn.
Suppose that the government gives a tax cut in order to increase consumers’ take-home pay.
Moreover, concerns about the enormous US budget deficit, now running at $1.8 trillion (12% of GNP) per year, are bound to increase, not only creating enormous uncertainties in politics and financial markets, but also dimming consumer confidence as households focus their attention on potential future budget cuts and tax increases.
Doing so would add to the global recovery, improve long-term environmental sustainability, and accelerate economic development.
The facts have shown the opposite to be true.
The recent decision of Standard and Poor’s to lower Argentina’s rating is fully justified and reflects many analysts’ fear that Argentina will again default on its public debt.
President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva did indeed decide to avoid the rampant populism of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, and successfully tackled inflation. But it takes more than that to become a great economic power.
Almost nobody, however, understands that today's chaos was made in Washington - deliberately, cynically, and steadfastly.
Attacks on Aristide began as soon as the Bush administration assumed office.
Hopes were high that he would deliver progress against the extraordinary poverty.
He was, without doubt, the popularly elected leader of the country - a claim that George W. Bush cannot make about himself.
It is sad to hear rampaging students on BBC and CNN saying that Aristide "lied" because he didn't improve the country's social conditions.
Health care for the poor (Medicaid) is a shared responsibility.
The US Constitution knitted together the thirteen original colonies, and its Tenth Amendment reserves to the states all powers not expressly delegated to the federal government.
There are important differences among jurisdictions.
California is an example of long-run fiscal folly meeting short-run national and global economic crisis, resulting in chaos.
Now facing another $20 billion deficit despite temporary tax hikes and spending cuts, California’s fiscal woes foreshadow those of many sub-national – or, indeed, national –governments globally. While all must first deal with the current emergency, sensible local fiscal, tax, and political reforms are vital to restore a balance of centralized and decentralized government.
Syria’s implosion, and the chaos and extremism that are likely to breed there, will threaten the entire Middle East: the stability of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq, Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia hangs in the balance.
But, if US politicians spend the next two years the way they have spent the last two – patching together temporary policy fixes while avoiding the hard issues that voters and markets expect them to face – America’s voice will grow fainter, and weaker, in international institutions and affairs.
NATO allies could make a similar statement.
Moreover, UN analysts estimate that most of the additional troops will not arrive in Darfur until early next year.
Their preferred model calls for the UN to provide the funding and most other support for the mission, while allowing the AU to maintain its leadership role.
The UN Human Rights Committee has found that widespread and systematic human rights abuses extend throughout Sudan, not just Darfur. Foreign Policy magazine considers Sudan the country most at risk of state failure.
We have seen this principle in action since the early fall of 2007, as growing excess demand for safe, liquid, high-quality financial assets has carried with it growing excess supply for the goods and services that are the products of ongoing human labor.
When there is excess demand for safe, liquid, high-quality financial assets, the rule for which economic policy to pursue – if, that is, you want to avoid a deeper depression – has been well-established since 1825.
How much should they do? As long as there is a clear global excess supply of goods and services – as long as unemployment remains highly elevated and inflation rates are falling – they are not doing enough.
This is no ordinary academic debate. The controversy has spilled out of the psychology laboratories and psychiatric clinics, capturing headlines, motivating legislative changes, and affecting outcomes in civil lawsuits and criminal trials.
Ordinary forgetfulness that emerges after a trauma must not be confused with amnesia for the trauma.
In contrast, the phenomenon of dissociative amnesia supposedly entails victims’ inability to remember their traumatic experiences, not an inability to remember their entire lives or who they are.
Failing to understand what had happened to them, they simply did not think about it for many years.
Pakistan was created by the partition of British India in 1947, but its territory was divided into two enclaves separated by hundreds of miles.
This was not palatable to the Punjabi-dominated military brass or to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the leader of West Pakistan’s largest political party.
Time magazine’s August 2, 1971, issue quoted a United States official saying, “This is the most incredible, calculated thing since the days of the Nazis in Poland.”
He would even send the US Seventh Fleet to cow her.
It is as if the Nuremberg trials never happened after WWII.
What is even more insulting to African women is that the AU bypassed them to pick men whose commitment to democracy and human rights may be worse than that of Laurent Gbagbo, the man clinging to the Ivorian presidency despite losing the election.
I know that many would argue that the pool of well-known African women is limited to Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Nobel Peace Laureate Wangari Maathai, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the former Nigerian minister of finance and current World Bank vice president, Graça Machel, the former First Lady of Mozambique and South Africa, and a few others.
A woman wouldn't have said to Gbagbo, “Step down or face war.”
We need, therefore, to revisit today’s global challenges from a Third-World perspective.
If we are to close the global gap in personal security and economic well-being, the community of nations will need to cultivate a new ethos of mutual responsibility.
Above all, those who lead us today must create a genuinely new global order in which all peoples take part – with dignity and an assurance of fairness.
The world is on a slippery slope toward nationalism and exclusion.
Most economists stress the superiority of the free-trade model and point to the power of lobbies and interest groups to explain its unpopularity in practice.
One reason that free trade defeated protectionism in Britain a century ago was that its supporters appealed to people’s emotions and identities, not just their rational interest in more wealth and cheap food.
Political institutions needed to catch up.
History shows that doing so is both possible and necessary.
As a result, Palestinian politics has degenerated into a naked struggle for the spoils of power.
Tragically, all this is not only about human victims, but also about the Palestinians’ political horizon.
Only a dramatic move by external powers can still save Gaza from becoming a second Mogadishu and both Palestinians and Israelis from a total war that would only breed more rage and desperation.
A contour map of economic activity in the world would show mountains of prosperity and many ravines of deprivation.
But Keynes’s Englishman was wealthy and thus exceptional.
But flattening is reversible.
While the American and Chinese economies are highly interdependent today, so, too, were Germany and Britain before 1914.
As the world’s largest economy, the US has taken the lead in promoting policies that reduce barriers. But the events described above could reverse such policies.
While the euro has not caused France’s economic problems, its politicians’ commitment to the single currency represents an insurmountable barrier to solving them.
The current election campaign is accordingly centered on France’s fiscal position.
So the budget deficit will persist, and more retrenchment will be required.
But that was possible not because of Mitterrand’s superior wiles, but rather because France had a stronger position vis à vis Germany than it does today.

Indeed, for France’s political leaders, business amounts to a zero-sum competition to capture a higher share of total value added for owners and managers, at the expense of labor.
Now, citizens are facing higher taxes and cuts to public services.
Furthermore, companies will not receive the cash until 2014-2015, owing to the complexity of France’s tax administration.
Yet, according to all public-opinion polls, close to 70% of the French support the demonstrators who are taking to the streets to block the very modest reforms introduced by President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government.
The protesters know that what they are demanding in the streets today – the maintenance of what they have – is totally unrealistic.
Indeed, Sarkozy’s personal unpopularity plays a significant role in the continuing strength of the anti-reform opposition.
In all fairness, it seems easier to explain than to understand their behavior.
To be sure, France has been severely hit by the global financial crisis and economic downturn.
France urgently needs structural reforms – and thus a strong government.
This deep pessimism militates against any public debate or reform, and exaggerates the importance of the current political crisis.
Balancing cuts in public spending in order not to endanger growth and employment requires a stable and smart government – and time.
So don’t bury France just yet.
In some cases, grid expansion makes sense after removing these distortions.
The monthly leasing cost of the 20-watt panel in question, when stretched over 10 years, can be as little as $1.60.
Governments can choose household-level technologies or village-level micro-grids; involve aid donors or use other modes of financing; offer subsidies to encourage private entrepreneurs or energy-service concessions to existing utilities; lease the equipment by providing consumer credit or sell it up front.
The first is safety; the second is radiation.
Indeed, nuclear energy is a safer proposition now than ever before, but, for many people, the mere spectacle of an event like Fukushima – regardless of the outcome – is sufficient to draw the opposite conclusion. If a 747 crashed into a nuclear facility, we would be unlikely to hear calls for all airplanes to be outlawed, but the clamor for every reactor on the planet to be shut down immediately would probably be deafening.
Currently, there is too much “I know” and “This is what I firmly believe,” frequently from influential people, in cases where there is no incontestable right or wrong. Fukushima is one of them.
But Europe’s track record does not inspire confidence that the next round of tests will be much more rigorous than the last.
First, the new bonds could be structured so that haircuts incurred by the banks count as tax losses, reducing the hit to their profits.
The equivalent for Greece would be to index payments to its rate of GDP growth, thereby automatically adjusting Greece’s debt burden to its payment capacity.
Nor does it matter that Chávez’s handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, has already assumed the presidency. All of the signs point to the decline of Chávismo and to the end of Venezuela’s role as Latin America’s populist core.
Moreover, it will not be easy for Cuba to find a new leader to champion its absolutist ideology across Latin America.
Given this, Maduro cannot leave any issues unacknowledged or blame them on his predecessor. At the same time, it will be difficult to address Venezuela’s problems effectively without Chávez’s electoral support, rhetorical talent, and charisma.
The report is the result of a longstanding China-World Bank partnership.
Finally, farmers’ rights need to be protected, the efficiency of land use must be increased, and policies for acquisition of rural land for urban use should be overhauled.
Last but not least, China should become a proactive stakeholder in the global economy.
They seem condemned by their heavy debt burdens to years of stagnation or slow growth, widening inequality, and possible social strife.
The decade preceding the global financial crisis was in many ways the best ever for the developing world.
Even unambiguously successful cases have been subject to conflicting interpretations.
Growth that relies on capital inflows or commodity booms tends to be short-lived.
The Future of Europe

And now the recent financial crisis has exposed the limits of fiscal integration in the eurozone and raised questions about the role and future of the euro.

All who admire the European experiment must hope that they succeed.
Was his claim that revenues had grown for the last five years true merely because of acquisitions that his company had made?
In other words, Russians looked only for the agenda, the motivation behind the assertion. The actual truth was irrelevant.
Why is this politician saying nice things about that politician? What company does the product reviewer work for?
WARWICK – The just-concluded French presidential election seemed to suggest that the old left-right divisions are as potent as they have ever been – and certainly in their birthplace.
The precautionary principle is the better known of the two, and increasingly figures in environmental and health legislation.
A precautionary firm would look like a miniature version of today’s regulatory state, whereas a proactionary state would operate like a venture capitalist writ large.
In the future, I suggest, the traditionalists and the communitarians will form the precautionary pole of the political spectrum, while the libertarians and technocrats will form the proactionary pole.
Consider the development of online search in the broadest terms.
The challenge of course, is that each kind of product has a different structure and a different set of attributes.
Powerset, a tool for creating and defining such relationships in any sphere of interest, is broader but less deep.
Then, last month, Google acquired Metaweb and its user-generated database Freebase.
CAMBRIDGE – Global government is unlikely in the twenty-first century, but various degrees of global governance already exist.
Today, as a universal institution, the UN plays a crucial role in legitimization, crisis diplomacy, peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions, but its very size has proven to be a disadvantage for many other functions.
But the dollar’s global pre-eminence was the crucial feature of monetary cooperation until the 1970’s.
That is why, on issues like climate change, the UN will continue to play a role, but more intensive negotiations are likely to occur in smaller groups such as the Major Economies Forum, where fewer than a dozen countries account for 80% of greenhouse gas emissions.
CAMBRIDGE – American economic policy aims for a dollar that is strong at home and competitive abroad.
In recent years, countries around the world have accumulated very large volumes of foreign exchange, topped by China with more than $2 trillion, but including hundreds of billions of dollars held by Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, India, and the oil-producing countries.
The major risk to the sustained role of the dollar is the large and growing US national debt.
The best protection of the dollar’s future role – and of the health of the US economy – will be policies that reduce the growth of the national debt.
Even if Japan implemented them, they would still not equal the capacity of the US or eliminate the asymmetry.
To be sure, measured by official exchange rates, China is the world’s fourth largest economy, and it is growing at 10% annually. But China’s income per capita is only 4% that of the US.
By reinforcing their alliance, the US and Japan can hedge against uncertainty while at the same time offering China integration into global institutions as a “responsible stakeholder.”
The Rise of the Robots
Recently, automation in manufacturing has expanded even to areas where labor has been relatively cheap.
Translation, data analysis, legal research – a whole range of high-skilled jobs may wither away.
What is noticeable, though, is that structural unemployment – the unemployment that remains even after economies have recovered – has been on an upward trend over the last 25 years.
With our post-machine standard of living, we can afford to shed some of the Puritan guilt that has, for centuries, kept our noses to the grindstone.
The G-20’s Empty Promises
That will be particularly challenging for Bernanke.
Such large fiscal deficits would mean that the government must borrow funds that would otherwise be available for private businesses to finance investment in productivity-enhancing plant and equipment.
I hope that the other G-20 leaders do a better job of reining in their budgets.
Not only was it located in one, but, in many ways, it was also dominated by them.
Even sub-Saharan Africa, the traditional laggard, is expected to grow at 5% in 2010.
Their answer was straightforward: the crisis began with US over-borrowing, so it is America’s responsibility, not theirs, to clean up the mess.
The G-20 rightly decided to focus on those areas of the global development agenda where the major economies have a comparative advantage: financing of infrastructure such as roads and power; business development; and support for agricultural upgrading in the poorer countries.
By channeling the savings of China, Germany, Japan, and other surplus countries into infrastructure investments in the poor countries, the world’s economies truly would be working in harmony.
Soon after this, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced “years of pain ahead,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel outlined a $100bn retrenchment plan, and French Prime Minister François Fillon a similar $80bn plan. .
More importantly, increasingly nervous bond markets will at some point start questioning the sustainability of US public finances.
Four consequences are likely.
The Millennium Development Goals are the world’s agreed goals to cut poverty, hunger, and disease.
The point was clear.
It shows the nature of discussions at the highest reaches of the G-8.
Moreover, unlike in 2005, the G-8 needs to present a plan of action.
Fortunately, what needs to be done is not complicated.
In the past, top North Korean leaders tended to calculate carefully the costs and benefits when they acted to put pressure on the outside world.
They seem to believe that possession of nuclear weapons provides them with far wider room for strategic and tactical boldness.
But, compared to the more fundamental factors discussed above, I believe that this is probably a secondary motive for the attack on the Cheonan.
So far, the international community has focused mainly on the immediate concern of denuclearizing North Korea.
Since then, their membership has multiplied.
Part of the problem lies in how Central American governments confront the phenomena.
Instead of articulating policies to return fundamental rights to the region’s young people, Central American governments are preparing to wage war against gangs in the name of national security.
But the outlook for a new, sensible policy is not promising.
This is much of what passes for industry in Gaza.
Hamas won the 2006 elections in the whole of occupied Palestine and formed a national unity government with Fatah.
Most of that has been stamped out.
But the Gaza blockade means that Israel boycotts Palestinian academic life.
The Gazpromization of European Energy Security
Indeed, the Putin administration established a track record of bending rules and bullying foreign investors, with the support of prosecutors, tax authorities, regulatory agencies, and courts.
In exchange for gas deals with rival suppliers, such as Algeria, Russia has offered vast concessions on arms and preferential debt terms.
The lights must not go out across Europe.
Moreover, fundamental threats to the food and water supply – especially food in the tropics and water in the subtropics – are coming if we continue business as usual.
One, carbon dioxide reduction (CDR), involves removing from the atmosphere the main gas that is causing global warming.
What if Russia and Canada wanted Earth to be warmer, and sinking islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific want it to be cooler?
The Geopolitical Consequences of the Financial Crisis

In a financial system that has become so demented, only institutions with more or less infinite resources can stem the tide.  Such institutions can conceivably be self-help organizations, such as pools of powerful banks.  The US Treasury indeed tried to put together such a pool on Sunday, September 14th. 

Of course, the Western powers must be applauded for their efforts, with the support of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, to prevent a slaughter of Libya’s civilian population.
The rise of authoritarian capitalism – best symbolized by China, but also embraced by countries as disparate as Malaysia, Singapore, Kazakhstan, and Qatar – has created a new model that competes with (and challenges) liberal democracy.
In response to calls by some overseas Chinese for people to gather on Sundays at specific sites in Shanghai and Beijing to help launch a molihua (jasmine) revolution, China has revealed a new strategy: preemptively flood the protest-designated squares with police to leave no room for protesters.
But Barack Obama’s administration apparently has concluded that Arab monarchs are likely to survive, whereas Arab presidents are more likely to fall, and that it is acceptable for the United States to continue to coddle tyrannical kings.
And, in fact, real war has actually broken out over football.
France and Germany will soon have a common army – they already have a common currency – yet the survival of national teams channels, within a strictly limited framework, lingering rivalry between the two countries.
Perhaps one day it will take place.
But I want France to avenge its defeat at the last World Cup in Seville, not its defeat at Verdun.

Using monthly Sampamp;P Composite data, the 38% increase from March to September was the second-largest six-month increase since 1871, surpassed only by a 71% increase from February to August 1933, during the Great Depression. This rebound is all the more remarkable given that it followed the second-largest six-month decrease ever, as stock prices fell 38% from September 2008 to March 2009.
Anger at these profits and bonuses only tends to increase the contagion of the story.
The clamor by disaffected politicians and human rights activists for such a conference had reached a crescendo.
But the most powerful push for the conference came from politicians in the largely Christian south, apprehensive that power would return to the Muslim north in 2007 after Obasanjo, himself a southern Christian, completed his second term.
There will be 400 delegates, but the bulk of them nominated by the president and his party, and the government-controlled National Assembly will vet their proposals.
The death of General Augusto Pinochet, Chile’s former military dictator, provides perhaps an appropriate end for a year that saw the Latin American left return to glory, a revival that Hugo Chavez’s overwhelming reelection in Venezuela is but the strongest sign.
His only ideology nowadays is Daniel Ortega.
The Latin American left does not share George W. Bush’s view of the world.
If the new left does not manage to answer these questions satisfactorily, it will be seen as having failed.
The Ghosts of Summits Past
Monetary experts argued that an agreement on currency stabilization would be highly desirable, but that it required a prior agreement on the dismantling of trade barriers – all the high tariffs and quotas that had been introduced in the course of the depression.
Germany’s president had just appointed Adolf Hitler’s radical and aggressive government.
Everyone pretended to be shocked at the failure of internationalism. But, at the same time, they were delighted to have found someone who could be blamed for the failure of the conference.
Failure at today’s London conference is also likely to be used as a rhetorical weapon against the large Western governments, and to provide a rationale for implementing new forms of state capitalism.
The secular establishment argues that the AKP’s moderation thus far reflects the checks and balances implied by secularist control of the presidency.
Now opponents of Turkey’s EU accession bid have seized upon recent events to argue that the country does not meet the democratic standards necessary for full membership.
But Turkey has the potential to show the shallowness of such a scenario by demonstrating the compatibility of liberal democracy and Islam.
The decision came only three months after the company abandoned investment in two new units in North Carolina.
But, since the March 2011 triple-meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant, the pace of the decline has accelerated significantly.
Whether the other projects, all of which have been initiated in the past five years, are on schedule remains to be seen.
As a result, the price per installed solar kilowatt has dropped by three-quarters over the last seven years.
After all, no economy can raise living standards forever through innovations that make production of existing goods more efficient.
Virtually all the toys and shoes sold in the US are made in the Far East. China alone accounts for 86% of the US bicycle market.
Moreover, exports to low-wage countries cannot compensate for job losses.
Standard supply-side arguments fare no better.
But if this capacity is impaired, neither the low road of protection nor the high road of free trade can do much good.
In addition to explicit protectionist measures, governments now plan actions that will affect others across the globe.
First, the frequency of meetings should be increased, especially in times of crisis, and the level of a few of these meetings enhanced.
Industrial countries should be happy that developing countries would take greater responsibility for global economic outcomes, rather than simply sulking about their lack of voice and representation.
In the banking world as a whole, expected write-offs now considerably exceed the €400 billion mark projected just last spring.
This has dispelled hopes that Asia economic activity could develop separately from that of the US, thereby offsetting European exporters’ losses in America.
In the second quarter, the German economy shrank at an annualized, seasonally and calendar adjusted rate of 2%.

So it is no surprise that central banks have become increasingly desperate in the face of the most severe crisis since the advent of financial globalization.
To mitigate the effects of a US recession and global economic slump, the Fed and other central banks should be cutting rates much more aggressively, rather than relying on modest liquidity injections that are bound to fail. The Fed’s 25-basis-point cut in December was puny relative to what is needed; similar cuts by the Bank of England and Bank of Canada do not even begin to address the increase in nominal and real borrowing rates that the sharp rise in Libor rates has induced.
So the risk of something equivalent to a bank run for non-bank financial institutions, owing to their short-term liabilities and longer-term and illiquid assets, is rising – as recent runs on some banks (Northern Rock), money market funds, state investment funds, distressed hedge funds suggests.
But fiscal austerity will envelop most advanced economies this year, rather than just the eurozone periphery and the United Kingdom.
Second, while the ECB’s actions have reduced tail risks in the eurozone – a Greek exit and/or loss of market access for Italy and Spain – the monetary union’s fundamental problems have not been resolved.
Their “state capitalism” – a large role for state-owned companies; an even larger role for state-owned banks; resource nationalism; import-substitution industrialization; and financial protectionism and controls on foreign direct investment – is the heart of the problem.
As 2013 begins, the downside risks to the global economy are gathering force.
The US budget deficit has been on a downward trend for now, helped by both higher revenues and lower pressure on spending (for example, payments to the unemployed have fallen as joblessness has declined).
Pushed further away from best-case scenarios, they are unable to ignore the global liquidity impact of the Fed’s policies, yet they lack the right policy tools to address it.
The other road is a lot less attractive. With insufficient endogenous healing and no economic escape velocity, the effectiveness of central banks’ policies wanes and political dysfunction increases, leading to financial losses, volatility spikes, and huge risk-management challenges.
Homes are the most local of investments, rooted to a particular place like a tree, and thus thriving or withering in response to local economic conditions.
People in Tokyo will assume some of this risk by purchasing New York home price futures if the price is right.
After the CME’s announcement, one of its competitors, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said that it plans to create futures and options contracts on major US regions, to be based on the median home price published by the National Association of Realtors.
In fact, such adjustments in our thinking will likely occur when we actually see the futures market prices.
They were also revolutions of ideas – the globalization of protest as a strategy.
As Spain’s indignados sat in the squares, they felt for the first time connected to the people in their communities – a feeling that became a large part of why they stayed.
The immediate political results of this new connectivity are tenuous.
Yet his proposals are meeting strong opposition from fiscally conservative Democrats as well as from Republicans, owing to their potential impact on future fiscal deficits.
But, rather than producing a specific proposal, he left it to Congress to design the legislation.
Increasing the number of insured by 35 million and broadening protection for some who are now insured implies increased demand for health care, which could raise the cost of care paid for by the government as well as by private health-care buyers.
Surprisingly, the bond market still seems almost oblivious to this risk.
More specifically, the rising unemployment rate, along with the large number of employees on involuntary part-time work, has increased the number of people who cannot afford their monthly mortgage payments.
The rate of decline of US house prices fell in the past three months for which we have data (ending in May), and the figures for May show essentially no decline at all.
Foreclosed property is generally sold at auction, guaranteeing that there will be a buyer – but driving down prices.
Unless house prices have stopped declining, it is important for the Obama administration to turn to the problem of high loan-to-value ratios.
Amidst a crumbling economy, the country remains belligerent, using its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, to launch at least one successful drone flight above Israel and reportedly initiating recent cyber attacks.
Whereas extraction of America’s extensive reserves of natural gas was previously thought to be unfeasible, technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) have ushered in a shale-gas revolution.
Though nationalist sentiment directed against external foes tends to divert attention temporarily from internal turmoil, the country’s serious domestic problems need to be addressed.
The Kremlin continues to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, maintaining a strict aversion to military intervention and seeking to defend its strategic interests, including its naval base in the Syrian city of Tartus.
MELBOURNE – One spring evening in 1997, when I was a mental-health researcher at the Australian National University in Canberra, I was discussing with my wife, Betty Kitchener, a registered nurse who taught first-aid courses for the Red Cross in her spare time, the inadequacy of conventional first-aid training.
By 2005, it was operating across Australia and in Scotland and Hong Kong, and has since spread to more than 20 other countries.
This need is particularly pressing for those – such as parents, teachers, youth workers, and sports coaches – who are in regular contact with young people.
In developed and developing countries alike, the scope of the problem is too large to be left exclusively to mental-health professionals.
The US remains the global leader in R&amp;D investment, spending an estimated $400 billion in 2009 – a total boosted by President Barack Obama’s stimulus package, and higher than China, Japan, and Germany combined.
Throughout the world, the business sector remains both the predominant performer and the predominant funder of R&amp;D investment.
Many countries are also changing their immigration laws to make it easier to attract highly skilled workers, especially scientists and engineers, who are increasingly mobile.
The common currency is the canary in the mine of the global exchange-rate system.
When things did not work out globally, a regional solution might be possible.
What resulted was a partly flawed answer to the problem.
It will demand global coordination of monetary policies, and some form of global economic governance.
And, just as the inhuman terror attacks of September 11, 2001 severely damaged Islam’s credibility in many people’s eyes, the invasion of Iraq, which was based on lies, has damaged both Christianity and the Western community of values.
This Golden Rule, however, also appears in the Indian tradition.
Four concrete ethical rules were laid down in the Buddhist canon by Patanjali, the founder of Yoga, in the Chinese tradition and, of course, in the three prophetic religions: “Do not kill,” “do not steal,” “do not bear false witness,” and “do not abuse sexuality.”
If he is all-powerful, he could have created a world without so much of it – and he would have done so if he were all good.
The seventeenth-century French philosopher René Descartes solved it by the drastic expedient of denying that animals can suffer.
Next, D’Souza argued that since God gave us life, we are not in a position to complain if our life is not perfect.
If, however, we insist on believing in divine creation, we are forced to admit that the god who made the world cannot be all-powerful and all good.
As concerns about deflation replaced fear of inflation, gold prices started to fall with the correction in commodity prices.
Second, a massive wave of liquidity, via easy monetary policy, is chasing assets, including commodities, which may eventually stoke inflation further.
Eventually, central banks will need to exit quantitative easing and zero-interest rates, putting downward pressure on risky assets, including commodities.
CAMBRIDGE &#45;&#45; Lately, I have been trying to explain to my eleven-year-old son Gabriel the astronomical differences between people’s income.
Yes, I say. But if Bill Gates were to own the entire NBA, how would he decide which team to root for?
As for the other nine months, given that the US accounts for only 25% of world income, it is a fair guess that there are some very wealthy individuals elsewhere who might be able to kick in.
Policy solutions are not easy.
Gabriel says he is going to think about it.
Goldstone included in his report a detailed discussion of Hamas’s seizure of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and its refusal even to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to see him.
Only three have resulted in indictments.
The evidence available to him and to us about those investigations is clearly too paltry to warrant such a shift.
Signs of hope and progress abound.
Israel will not be able to ignore completely the rulings of either court.
I am also an investor in and advisor to AnchorFree, the company that offers Hotspot Shield, a publicly accessible virtual private network (VPN) that allows users to keep their browsing private, whether they are concerned about thieves stealing their banking details or about governments monitoring where they surf.
China employs approximately 30,000 people as censors.
Baidu, the indigenous Chinese rival to Google, benefits in many ways both from government support and from home-team nationalism among users.
Nor is China likely to say, “We weren’t hacking you…and we promise never to do it again.”
So someone in the Chinese government is probably having regrets.
Carnegie argued that those who thrive in business and acquire huge personal fortunes are better at judging how the world really works, and thus are better qualified to judge where resources should be directed.
Useful traits in business, like aggressiveness or political savvy, might be poorly suited to philanthropy. Likewise, running a foundation may well require studying social problems or the arts and sciences – activities that may not accord with former capitalists’ inclinations and talents.
However, 1% of GDP is still not a very big number, and the Gates Foundation, with about $60 billion after Buffett’s bequest, now accounts for a substantial share of the total.
We see two components to such a strategy.
But the magnitude of the challenges confronting Europe implies an urgent need for far more decisive reforms.
But the world expects the G-20 to deliver.
Since every dollar, euro, yen, rupee, or yuan borrowed today requires the same present value in future interest payments – and therefore future taxes – there are important long-term costs to balance against whatever benefits the deficits create today; there is no fiscal free lunch.
The current US stimulus has been much slower to enter the economy than promised.
Deficits are riskier if the level of the national debt, the accumulation of all previous deficits, is high or rapidly rising relative to GDP.
NEW HAVEN – In September 1998, during the depths of the Asian financial crisis, Alan Greenspan, the United States Federal Reserve’s chairman at the time, had a simple message: the US is not an oasis of prosperity in an otherwise struggling world.
Not surprisingly, Asia led the way, accounting for 33% of the total US export surge over the past three years.
That suggests that most of America’s European export gain was concentrated in the region’s so-called peripheral economies.
All of this underscores one of the more obvious, yet overlooked, implications of an increasingly interdependent world: we are all in it together.
America’s growth mirage is an important case in point.
But who are all those people wildly cheering for the billionaire’s dream, on of all days the anniversary of Martin Luther King’s speech? They are almost uniformly white, largely middle-aged and above, and for the most part far from wealthy.
Populism everywhere is driven by fear and resentment: fear of being powerless, without status or privilege, and resentment of those – educated liberal elites, foreigners who supposedly take our jobs, and Muslims, Jews, blacks, or illegal immigrants – who seem to enjoy undeserved benefits.
This is the myth of the US, the God-blessed land of the free.
Franklin D. Roosevelt knew how to inspire the patriotism of working men.
At one time the benevolent affections embrace merely the family, soon the circle expanding includes first a class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings of man with the animal world...
There is no sound moral reason why possession of basic rights should be limited to members of a particular species.
They display a sense of justice, resenting others who do not reciprocate a favor.
Thus, there is no European medical research currently being conducted on great apes, and one barrier to granting them some basic rights has collapsed.
NEW YORK – For the American economy – and for many other developed economies – the elephant in the room is the amount of money paid to bankers over the last five years.
In order to rescue the banking system, the Federal Reserve, for example, put interest rates at artificially low levels; as was disclosed recently, it also has provided secret loans of $1.2 trillion to banks.
But the puzzle represents an even bigger elephant.
We don’t believe that regulation is a panacea for this state of affairs.
They are right – up to a point: immediately after a normal recession, economies do, indeed, often grow much faster than usual over the ensuing twelve months.
The optimists say not to worry. Credit will soon come to everyone else as easily as it has to the banks.
But here’s the rub: financial regulation is enormously complicated, all the more so given that there must be some degree of international consistency.
But if regulation is too soft, the next monster global financial crisis could come within a decade.
PRINCETON – Whenever today’s economic crisis is discussed, analogies to the Great Depression are never far away.
First, no one has ever been able to explain satisfactorily the October 1929 market collapse in terms of a rational cause, with market participants reacting to a specific news event.
Intrinsic vulnerability made for heightened exposure to political shocks, and disputes about a Central European customs union and about war reparations was enough to topple a house of cards.
That dependence is analogous to the way in which money from emerging economies, mostly in Asia, flowed into the US in the 2000’s, when an apparent economic miracle was based on China’s willingness to lend.
According to computations by the economist Paul van den Noord, the net result of the 1937 budget was a fiscal contraction amounting to three percentage points of GDP – certainly not a trivial amount.
A particularly telling example is the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century, when a string of exhausted states defaulted on their obligations.
Indeed, central bankers and ministers were obsessed at the time by the memory of the 1930’s, and they consciously did the opposite of what their predecessors did 80 years ago.
But an undisciplined appeal to history risks becoming a confusing way to express opinions.
One of America’s last competitive cultural exports, it seems, is the post-adolescent male escape fantasy.
Nor does Japanese pop culture manufacture escape fantasies aimed at Japanese men.
To the rest of the world, those same qualities are part of his charm only so long as he stays safely up on the screen.
An editorial assistant at the New York Times, Zhao Jing, writing under the pen name Michael Anti, broke the news on his widely read Chinese-language blog.
Human rights activists in the United States are calling for legislation that would prevent American companies from engaging in business practices that help repressive regimes stifle democratic movements.
Naturally, the Chinese companies that provide most of the tools used to create and host this content have censorship built into their software, management structure, and business models.
NEW DELHI – Two “great games” currently roil South Asia.
Instead of an expansionist Russian empire confronting Imperial Britain, it is now a China hungry for land, water, and raw materials that is flexing its muscles, encroaching on Himalayan redoubts and directly challenging India.
The road, after all, is a vital link in China’s quest for direct access to the Arabian Sea.
The Great Global Bargain Hunt
Their share of “international responsibility” was revealed at the recent summit: contributions to the IMF of $43 billion by China, $10 billion by Brazil, Russia, and India, and $2 billion by South Africa.
Already, the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO) has obtained a 35-year lease to operate the second pier at the port of Piraeus, one of the busiest in the world, for €3.5 billion, and has purchased a truck-loading facility and packaging center in the Piraeus suburbs.
As governments and citizens around the world become aware of the influence that China can buy with its deep pockets, is an anti-Chinese backlash inevitable? Or have some countries been so scarred by the financial crisis that they don’t care where their next meal ticket comes from?
Indeed, such major carmakers as Toyota, Honda, Daimler, General Motors, and Hyundai/Kia are deep into plans for commercial production of cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells.
As for hydrogen fuel costs, there are currently no fixed numbers, but the US target is $2-3 per kilogram by around 2018 (a kilogram of hydrogen has about the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline).
Countless laboratories are working on better, cheaper hydrogen production and storage methods, and on ways to bring down costs and boost fuel cell durability.
Angell's argument was simple: in all prolonged modern industrial wars, everybody loses.
He was, of course, right in his judgment that the only way to prevent any modern industrial war from becoming a destructive tragedy for all was to quickly conclude a ceasefire.
From the pro-consulate of Julius Caesar until 1945, there was most likely at least one army crossing or about to cross or thinking of crossing the Rhine in arms.
If so, there is a chance that the globalized economic age to which we look forward will be a more peaceful age than the twentieth century was.
This vindicated criticism by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, among others, who had already begun to argue that the Phillips curve represented merely a short-term relationship.
That prospect has already sparked renewed financial-market volatility.
Sustaining a high budget deficit over many years will lead to an unmanageable debt buildup, unless that debt is inflated away or restructured.
But if, as seems likely, such devaluations are left too late, debt restructuring might still be needed.
The first concerns the complexity and vulnerability of our world.
With the world becoming a global stage, the media’s role in fueling the appetite for providential leaders is essential.
He alone seemed to incarnate the combination of reassuring strength and vision to carry the majority of Israelis behind him in a process of unilateral disengagement.
The years since then have seen the fastest global average income growth rate of any generation, as well as remarkably few outbreaks of mass unemployment-causing deflation or wealth-destroying inflation.
Europe's fixed exchange rate mechanism collapsed in 1992.
One year, they might seek to control inflation, but the previous year they sought to reduce unemployment, and next year they might try to lower the government’s debt refinancing costs, and the year after that they might worry about keeping the exchange rate at whatever value their political masters prefer.
Nor do I see any evidence at all in favor of the third explanation.
The euro was created partly in order to bolster internal market efficiency and prevent currency volatility.
Companies and investors exposed to risk in Europe must assume much more volatility in interest rates within the euro zone and increasingly uneven growth and inflation prospects.
No one believes that Germany is at risk of default, but investors overlook this sort of policy shift at their own risk.
The volume of Greece’s foreign debt has been reduced by more than €100 billion ($130 billion).
To reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 70%, Greece would have to maintain an average primary surplus of 4% for the next 30 years, a level that it has temporarily achieved in only four of the last 25 years.&nbsp;
But, while private-sector losses have been minimized, at what price? Had Greece defaulted on its debt in 2010, imposing the same “haircut” on private creditors as it has imposed now, it would have reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio to a more manageable 80%.
The Green Guevara’s
Whichever man wins will face Bolivia’s seemingly intractable pair of ills: social-exclusion and poverty.
Bolivia’s track record is remarkable: the world’s first debt-for-nature swap; the world’s largest protected dry tropical forest; experimental Indian park management; a rapidly growing protected-areas system; a National Environmental Fund; a world leader in international efforts to protect the endangered vicuna; progressive forestry legislation; a national biodiversity conservation agency; and a total ban on trade in domestic species.
The Green Inquisition

In June, Hansen proclaimed that people who spread “disinformation” about global warming – CEOs, politicians, in fact anyone who doesn’t follow Hansen’s narrow definition of the “truth” – should literally be tried for crimes against humanity.
But the globe’s real problem is not a series of inconvenient facts. It is that we have blocked out sensible solutions through an alarmist panic, leading to bad policies.
Because of climate panic, our attempts to mitigate climate change have provoked an unmitigated disaster.
But, while the compromise is more than could have been hoped for at the outset, several important countries did not partake of it.
The sacrifices of the participating countries would alleviate the CO2 problem only if their restraint meant that some of the fossil resources they do not consume remain underground.
They will therefore speed up rather than reduce production, in order to avoid selling their oil when anxiety about CO2 peaks and the artificial measures of the signing countries to reduce their consumption have dampened the oil price most.
The bad news is that this is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future, and that the owners of natural resources will therefore make every attempt to extract their resources and thus pump the fossil carbon into the atmosphere before the UN finds a way out of this impasse.
But billions of dollars in tax subsidies would create plenty of new jobs in almost any sector: the point is that many less capital-intensive sectors would create many more jobs for a given investment of taxpayers’ money.
If they were, we wouldn’t need to subsidize them.
Finally, it is often claimed that high CO2 taxes and subsidies for green technology will actually do good, and again Denmark is often taken as an example. After all, it is argued, Denmark has kept its CO2 emissions flat while enjoying 70% economic growth since 1981.
NAIROBI – In just two years, the idea of a “Green Economy,” with its links to sustainable development and poverty eradication, has gone from being an interesting idea to being among the top two issues at the upcoming UN Conference on Sustainable Development, or Rio+20.
None of this has come about by chance.
Multibillion-dollar investments also flowed into new wind farms, geothermal plants, and a host of other renewable-energy technologies.
The Greening of Bush
America’s environmental movement was soon exported to Europe and elsewhere: on one hand, the pragmatic Friends of the Earth and the media-oriented organization Greenpeace , and, on the other hand, eco-fundamentalist groups like Earth First! and the Environmental Justice Movement (EJM) or lobbying groups like the World Wildlife Fund.
“Green” eco-activists, while feeling awkward about support from this quarter, nonetheless find them useful allies.
Those who disdain environmental concerns have been ousted at the polls in large numbers, companies invest huge amounts in environmental technologies, states are suing car producers for their climate-adverse policies, and the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol have long been surpassed by some states – a lesson for German and European cities and municipalities.
But the lion’s share of this industrial haze – like the growing pollution of its coastal waters – is a direct result of the rapid industrialization of the Pearl River Delta across the border in China’s Guangdong Province.
Increasingly loud complaints about deteriorating air quality have goaded Hong Kong and Guangdong into embarking on a joint program in which a series of monitoring stations now provides emissions data.
This idea is clearly feasible.
Hong Kong’s leaders to do not want to end up on that infamous list.
The city of São Paulo, which represents around one-third of Brazil’s economy, is embarking on a Green Economy strategy that ranges from transport to greener buildings.
The inherent logic offers, perhaps for the first time, a sustainable growth paradigm that is suited to developing and developed countries alike.
Already, New York City produces more CO2 emissions than all of Norway.
Traffic congestion, in particular, is not only environmentally detrimental; it also imposes substantial time and resource costs on drivers.
In all of these cities, CO2 emissions declined sharply and congestion was significantly reduced, with Singapore experiencing an immediate 45% drop in traffic.
Pick any indicator: trade relative to global GDP, capital flows relative to the global capital stock, and so forth – all are rising.
Emerging economies were immediately affected by credit tightening (including trade finance) and rapid declines in exports, leading to similar shocks there.
Asset prices shifted, and capital rushed out of emerging markets, causing credit conditions to tighten and exchange rates to fall.
Given an expanded mandate and a much larger balance sheet, the International Monetary Fund, with advance notification, could in principle reliably act to stabilize volatile international capital flows, buying time for more orderly domestic responses.
Time and experience will help – that is, so long as high volatility does not destabilize many economies in the interim.
I am relatively certain that the US will successfully manage its reorientation and realignment, but the relative weight and reach of its power will nonetheless decline in the new world of the twenty-first century, as others grow in strength and catch up.
Moreover, while there is no new regional hegemon to follow America, there are numerous contenders for the role.
And what implications does Japan’s nationalist turn – and its risky economic policy – hold for the region? Can India and China stem the deterioration in bilateral relations?
WASHINGTON, DC – In the discussion of whether America’s largest financial institutions have become too big, a sea change in opinion is underway.
I think maybe banks have gotten too complex to manage as opposed to just too big to manage.”
Big banks get a big taxpayer subsidy – in the form of downside protection for their creditors.
“I think that the real purpose and the real need that we have in this country for banks is to make loans particularly to small business and to individuals.
Those who oppose their proposed reforms are most likely insiders – people who have received payments from big banks over the past year or two.
While I share these concerns, others frequently rely on two key arguments to dismiss the fear of a run on the dollar: the dollar is a reserve currency, and it carries fewer risks than other currencies.
Even if these countries want to continue to hold a minimum core of their portfolios in a form that can be used in the traditional foreign-exchange role, most of their portfolios will respond to their perception of different currencies’ risks.
If foreign holders of dollar bonds become concerned that the unsustainability of America’s situation will lead to higher interest rates and a weaker dollar, they will want to sell dollar bonds.
A large majority of Arab youths, around 70%, say that they are most influenced by parents, family, and religion, whereas only about a third report that elite groups – writers, business leaders, community leaders, and media outlets – have any influence on their outlook on life.
The trend is often accelerated by the loss of jobs, which often leads people to abandon their professional and functional identities in favor of identities based on ethnicity, kinship, or religion.
At the heart of the crisis is a strong element of indifference.
But what is urgently needed is a strong complementary focus on job creation to preserve and foster Durkheim’s organic solidarity.
But only the Baltics have secured the sort of independence dreamed of in 1991.
The dream of empire is, indeed, the gulag that imprisons the Russian mind.
In the fifteenth century, Moscow was declared a “Third Rome,” the savior of spiritual Christianity.
What matters is selling the reserves and being rich now, not finding more for later.
The evidence in this case, as in so many others, consists of Microsoft Word documents found on a computer that belonged to Saylan’s foundation.
Yet none of the trials has yet been derailed.
A senior police commissioner who had been close to the movement and wrote an exposé about its activities was accused of collaborating with the far-left groups that he had spent much of his career pursuing; he, too, ended up in jail.
Yet Erdoğan, known for his brash style, responded with remarkable equanimity.
What has yet to be recognized is the separate, and quite disturbing, role that the Gülen movement has played in bringing Turkey to its current impasse.
It is one thing to modify the behavior of a state beyond its borders, but quite another to alter what takes place within another country’s territory.
Nor could sanctions trigger a change in government in Baghdad.
History suggests that the US ought to think twice before continuing its effort to remake Afghan society or its government.
CAMBRIDGE – China and Russia have just provided the world with sharp contrasts in the use of power.
Soft power is rarely sufficient, but it is often crucial to combine soft and hard power to have an effective “smart power” strategy.
In early August, Russia set a trap in South Ossetia, and Georgia foolishly walked into it.
Opinion polls show an improvement in its international reputation.
This spring’s presidential election in Haiti sadly re-enforced the country’s blighted reputation.
But America regarded Haiti as a threat rather than as a colleague in freedom, refusing to extend diplomatic recognition until after the outbreak of the Civil War, which finally brought an end to slavery in the US.
Urban violence spiraled.
Similarly, health conditions are horrendous, but could be improved dramatically just with immunization, de-worming, safe water, antibiotics, and anti-malaria bed nets.
Hamas won 76 of 132 seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, and can count on support from four independent deputies.
If Fatah refuses to join a coalition, Hamas may opt for a government of independents and technocrats.
For the first time, a political clock is ticking for Hamas.
Whether Hamas can actually be transformed into a more moderate organization is impossible to say right now.
And Palestinians accepted Hamas’s view that negotiations based on the Oslo Accords could not achieve Palestinian rights and political ambitions.
It was clear before the January 2006 elections that Hamas was heading toward a victory.
Consequently, Hamas will not moderate its stance, and its victory sets back the chances of Israel-Palestinian peace for decades.
Fatah’s rule is still strong in the West Bank, but even the Gaza catastrophe is unlikely to lead it to change its ways.
Gaza is ruled by a completely hostile regime.
GAZA CITY – The resumption of direct peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis has broken 20 months of stalemate, and marked the entry of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu into this round of diplomacy.
This, in turn, puts the spotlight on ongoing security cooperation between Israel, the PA, and the United States, again undermining the PA’s claims to represent the Palestinian people.
For now, Hamas and the Palestinians of Gaza are excluded from the peace talks, which means that the negotiations will most likely not lead to an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
He is wagering his scant remaining authority on the talks’ success, and Palestinians will be counting down his days in office should he fail.
And, with that change, the fate of the Front may be changing, too.
The left has, of course, denounced this move as risking fascism.
And she has brought a fresh anti-capitalist tone to the Front’s rhetoric – always a crowd pleaser in France.
Anti-capitalist revolution was tried in half of Europe in the last century, with dire results.
It certainly did not serve homeowners who are losing their homes, workers who have lost their jobs, retirees who have seen their retirement funds vanish, or taxpayers who paid hundreds of billions to bail out the banks.
The bailout exposed deep hypocrisy all around.
Those countries, like Australia, that implemented large, well designed stimulus programs early emerged from the crisis faster.
For example, while the benefits of many of the financial-engineering innovations of recent years are hard to prove, let alone quantify, the costs associated with them – both economic and social – are apparent and enormous.
Taiwan’s former first family turned out to be a den of common thieves.
This official effort to portray native “Taiwanese” as a separate ethnic group, with scant relation to Chinese culture, was extended to language, as Chen favored using the Fujian dialect in lieu of the Mandarin spoken by 1.3 billion Chinese and taught all over the world.
But in Chen’s Taiwan, domestic squabbles took precedence over economic development.
After all, it was once widely asserted that an African-American without a political machine could not become president.
As Henry Kissinger once noted, “what is presented by foreign critics as America’s quest for domination is very frequently a response to domestic pressure groups.”
If asked whether they like their democratic system of government, 90% say yes.
The Internal Revenue Service sees no increase in tax cheating.
Whether the American political system can reform itself and cope with such problems remains to be seen.
Malaria can be brought under decisive control through bed nets, indoor spraying of insecticides, and making medicines freely available to poor people in malaria-prone villages.
Currently, an alarming number of newborns die because of infection, mothers’ failure to breastfeed during the first days, or other preventable causes.
Recent success stories have been made possible through a combination of increased spending from poor countries’ budgets, supplemented by aid from rich-country donors.
BERLIN – This April was the hottest April on record, globally, for at least 130 years, according to the worldwide temperature records maintained by NASA and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
That is surprisingly simple: there is only one source of heat coming in, and that is radiation from the sun (which is largely visible light, or what physicists call short-wave radiation). And there is only one form of heat leaving the planet, and that is radiative heat (which is invisible, or what physicists call long-wave radiation).
But shrinking snow and ice cover is itself a result of warming, so reduced reflection of solar rays is not the primary cause of warming. Rather, it is a feedback that amplifies warming.
We can calculate how much this has changed the Earth’s heat balance.
It will most likely continue to do so until we stop it by cutting CO2 emissions.
Goldman Sachs, the venerable Wall Street firm at the epicenter of financial globalization, paid more than $16 billion dollars in compensation to its 25,000 employees in 2006, and spun out another $9 billion for its shareholders – a total that is greater than the annual income of most African countries.
I should have stifled myself: Eddie, figuring he had a live one, sent the missing attachment with a note saying “We are so glad someone of your stature might be interested and, by the way, if you have any friends or colleagues who might be interested, could you please forward this email to them also?”
So pressure outside the US and Britain to put the hedge fund industry on a tighter regulatory leash is hardly surprising.
Russia’s first democratically elected leader, he was also the first Russian leader to give up power voluntarily, and constitutionally, to a successor.
Moreover, no nuclear weapons were unleashed, deliberately or accidentally, and no full-scale war of the kind that ravaged post-communist Yugoslavia broke out between Russia and any of its neighbors, although several of them were locked in internal or regional conflict in which Russia’s hand was visible.
Campaigners for democracy admired Yeltsin’s struggle against the conservatives in the politburo – especially after he was forced out of the party’s inner circle in November 1987.
At some level, he sensed that Russia’s potential could be unleashed only if the government either faced down, or bought off, the special interests – military, industrial, and agricultural – that stood in the way.
Every forecaster recognizes that the actual growth rate may be higher or lower than the number that he states.
Recent US data have clearly raised the probability that the economy will run out of steam and decline during the next 12 months.
But what will happen in the third quarter and beyond now that that program has ended?
Finally, high finance allows for portfolio diversification, so that individual investors can seek high expected returns without being forced to assume large, idiosyncratic risks of bankruptcy and poverty.
Our invested wealth can only be made to appear liquid to any one of us, and only if there is no general shift in our collective desire for liquidity.
Moreover, for Keynes, “[t]he game of professional investment is intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll...”
Fashion has been transformed by the recent emergence of retail chains that hire good designers to make throwaway clothing and accessories that are right on trend.
Boycotts of sweated college t-shirts in the United States led to fairer manufacturing practices, and boycotts of coffee and produce, led mostly by women consumers, resulted in fair-trade purchases by major supermarkets.
Their leaders make the point that, at current pay levels, workers cannot feed themselves or their families.
But it already costs too much to the women who can’t afford to feed and house themselves and their children.
But, even in narrow cost-benefit terms, it makes sense to spend more on treating depression.
In China, according to a recent article by Teh-wei Hu and colleagues in Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology , depression costs 51 billion renminbi, or more than $6 billion, per year at 2002 prices.
So, while we can and should do much better at treating it, perhaps the more significant question is whether we can learn to prevent it.
Not everyone wanted to be modern, of course, and not everyone could put in place the institutions and policies necessary to make democracy and capitalism work, but no alternative system would yield better results.
But this is different from saying that there is a universal desire to live in a liberal society – that is, a political order characterized by a sphere of individual rights and the rule of law.
Democratic transitions need to be driven by societies that want democracy, and since the latter requires institutions, it is usually a fairly long and drawn out process.
Yet, for once, Bush actually hit upon a historical analogy that was true.
Instead of helping Japanese of the old school restore an authoritarian system, General Douglas MacArthur’s administration helped Japanese liberals restore and improve their prewar democratic institutions.
The same was true in the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand, and, indeed, in the Middle East, where democracy is yet to take root.
The Hollow Heart of Medical Science
Though today’s biomedical science claims to search for repairs of nature’s defects, too many of its practitioners behave as if their real purpose were only to gain the mythical immortality of precedence, at whatever cost to themselves or others.
Professors do not deserve the title unless they are willing to take the time and make the effort to openly affirm something beyond their data.
The crises that the two institutions now face in the wake of Ireland’s vote against the Lisbon Treaty and the deterioration of security in Afghanistan are of course very different.
And, without confronting much more seriously the “sanctuary” role unwillingly played by Pakistan, there is no solution ahead for NATO in Afghanistan.
One thing is certain; a “shrinking West,” as long as it retains some influence, must create the best institutions it can during the time it still has.
But, while much more needs to be done to meet the immediate needs of this famine’s victims, we should also be thinking now about long-term solutions to preclude food crises on this scale from happening in the first place.
The first focused on 225,000 of Ethiopia’s most at-risk farmers, and got them what they needed immediately: food.
New drought-tolerant maize varieties, for example, are already benefiting more than two million smallholder farmers in Africa.
Indeed, while Asia is rising, the rich industrial countries of the old G-7 have been drifting into a liquidity trap.
But the effect of a new round of QE on interest rates could be small and limited to an announcement effect, as the Fed’s own research indicates.
“It’s no use throwing dollars out of a helicopter,” as Brazilian Minister of Finance Guido Mantega put it.
The impact of the Fed’s policy and hot money has been dramatic.
And, in a world where the G-7 no longer drives global growth, printing money is playing with fire.
Similarly, the journal Science reports that new studies show that ocean levels may rise much more rapidly and precipitously than anticipated.
Unlike George W. Bush’s administration, which remains cavalier in its disregard for the warning signs of climate danger both at home and globally, Hu Jintao’s leadership has begun to evince a hopeful assertiveness, at least in domestic environmental policy.
If climate change were on the agenda for Hu’s upcoming trip, the meeting, whether or not it is designated a “state visit,” could be one of historic consequence.
We need a deal by the end of 2009 in order to institute more ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.
Harvests may halve and rivers on which irrigation and hydropower depend may become a mere trickle.
BERKELEY – At the end of 2008, as the financial crisis hit with full force, the countries of the world divided into two groups: those whose leaders decided to muddle through, and China.
Now it appears to have abandoned that claim in favor of the message that failure to cut will produce disaster.
When interest rates are low and you can borrow on favorable terms, the market is telling you to pull government spending forward into the present and push taxes back into the future.
But businesses establish lines of credit for future contingencies all the time, and they don’t think there is anything humiliating about resorting to them when those contingencies come to pass.
Perhaps more interesting is the ongoing modernization of the language in which those debates are conducted: Latin.
Technology-fueled development is causing historical eras to become cumulative, rather than linear.
At the MIT Media Lab, double-amputee Hugh Herr has pioneered “biomechatronics,” which combines biology, mechanical engineering, and electronics to invent efficient, lifelike prosthetics.
Improved technological capacity would not only help citizens to compete for jobs; it would help countries thrive in the new global environment of increasing hybridization.
But these eras have been characterized by conquest and exploitation, not peace.
On the contrary, a resurgence of right-wing economics, driven, as always, by ideology and special interests, once again threatens the global economy – or at least the economies of Europe and America, where these ideas continue to flourish.
Meanwhile, the US financial sector has been lobbying hard to free itself of regulations, so that it can return to its previous, disastrously carefree, ways.
But austerity undermines growth, worsening the government’s fiscal position, or at least yielding less improvement than austerity’s advocates promise.
If the IMF had to live up to private-sector standards, it would create a new instrument that would meet members’ potential demand for short-term liquidity.
“Giving confidence” to this sort of customer requires the capacity to provide quick, automatic, meaningful, and front-loaded financial support; otherwise, accumulating reserves and pooling them in regional agreements will still look like a more reliable option.
The Fund has no instrument to provide short-term liquidity to emerging markets facing capital volatility.
Some argue that furnishing members with rapid and front-loaded liquidity insurance would encourage irresponsible policies or reckless borrowing.
This latest round of monetary tightening in China reflects the authorities’ growing concern over liquidity. In 2009, M2 money supply (a key indicator used to forecast inflation) increased by 27% year on year, and credit expanded by 34%.
China’s large state sector (which accounts for more than 30% of GDP) is usually careless about losses, owing to the soft budget constraints under which they operate.
Some people would prefer China to move to a totally free market without regulation and management, but the recent crises have reminded everyone that free-market fundamentalism has its drawbacks, too.
Using bank credits to speculate in equity and housing markets is still mostly forbidden.
Latin Amercia’s middle class grew by around 50%, to 152 million, from 2003 to 2009, accounting for around 30% of the continent’s population – a proportion that undoubtedly has grown since.
Almost every social-security system in the region is losing money.
This might seem an obvious shortcoming that governments would readily sort out.
The 2008 Obama campaign used the slogan “Change we can believe in.”
And, while the book’s specific policy proposals bear little resemblance to Roosevelt’s subsequent actions, the title had an intrinsic appeal that he must have recognized.
Formulating a good metaphor for Obama’s second term is itself a task for intuitive creative thought that entails rethinking what he will propose in his second term.
The Dodd-Frank financial reforms created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, so that privately issued financial products would serve the public better, and created incentives for derivatives to be traded on public markets.
PRINCETON – How the mighty International Monetary Fund has fallen. More than a decade ago, the French magazine Paris Match carried a picture of the Fund’s then Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, with the title: “The Most Powerful Frenchman in the World.”
Indeed, the Fund almost disappeared into complete oblivion during their tenure.
Sarkozy and his strategists, no doubt, thought that sending DSK to the Fund, which before the global financial crisis looked unimportant and marginal, was a brilliant coup.
The IMF’s history is also a guide to the kind of figure who works most productively in Washington.
The next one should be Eastern rather than Western, an economist rather than a politician, and a visionary rather than a tactician.
We have just lived through one of these episodes.
At the same time, while getting the crisis-response mechanisms right is important, it is not the whole story.
The G-20 is now the priority-setting and decision-making body for this kind of challenge, the crisis having made it clear that the G-7 could no longer perform this function.
The international exchange-rate system is at least partially broken.
But without it, the G-20 will mostly likely be reduced to a talking shop, characterized by good intentions, but with no effective way of realizing them.
But the current financial market turmoil has shown that there are regulatory and supervisory gaps and poorly understood international linkages that call for a global response.
Financial sector analysis should become fully integrated into the IMF’s surveillance activities.
The IMF Beyond The Crisis
It would be a big mistake to let that happen.
The IMF can help monitor whether countries follow up on agreed undertakings in the FSB, and alert leaders to gaps in the regulatory framework and vulnerabilities in the financial system that need to be addressed.
(The yuan should be included as soon as China makes its currency convertible.)
Once upon a time, the Fund had scores of programs across the Continent (as Rong Qian, Carmen Reinhart, and I illustrate in new research on “graduation” from sovereign debt crises.)
What a difference a crisis makes.
Countries usually call in the IMF only when they have been jilted by international capital markets, and are faced with desperate tightening measures no matter where they turn.
But, for the most part, the sovereign default process is slow-motion Kabuki theater.
The question for the IMF in Europe is not whether it has a plan viable for getting in. It has landed in force.
When asked about the role of capital controls, Strauss-Kahn said he was not wedded to any rigid ideology on the subject.
But more important was the symbolism of Brazil’s move, for it suggests that emerging markets may be getting over their doomed infatuation with foreign finance.
If, on the other hand, market participants do bear significant costs – either because of the taxes they pay or because of the expenses they incur to evade them – the controls will be effective in restraining inflows.
The first stop was the European Union in the late 1980’s, where two French Socialists – Jacques Delors and Pascal Lamy (the president of the European Commission and his assistant, respectively) – led the way.
The new mission is crucially important, both for the health of the global economy and the IMF’s own legitimacy.
If one looks at multilateral trade imbalances, the US stands head and shoulders above all others.
Subsidizing their own farmers would divert money from education, health, and urgently needed development projects.
It is difficult to see how a change in China’s exchange rate would have a significant effect on either savings or investments in the US – and thus how it would redress global imbalances.
With its ability to mobilize large financial resources and buttress policy credibility, the IMF can help mitigate the large economic and social costs often associated with crises.
Some observers have dubbed the new facility “EZ loan,” though few countries meeting the qualifying criteria would consider their policy achievements – and their commitment to maintaining that record – anything but “easy.”
At the same time, these reforms are only a part of a much larger plan for IMF renewal.
In particular, the IMF now recognizes that capital-account liberalization requires countries to reach a certain threshold with respect to financial and governance institutions, and that many emerging-market and developing countries have not.
Unlike in the past, however, emerging and developing countries avoided the worst, precisely because they had learned to accumulate foreign reserves and regulate cross-border capital flows, and to ease such measures to prevent or mitigate sudden stops.
But the new view also highlights an important obstacle: many advanced countries’ trade and investment treaties prohibit the regulation of cross-border finance.
Indeed, the work needed to build a more robust, stable, and safe global financial system has only just begun.
More specifically, what are the governance priorities for policymakers in 2010? This past autumn, IMF members endorsed the G-20’s proposals, and asked the Fund to address four key reform areas – the so called “Istanbul Decisions” – in 2010: the IMF’s mandate, the Fund’s financing role, governance, and multilateral surveillance.
Greater legitimacy, in turn, will make the IMF more effective in promoting economic growth and stability in all of our member states.
Policymakers have a big agenda ahead, but they have already made an impressive start.
Iceland showed that responding to the crisis by imposing capital controls could help small countries manage its impact.
Even if they are not fully effective, they are typically far better than nothing.
For progressives, these abysmal facts are part of the standard litany of frustration and justified outrage.
Now it has acknowledged the reality that financial globalization can be disruptive – inducing financial crises and economically adverse currency movements.
The problem was with domestic policies, not with financial globalization, so the solution lay not in controls on cross-border financial flows, but in domestic reforms.
The first point can be best seen using an analogy with gun controls.
Along the efficiency frontier of financial regulation, one needs to consider the tradeoff between financial innovation and financial stability.
The recent Green Paper released by the European Commission on international migration is no exception.
Finland tightened its immigration regulations in 2004, following closely the restrictive stance taken by Denmark in 2002.
But national governments remain reluctant to delegate authority: in November 2004, the European Council accepted qualified majority voting on measures concerning illegal migration, but left restrictions on legal migration subject to unanimity rules, as if legal and illegal migration were not merely two sides of the same coin.
Even if the Paper’s suggestion were plausible, which it is not, it begs a larger question: should we prevent migrants from taking entrepreneurial risks?
As a result, countries affected by the Arab Spring now face political spheres that are shaped by crowd dynamics, rather than by genuine political or ideological movements.
This discord is threatening to derail these countries’ burgeoning democratic processes, owing to growing competition between what Le Bon called the “sovereignty of the crowds” and the sovereignty of political elites.
Once in office, Obama launched the White House app, designed to give citizens a new way to connect with their leaders in Washington, including updates on the latest events, insight into administration initiatives, and access to high-resolution photos and live streams of White House events.
Then I learned to cast caution to the wind and venture an answer to this most impossible of questions.
A UNESCO project demonstrated that “each additional year of a mother’s schooling reduces the probability of the infant mortality rate by 5% to 10%”
What is it?
Data published in The Lancet last year show that the top ten most burdensome global diseases are more common in men than women, and often by a large margin.
To be sure, girls and women are less powerful, less privileged, and have fewer opportunities than men worldwide.
NEW DELHI – Competition for strategic natural resources – including water, mineral ores, and fossil fuels – has always played a significant role in shaping the terms of the international economic and political order.
Likewise, food scarcity is a growing problem for Asian countries, with crop yields and overall food production growing more slowly than demand.
The other corridor – work on which has been delayed, owing to an insurrection in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province – will stretch from the Chinese-operated port at Gwadar, near Pakistan’s border with Iran, through the Karakoram mountains to the landlocked, energy-producing Xinjiang province.
Strained political relations among most of Asia’s sub-regions make a region-wide security structure or more effective resource cooperation difficult to achieve.
At the same time, the focus on financial reform in developed economies, while warranted, has contributed to complacency in developing economies.
The financial crisis reduced private financiers’ risk appetite, making long-term exposures unappealing.
Another promising development is the growth of local-currency bond markets.
But the Indian decision also means less money for the big multinational pharmaceutical companies.
Advanced industrialized countries in earlier stages of their development benefited from faster economic growth and greater social welfare by explicitly adopting weaker IP protection than is demanded of developing countries today.
As a result, there are now numerous overlapping protections for pharmaceutical companies that are very difficult for most developing countries to contest, and that often pit their global obligations against their domestic obligations to protect their citizens’ lives and health.
Globally, there is growing recognition of the need for a more balanced IP regime.
Meanwhile, unprecedented urbanization has disrupted traditional family structures, further undermining the role that women can play in economies and societies.
The importance of overcoming these barriers to development was emphasized at a recent symposium (of which I was the chair) at Green Templeton College, Oxford.
Neonaticide (killing infants that are less than one day old), infanticide (killing infants that are more than one day old), and the practice of disposing of female children in favor of male offspring are not only barbaric; they have led to imbalanced gender ratios in many emerging markets.
CAMBRIDGE – The United States Federal Reserve’s recent announcement that it will extend its “Operation Twist” by buying an additional $267 billion of long-term Treasury bonds over the next six months - to reach a total of $667 billion this year - had virtually no impact on either interest rates or equity prices.
A shift in foreign investors’ portfolio preferences away from long-term bonds could easily trigger such a run-up in rates.
Business investment is also weak, even though large corporations have very high cash balances.
The projected increase in the long-term fiscal deficit must be reversed by stemming the growth in transfers to middle-class retirees.
He challenged the prosecution vigorously, defending himself with a feistiness that surprised nearly all who read the transcripts released by the court in real time on the trial’s first day.
A logical question to ask, then, is why the Party allowed an unprecedented degree of openness at the trial.
It is worth recalling that purging him was a deeply divisive affair at the CCP’s highest levels.
His botched – but riveting – trial may be over, but the Bo Xilai show will go on.
So how do we escape from this hole? The familiar debate is between austerity and stimulus.
Simply put, what kind of post-recovery economy do we want? This is where economics becomes political economy.
The premise of the green economic agenda is that we have reached the ecological limits of our current growth model, and that we will need to find ways of living that reduce demands on non-renewable sources of energy.
As Dani Rodrik has well put it: “If economics were only about profit maximization, it would be just another name for business administration.
Hotels and airlines were a special case: their business is dependent on shared use of capital assets.
Overall, I see a broad shift from understanding assets as something you have, to looking for a stream of utility.
With Xtify, service vendors can appeal to customers who are conveniently placed in both space and time – so they can come in now for, say, a discount latte.
You don’t particularly want to lend them out every day, but if someone is willing to pay, say, $200 to rent them for a dinner party, the trouble might be worth it. So you can set a high price to offset the inconvenience and make money on the side.
French President Jacques Chirac’s visit to India this month to complete the sale of 6 attack submarines to India will confirm once more India’s emergence as an economic and diplomatic powerhouse.
Also in December, India became the latest nation to join the EU in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) team, which aims to produce electricity using nuclear fusion, as happens in the sun.
India already is being treated with growing respect in global economic councils.
The second point of convergence between Indian and Western interests is one that will probably get no public mention during Chirac’s visit: India can perhaps serve as a counterweight to China.
NEW DELHI – The ratification by the United States Congress of the historic India-US Nuclear Agreement marks a remarkable new development in world affairs.
But the agreement’s main significance should be seen in terms of the burgeoning Indo-American relationship.
India’s place in America’s consciousness is fundamentally different from what it was just half a generation ago.
The Indian Miracle Lives
Moreover, remittances from overseas Indians remain robust, rising from $46.4 billion in 2008-2009 to $57.8 billion in 2010-2011, with the bulk coming from the blue-collar Indian expatriate community in the Gulf.
Half of India’s growth has come from private consumption, and less than 10% from external demand; by contrast, 65% of China’s real GDP growth comes from exports, and only 25% from private consumption.
An impressive 63% of Indians now have phones, up from just 9% a decade ago; 100 million new phone connections were established last year, including 40 million in rural areas; and India now has 943.5 million telephone connections.
The United Nations’ sixtieth anniversary summit in September reflected its strengths and importance in the many areas in which the international community must work together.
Some have suggested that the Iraq war proved the UN’s irrelevance.
When weapons of mass destruction were not found, the US and its small (and dwindling) “coalition of the willing” conjured up a new rationale – the struggle for democracy.
But the UN needs to be strengthened, by, for example, funding a permanent peacekeeping force.
In the United States, for example, the income share of the top 1% of the population has more than doubled since the late 1970’s, from about 8% of annual GDP to more than 20% recently, a level not reached since the 1920’s.
There was also an explosion of credit-card debt.
This story has a counterintuitive dimension.
Moreover, interest rates cannot become negative in nominal terms, and rising public debt may increasingly disable fiscal policy.
So observers should not just be asking how far similar events will spread across the region; they should be asking themselves what kind of changes might be coming at home in the face of similar, if not quite so extreme, economic pressures.
The Internet and the financial sector continue to spawn new multi-millionaires and even billionaires at a staggering pace.
We live in an era in which globalization expands the market for ultra-talented individuals but competes away the income of ordinary employees.
Yes, the problems facing Egypt and Tunisia today are far more profound than in many other countries.
A few years ago, in Beijing, he ran one of China's most popular TV shows, each week testing the limits of the authorities' indulgence.
Twenty-five years ago, China had a more egalitarian society than Sweden; today there is vast inequality between city and countryside, between the western provinces and those bordering the Pacific ocean, and within cities, which attract a constant flow of former peasants looking for jobs.
But Indian voters have turned against this model.
More important decisions require an even larger consensus, involving up to 3,000 people.
Regime Change in China?
The exclusive and closed nature of autocracy bars many talented individuals from rising to senior government positions, owing to a pattern of succession that rewards political loyalty over capabilities.
As each preceding generation of rulers cashes in its illicit gains from holding power, the successors are motivated by both the desire to loot even more and the fear that there may not be much left by the time they get their turn at the trough.
But the record of democratic transitions since 1974 suggests that regime change in China is unlikely to be calamitous.
ATHENS – European integration implies successive transfers of national sovereignty to the Union.
There is no easy solution to these problems.
In fact, de-politicization is seen to be advisable because it allows for the easy achievement of balances.
The Lisbon Treaty envisages the EU as a highly outward-looking entity on the international stage.
The EMU is evidence of that.
More recently, local commissions, non-governmental organizations, an increasingly assertive media, and sanctioned public demonstrations have become established channels for mediating social conflict.
Such protests against public agencies, employers, and developers are now commonplace (though not always authorized).
Both policies reflect the skewed distribution of China’s population, with more than 90% squeezed into the eastern half of the country, creating extreme congestion and the potential for political instability.
During the past five years, the consumer price index has increased at an annual rate of just 1.5%.

Since reserves in excess of the required amount did not earn any interest from the Fed before 2008, commercial banks had an incentive to lend to households and businesses until the resulting growth of deposits used up all of those excess reserves.
The size of the broad money stock (known as M2) grew at an average rate of just 6.2% a year from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012.
That outcome is more likely if high rates of long-term unemployment and underemployment persist even as the inflation rate rises.
Associations – committees of Catholic business owners, labor leaders, and officials – must set quotas, prices, and wages within vertically connected swaths of the economy called corporations.

Indeed, Corporatism spread to country after country.
Indeed, the prominence of Corporatism in Catholic education is remarkable.
Corporatist subsidiarity lets the top of the hierarchy determine its own powers, while banishing competition and lauding private property generates inequality and inefficiency simultaneously.
How odd of Mao’s heirs, however accidentally, to resurrect this forsaken Catholic ideology.
The free flow of information constrains official power and gives individuals the power to act for themselves.
This virus would continuously nudge government agencies to become more effective and accessible, rather than merely more efficient.
Openness and transparency do not mean simply making everything available online, but making information easy to get to, compare, and analyze.
Two big changes are necessary.
The recent dispatch of inspectors to verify the shutdown of North Korea’s weapons reactor and the continuing efforts to ferret out Iran’s nuclear intentions are only the most visible signs of its monitoring function.
Today, this responsibility extends to more than 180 countries.
And in 2004, the IAEA blew the whistle on South Korea’s non-safeguarded plutonium and enrichment experiments.
The unwillingness of more than half the NPT membership to apply the Additional Protocol, which gives the IAEA new flexibility to uncover clandestine nuclear activity, undermines global security.
NEW YORK – Viruses, phishing, spyware, spam, denial-of-service attacks, botnets… You have probably heard these words, and perhaps even suffered from what they signify, with or without knowing it.
They are technically savvy organizations with the ability (more or less) to protect users and detect abusers; they have a direct (though impersonal) relationship with their users; and they compete for users’ business, so that, unlike governments, they will suffer if they perform badly. 
Google does this in its search results, working with StopBadware.org (I am an advisory board member), and both Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer offer similar protections.  In all cases, adventurous users or professionals can overcome the paternalism, but only by paying what amounts to liability insurance, for the risks they impose on the system.
So how do we make this happen? ISPs need to pass these costs on to their customers.
In 1904, US President Theodore Roosevelt argued that, “there are occasional crimes committed on so vast a scale and of such peculiar horror” that we should intervene by force of arms.
Until last year, many observers regarded R2P as at best a pious hope or a noble failure.
Such factors are symptomatic of larger problems with humanitarian interventions.
Military interventions in Sierra Leone, Liberia, East Timor, and Bosnia did not solve all problems, but they did improve the lives of the people there.
At the center of this debate is the so-called doctrine of the “responsibility to protect.”
As a result of this neglect, a noxious social and political residue pervades today’s Kosovo.
This brings me to another key point: a workable exit strategy is just as important to the success of any future humanitarian intervention as the entry strategy.

First, Europe is as much a frontline region in the war on terror as it was during the Cold War.  As last year’s aborted attack on ten airliners heading to the US from London revealed, the likelihood of a terrorist attack on American citizens emanating from a European country remains high.  America may not need the French military, but it certainly needs the French intelligence services. 
The same is true of nations.
Skeptics reply that it would be wrong to link the Iraq War to the “Arab Spring,” because events in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011 had their own origins, while President George W. Bush’s actions and rhetoric discredited, rather than advanced, the cause of democracy in the region.
Bush and his officials used three main arguments to justify invading Iraq.
Most countries agreed that Saddam had defied United Nations Security Council resolutions for a dozen years.
Good coaches analyze their game and their opponent’s game, so that they can capitalize on errors and benefit from “good luck.”
To be sure, Iraqis of different ethnic or religious backgrounds are divided over many issues, but they also embrace a common national identity, as well as a desire for democracy.
Similarly, 78% of Kurds rejected polygamy, compared to just 49% of both Shi’ites and Sunnis.
Leaders of these groups often defended terrorism by insisting that violence was the only means of bringing hope to demoralized people.
The Irish Think Again About the Lisbon Treaty
So the inter-linkage between the ratification crises in Ireland and the Czech Republic is now explicit and threatens to spill over into the wider EU arena in 2009.
Political declarations on the issues outlined would be registered as international treaties at the United Nations to provide binding legal force.
The extraordinary implosion of global financial markets may also work to the advantage of the Yes side in a second referendum, because Ireland’s economic future cannot be contemplated seriously outside of EU structures.
The first Turkish ruler to reign over the Ecumenical Patriarchate was Mehmed II, the Ottoman Sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453.
The Armenians, who suffered the worst tragedy in 1915, never forgot nor forgave.
But you can either trap yourself inside history or take lessons from it and move on.
They realize that religious freedom must be championed for all. And they have a good frame of reference in the pluralism of the Ottomans.
The rage across the Arab world over the publication in Denmark (months ago) of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed, together with the victory of Hamas in Palestine and the increasing radicalization of Iran’s politics, has made “political Islam” a fundamental question of international diplomacy.
It is no accident that there are Islamists in the legislatures of all the countries undergoing some form of political reform, including Lebanon, where Hezbollah is part of a freely elected government, as well as Jordan and Morocco.
It is now necessary to show that democracy is the best path for Palestinians to attain their national goals.
Political Islam is a risk, but we can minimize it only by devising intelligent, case-sensitive strategies that promote democracy, not by denouncing the results of democratic choice.
It must avoid the pernicious ethnic nationalism of recent years that led to one ethnic group being banned from running in the presidential election.
These handicaps to the country’s development grew worse over time.
The political upheavals of 1999-2000 resulted in a new “democratic” constitution that became an invitation to civil war.
The division of the country into more ethnically homogeneous federal components might also promote stability.
Policymaking is often dominated by simple “lessons learned” from economic history.
If two countries achieve the same growth in average WAP income, one should conclude that both have been equally efficient in using their potential, even if their overall GDP growth rates differ.
The US has done slightly worse than suggested by this rough measure; Japan has done a bit better; and most other rich countries come pretty close.
First, the idea of a Japanese-style “lost decade” is misleading – even when applied to Japan.
All these books are variations of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the Russian forgery first published in 1903, which Japanese came across after defeating the Czar’s army in 1905.
In fact, few Chinese, Japanese, Malaysians, or Filipinos have ever seen a Jew, unless they have spent time abroad.
One of the great ironies of colonial history is the way in which colonized people adopted some of the very prejudices that justified colonial rule.
But, instead of wishing to attack them, the Japanese, being a practical people, decided that they would be better off cultivating those clever, powerful Jews as friends.
If you include partially employed workers and discouraged workers who left the US labor force, for example, the unemployment rate is already 16.5%.
By the end of this year about 8.4 million US individuals with mortgages will be unemployed and unable to service their mortgages.
If, like Japan in the late 1990’s and the US in 1937, they take the threat of large deficits seriously and raise taxes and cut spending too much too soon, their economies could fall back into recession.
On the other hand, however, the Court’s decision is one of those judicial pronouncements that attempts to give something to everybody and leave everything as it was.
To decide whether Mladic acted on Serbia’s account when he was planning and ordering the Srebrenica massacre, the Court demanded proof that Serbian officials sent him specific “instructions” to commit this act of genocide.
After all, one can also be guilty of complicity in a crime by not stopping it while having both the duty and the power to do so, and when, through one’s inaction, one decisively contributes to the creation of conditions that enable the crime to take place.
But these potential gains will be realized only if US President Barack Obama gives India the attention it deserves, and if both countries broaden the strategic stake by involving their private sectors in issues that governments alone cannot resolve.
In terms of counterterrorism, the tragic events in Mumbai present an opportunity to ratchet up intelligence sharing, joint response training, and personnel exchanges to defeat the defining threat of our times.
India and the US are natural partners in meeting this challenge, with innovative scientists and venture capitalists who can take technology breakthroughs from the lab to the market, and NGOs with vast grassroots conservation and public advocacy experience.
Perhaps the best way to look at the situation is to recall that three locomotives have driven the world economy over the past 15 years.
The world economy, as John Maynard Keynes put it 75 years ago, is developing magneto trouble.
But low interest rates are entirely compatible with stagnation or depression if risk premia remain large – as the world learned in the 1930’s, and as Japan relearned in the 1990’s.
As a result, investors are worried that China could slip into the excess-leverage growth model that has served many developed economies so poorly.
It is certainly less clear than the previous story, which cannot be retold.
If policymakers choose a model based on a large state-dominated sector protected from internal and external competition, innovation objectives are unlikely to be met, adversely affecting future growth.
Beyond that, more inclusive growth depends on the completion of the urbanization process that underpins the creation of a modern economy; addressing corruption and unequal access to market opportunities; and aggressively mitigating well-known and serious environmental problems.
A quarter of Cambodia's population of eight million was executed, starved to death, or succumbed to disease during the Khmer Rouge's rule from 1975-79.
The first obstacle is cost.
There is thus concern that some in Cambodia's government - which includes officials who once served under the Khmer Rouge - will seek to hijack the trials for political ends.
Before long, an effort to document and publish the truth will be necessary.
Of course, as the murders show, Colombia remains a bizarre place, one facing strange and intractable challenges.
The so-called parapolítica scandals have rocked Uribe’s government, forcing the resignation of some cabinet ministers, and embarrassing others, including the president himself.
But, just as former US Vice-President Al Gore recently refused to share a dais with Uribe in Miami, many members of Congress refuse to approve a trade agreement or an aid package that may link them to a government tainted by egregious human rights abuses, complicity with drug lords, or both.
NEW HAVEN – I admit that it is an unusual way to see the world, but, when reading the newspaper, I am constantly struck by the extent of human kindness.
The explanation for our expanded morality comes from intelligence, imagination, and culture.
An individual who didn’t distinguish between his or her own child and an unknown child in a faraway land – who felt the same love and the same obligation toward both – would hardly be human anymore.
Just as giving to someone in need elicits a positive neural response, so does taking from someone who deserves it.
The Kingdom and the Afghan Chaos
Only recently, it seems, has the Saudi regime discovered the great soft power that its custodianship of Mecca and Medina – Islam’s holiest sites – provides.
But Saudi soft power extends beyond custodianship of Mecca and Medina, for Saudi diplomacy is also backed by the largest oil reserves in the world.
The Iranians vehemently oppose the return of Taliban control over Afghanistan’s government.
Berkeley – Since 2003, I have been saying that the global economy is badly unbalanced and vulnerable to a macroeconomic catastrophe that would yield one of the worst episodes of economic distress of modern times.
I wish – as the Fed does – that some way could have been found to make financial-sector equity holders bear an even larger share of the losses that are coming down the road than they have borne so far or are likely to bear.
That would not be good for America or the world.
Having beaten his Socialist rival, Ségolène Royal, Sarkozy decided to compound the Socialists’ crisis by appointing to his government several political figures long associated with the center-left.
While not denying that state sovereignty was the basis of the international system, Kouchner insisted that it could not be a license for governments to kill.
Grave human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, and genocide would no longer be permitted.
Foreign Minister Kouchner calls international conferences, speaks of establishing contact groups, and of the need for deliberate action.
Redistributing some of the profits from high energy prices enabled the regime to improve living standards and make itself popular with ordinary Russians.
But if prices remain stagnant at current levels, Putin’s system is doomed to failure.
And Obama’s triumph heralded the fall in oil prices.
Now, the ruling group is uniform, unanimous, and most likely unfit for any serious revision of policy.
But this is not news anymore in Putin’s Russia.
General Charles de Gaulle once described himself as a “bad weather friend” of the United States, which implied that in “better weather” he could go his own way, leave NATO’s integrated military command, and behave as some kind of bridge between East and West.
This legitimate “mercantile” concern has supposedly been reciprocated by “small steps” by Russia in the direction of a policy of sanctions against Iran.
The idea that you can play a Medvedev card to balance Putin is a dangerous illusion.
The Kremlin Two Step
For all the apparent freshness of Medvedev’s recent pronouncements, including his now famous article “Go Russia!” – which sounded a clarion call for modernization and liberalism – he is borrowing massively from Putin’s vocabulary of 2000.
Putin wants to finish the job, and much works in his favor. He is the tsar.
Conservative modernization is a gamble.
Both members need each other.
And, yes, of course, it was the same Cliff Reid I knew back in the late 1980’s.
On the other hand, we have started recognizing some words – specific genetic variants – that seem to correspond to certain incidents in history.
We don’t know why, but the correlation is clear.
Most of these are harmless; the really harmful ones don’t survive long enough to show up anywhere.
The current movement in many developed countries towards electronic medical records will improve health care directly, but it will also lead to much improved information liquidity to help genetic and other medical research.
The paradox is that, for a man who wielded so much power for so long, it is unclear what domestic legacy, if any, Blair will leave.
Blair still does.
Blair’s vision of wars of values rather than interests has increasingly come to seem like a moral flag of convenience – in a way similar to the use of human rights by the rich world’s governments to justify their continued domination of institutions like the World Bank and the IMF.
Those pressing for military intervention in Darfur would probably say that this is a bad thing.
At first, the Israeli police used force against the protesters, even though such demonstrations are perfectly legal in Israel.
But some are simply appropriated.
This implies that Jews can push farther and farther into East Jerusalem, as well as build settlements on Palestinian territories around the city, which Israel now claims to be part of Jerusalem.
But the protests are worthwhile for another reason: they are good for Israel.
Citizens are coarsened by the casual brutality meted out to a minority, and become inured to it.
Objections from European and Asian allies were brushed away as old-fashioned, unimaginative, cowardly reactions to the dawn of a new age of worldwide democracy, enforced by unassailable US military power.
This is what happened when Bush and Cheney took up the ideas promoted by the neo-cons.
The idealism of Japanese intellectuals in the 1930’s and early 1940’s was partly responsible for Japan’s catastrophic war to “liberate” Asia from Western imperialism.
There is a core of truth in this assertion.
The Chinese have much to answer for, but the fate of Tibet is not just a matter of semi-colonial oppression.
The wrecking of tradition and forced cultural regimentation took place everywhere in China.
Regional identity, cultural diversity, and traditional arts and customs have been buried under concrete, steel, and glass all over China.
Meanwhile, Chinese and other foreign tourists dress up in traditional Tibetan dress to have their souvenir pictures taken in front of the Dalai Lama’s old palace.
Outside Tibet, however, it is a different story.
Given that resource extraction per square kilometer in Africa is about 20% of the OECD average, the total volume of extraction could easily grow fivefold.
Second, a substantial share of the revenues should be invested in assets rather than used to boost consumption.
Such hostility has made the local operations of extractive industries problematic and costly: witness Royal Dutch Shell’s experience in the Niger Delta. Attacks on installations have often escalated to the point that overall supplies are significantly reduced and less secure.
What is now needed is global enforcement of transparency standards.
When Vice President Dick Cheney spoke at the last World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he was asked how the administration could justify what was taking place in Guatanamo Bay, where prisoners are being kept without being charged and without counsel.
The abuses should have been covered months ago.
We know that individuals and institutions make mistakes. Such mistakes are all the more likely in times of stress.
Each of them was motivated by the horrific lessons of the past.
Assad is particularly worried about the creation of a mixed Lebanese-international court to try suspects in the Hariri assassination.
In the coming weeks, Hezbollah will have to calculate at several levels.
The US must also calculate what the Europeans will accept.
One idea – to elect a candidate with whom everyone can live – would likely produce a weak president.
While Syria’s Lebanese allies have called for improved ties between the two countries, the Hariri murder makes this doubtful.
Within Lebanon, the Sunni-Shiite divide reflects broader regional frictions between the Sunni-majority Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, which backs Saad Hariri, the late prime minister’s son, and Iran, which supports Hezbollah.
Whatever one thinks about the war in Iraq, the US presence there has helped Lebanon to ward off Syrian efforts to reverse its withdrawal, as well as Arab efforts to compel the Lebanese to compromise with a regime that loathes Lebanese sovereignty.
The Israel-Hezbollah war of 2006 reminded the Union, once again, that its strategic interests do not always coincide perfectly with those of the United States.
In effect, the resolution envisaged reversing Hezbollah’s gains and ignores the deep changes that have occurred in Lebanese society, most importantly the Shia community’s growing self-confidence.
Giving the Shia a real stake in the nations in which they live is the only way to satisfy the craving for empowerment that they feel after so many years of suppression.
PARIS – The riots that have rampaged across Greece may have many causes, but one that is rarely mentioned is the fracturing of the Greek left into George Papandreou’s traditional socialist party, PASOK, and an increasingly radicalized faction that refuses all accommodation with either the European Union or modern economics.
Is the present crisis a crisis of capitalism or just a phase of it? This controversy keeps left-wing intellectuals, pundits, and politicians busy on television talk shows and in café debates across Europe.
The Socialists blame greedy financiers, but who does not? In terms of remedies, the Socialists do not offer anything more than the Keynesian solutions that are now being proposed by the right.
European Socialists are also finding it hard to distinguish themselves in foreign affairs.
The lesson from Greece, however, is that what European Socialists should fear most is the far left’s taste and talent for disruption.
Loans to Ireland (€85 billion) and Portugal (€78 billion) are also significantly bigger than those usually provided by the IMF.
There is one bright spot: Ireland, which is set to recover from an exceptionally severe financial crisis.
Once it became clear that the burden was unbearable, debt should have been cut expeditiously.
The ECB is in an odd position as well, but for different reasons.
The world can look to Europe as a model that is not only up and running, but that works.
Firms can readily compare their cost of abating an extra ton of emissions with the cost of the allowance required if that ton is released into the atmosphere.
The fact is that the European economy has been affected more by sub-prime mortgages in the United States than by a carbon price in Europe.
The third broad lesson from the ETS is that multinational emissions-trading regimes can be constructed.
The real problem is one of political will, not of institutional mechanics.
Both sides in these disputes usually omit to mention the key idiosyncratic characteristics and specific starting conditions that can make direct comparisons meaningless.
Latvia’s government increased taxes during the bust to keep revenues roughly constant as a share of GDP, but a sizeable fiscal deficit emerged nonetheless as social-security expenditure, such as unemployment benefits, soared while demand and output collapsed.
That sustained demand provided an important stabilizer for the domestic economy, which the Baltic states did not have.
One must be careful when attempting to draw lessons from the experience of small countries that sometimes have very particular characteristics.
Perestroika took place at a unique moment in Russian history.
Thus, perestroika took place in a void.
Much of what socialism built needed to be undone.
We must recognize that and understand that it emerges not only when the public is apathetic or frightened, but also when there is no apparent stable advanced guard, such as powerful political parties, which choose the leaders and control them.
The country needs a deeper commitment to reform that will come only when its institutions engage the Russian public in the sort of open debate that we have lacked.
It was a desperate time, brief but seared in our memories, when indiscriminate killings on trains, in taxis, and on buses were common, a time of massacres at regular intervals – Sebokeng, Thokoza, Bisho, Boipatong, and the killing fields of KwaZulu Natal, owing to the bloody rivalry between the African National Congress and the ethnic Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party.
Truth, not punishment, was to bring about healing.
The lesson of South Africa’s transition is that no divided country has a future if it insists on going forward without truth and forgiveness.
Remembrance and forgiveness have allowed our remembered nightmares to be consigned to the past.
Their bad assets will be separated and wound down over time.
No bank in difficulties can survive if the ECB does not grant or renew emergency liquidity assistance.
But financial markets reacted calmly to the news that, for the first time, even depositors in a bank in the European Union will lose part of their money (and this was noted with glee in Berlin and elsewhere in northern Europe).
Joy over the election’s outcome, however, should not blind us to its failure to meet a series of ethical benchmarks for democratic choice.
Unfortunately, the most recent debates failed to achieve that goal.
Needless to say, neither candidate thought it worthwhile to put forward a proposal to assist the more than one billion people living in extreme poverty.
The Lessons of the World Cup
But the demand side was heavily regulated, owing to a rule that clubs could field no more than two foreign players in any single game.
In Spain, all but three championships since 1985 have been won by either Real Madrid or Barcelona.
The average winning margin among the top eight World Cup national teams has steadily decreased, from more than two goals in the 1950’s, to about 1.5 goals in the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s, and only 0.88 goals in the 2002 World Cup.
The same rule could be applied to other activities.
And what was the result? Convinced that he is right, and incurious to hear contrary arguments, Bush felt free to undermine the rule of law in America with warrantless domestic surveillance, erosion of due process, and defense of torture, in addition to misleading the public and refusing to heed expert advice or recognize facts on the ground.
Putin’s assessment of US unilateralism (if stripped of its overheated rhetoric) may be correct; the trouble is that he lacks credibility to extol moderation in foreign policy.
Indeed, the American people have preempted the historians, rebuking Bush by electing a Democratic Congress in November 2006.
As Council president, France, which shares America’s views about the need to strengthen sanctions on Iran’s government, can raise the matter, something that China eschewed during its tenure in January as Council leader.
Qadaffi exploited a network of opportunity. French-controlled mines in Niger provided uranium ore. An undisclosed country conveyed a pilot uranium conversion facility.
As a result, the government’s confidence and hold on power were shaken.
The Limits of Bonapartism
For all the authoritarian habits of de Gaulle or François Mitterand, Sarkozy’s personalization of the presidency is unprecedented in the history of the Fifth Republic.
In the meantime, his obsession with dominating the daily news cycle, no matter how flimsy the pretext, continues unabated.
Putting an Australian mining executive behind bars for ten years, squeezing out Google, keeping the European Union at bay for an important dialogue, and letting a mid-level official wag his finger at US President Barack Obama at the Copenhagen Climate summit is not, after all, the best way to convince partners of your constructive intentions.
In Brussels and Washington, one gets the impression that the mission of China’s diplomats nowadays is to meet and charm everyone.
One can have the most visible business summits possible, but if Western companies do not gain greater access to the Chinese market, or if they feel threatened by heavily subsidized state-owned enterprises, relations will continue to sour.
For China, it will be hard to build confidence if Europe and the US doubt their own future.
Indeed, with roughly 130 million middle-class consumers, China’s domestic market holds significant potential.
More than 1,400 foreign-funded R&amp;D institutions are currently operating in China, and data from China’s Ministry of Commerce indicate that 480 of the world’s top 500 companies have established local subsidiaries.
As China’s “demographic dividend” disappears, its low-end labor market is shrinking, driving up its once rock-bottom labor costs and diminishing its rate of return on capital.
The election of the militant and hitherto extra-parliamentary group Hamas in the Palestinian territories reminds us of what democracy cannot achieve.
In particular, they do not create a liberal order.
Who sets the rules of the game? There is an obvious logic to establishing a constitutional convention first and then holding elections under the rules agreed by it.
One must add to this criterion a culture of debate that makes elections a genuine contest of a plurality of answers to the issues at stake.
An absurd expectation, one might think.
On the eve of the financial crisis, other Gulf states had started to look to Dubai for insight into how they might diversify their economies and continue to thrive when the oil wells run dry.
One had to be impressed that such ideas could be expressed openly.
Is this the end of the road for Dubai’s epic growth? I doubt it.
Already, variations in the composition of about 500,000 DNA building blocks (SNPs or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), spread over the total length of the DNA and shown to correlate with particular physical and behavioral characteristics or susceptibility to diseases, are being analyzed routinely.
Nonetheless, the dangers implied by recent technological progress have become increasingly obvious.
Major regional powers like Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar now support an emboldened Hamas, whose paramount objectives are now to consolidate its increased international legitimacy and sideline the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA).

Hamas’s military collapse would not pave the way for the moderate Fatah to return to power in Gaza; it would enthrone Islamic Jihad and Al Qaeda.
The current cease-fire, however, will be as short lived as many others before it – its terms are practically identical to those that ended Operation Cast Lead – if Israel does not follow up with a vigorous peace initiative on the broader Palestinian front.
Christianity, with its belief that God (or the Son of God) sacrificed Himself to expiate humanity’s sins, inverted the traditional economy of sacrifice.
Churchill gave Britons something to look forward to: victory.
Europe’s leaders must imbue their citizens with renewed hope.
Today, Germany has a balanced budget, whereas most other eurozone countries are running deficits that are higher than Germany’s ten years ago.
On one hand, wage restraint was the key element, though the government could not impose it.
Long-term fiscal consolidation requires, in the first instance, expenditure restraint; and labor-market reforms can, over time, bring marginal groups into employment.
The reforms undertaken in some peripheral countries are much deeper than those undertaken by Germany a decade ago.
By offering to lend freely against collateral, they “liquify” assets and prevent banks from being forced to unload loans or securities at fire-sale prices.
Indeed, with its recent decision to pursue QE3, the Fed is focusing once again on the mortgage-backed securities market; but, given that the market is much healthier now, it is unclear how much good this will do.
In theory, as capital floods in, these countries’ exchange rates will appreciate rapidly, making them look unattractive and automatically stemming the flow.
A last defense offered by advocates of continuing on the path of adventurous monetary policy, even when the perceived benefits are small, is that, because politicians refuse to settle their differences and act, monetary policy is “the only game in town.”
But is it true?
This pattern of trade has now been mirrored in the increasing geographical spread of BSE from the UK to other countries in Europe, and more recently to Japan and the United States. This unfortunately has been accompanied by increasing number of variant CJD cases in Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and the USA.
Further uncertainty regarding the future of variant CJD arises from the observation that the average age of the patients in the UK has not increased significantly over the past 10 years. If the epidemic were in decline, it might be anticipated that the average age of the patients would increase in the final stages (as occurred with cattle in the UK that were infected with BSE).
Malnutrition kills an innocent child every five seconds, and is responsible for 11% of the global burden of disease.
Indeed, stunting has come to represent the true face of contemporary global poverty, causing irreparable damage to children’s cognitive development and physical growth.
We must make markets work for them and their families.
Similarly, in India’s Rajasthan state, high-quality complementary foods produced by decentralized women’s self-help groups are improving the nutrition of children aged 6-36 months.
Liquid assets are assets that resemble cash, because they can easily be converted into cash and used to buy other assets.
Central banks worldwide clearly have been behaving quite responsibly with regard to general inflation since 2005.
True, savings rates in emerging markets and oil-rich countries have been increasing since 1970, and especially in the last few years, but this has been offset by declining saving rates in advanced countries.
He says that it merely reflects a feedback mechanism that is always present: any initial upward shock to asset prices strengthens the balance sheets of financial institutions, so in response they borrow more and bid up prices even more.
Yet, because an exchange rate is a relative price, all currencies cannot weaken simultaneously.
It is just over a year since Switzerland surprised many when it announced, and strictly implemented, a threshold beyond which its currency would not be allowed to appreciate against the euro.
Yet, when push comes to shove, country after country is being dragged into abetting a potentially harmful outcome for the global economy as a whole.
Specifically, it is hoped that an artificial surge in asset prices will make people feel richer and more optimistic, thus triggering “wealth effects” and “animal spirits” that stimulate consumption and investment spending, bolster job creation, and, in the process, “validate” the artificial asset pricing.
This period of expanding policy inconsistencies could prove to be temporary and reversible if central banks succeed in jolting economies out of their malaise, and if countries come to recognize that greater cross-border policy coordination is urgently needed.
The headline numbers do not look so bad.
Inflation is increasing beyond what can be explained by rising commodity and food prices, while credit growth and some asset prices are starting to look high relative to historical standards.
Fiscal repair is also essential.
It is fragile, unbalanced, and limited.
At the same time, a recent "white paper" produced by a working group headed by the IMF's former boss, Michel Camdessus, which was charged with proposing the type of structural reforms needed to achieve growth, was received with the usual outcry from trade unions.
But real tax cuts also mean spending cuts and, as elections loom barely a year from now, it is too late.
First, it makes consumers anxious and depresses demand.
KATMANDU – Confounding everyone except themselves, Nepal’s hard-line Maoists have taken a commanding role following the country’s landmark elections.
A second priority will be to decide the fate of Nepal’s centuries-old monarchy.
The main challenge for the Assembly is to forge onward, keeping in mind that the road ahead is full of seemingly insurmountable challenges.
What’s more, they will have also helped to improve their own lives and enhance the economic prospects of their wider community.
What all of this means is that by measuring the effectiveness of vaccines merely in terms of “lives saved,” we could be seriously underestimating the full extent of the benefits that they offer.
As a result, we have prevented 5.5 million deaths, and we aim to immunize a further 245 million children and save five million more lives by 2015.
Development economists wring their hands in despair: Africa defies their best efforts to create a miracle.
Despite the eight-fold increase in aid per head to the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1960 and 2007, real GDP per head decreased by two-thirds in the same period.
Many countries had “failed” states that could not provide even the minimum conditions of security and health. With 15% of the world’s population, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 88% of the world’s conflict-related deaths and 65% of AIDS victims.
Citing the British mission to Sierra Leone, Collier argues for military intervention, when feasible, to secure peace.
Other efforts worthy of attention include formalizing the huge informal economy in states such as Ghana.
Sustainable development therefore requires that, relative to their populations, each generation should bequeath to its successor at least as large a productive base as it inherited.
When an economy eats into its productive base in order to raise current production, eventually GNP will decline, too, unless policies were to so change that wealth begins to accumulate.
As for natural capital, the World Bank has so far limited itself to the atmosphere as a sink for carbon dioxide, oil, and natural gas, and forests as sources of timber.
But there are limits to substitutability: the costs of substitution (including human ingenuity) often increase in previously unknown ways as key resources are degraded.
But Lula’s popularity reflects his political skill as much as the success of his social and economic program.
Consumption is being spurred by record-low unemployment rates, below 7%, and by credit growth, which has doubled, from 22% to 45% of GDP, between 2002 and 2010.
A recent decline in primary surpluses has added to the problem.
FEZ – Just over a year ago, the Arab Spring sparked dramatic change throughout the Arab world.
This new political reality in the Maghreb will bring Europe –&nbsp;particularly France, the region’s old colonial master – face-to-face with Islamist governments determined to promote a new type of relationship.
That remains very much an open question.
Before an economically unified Maghreb can be realized, however, inter-state conflicts such as the Algerian-Moroccan dispute over the “Western” Sahara must be resolved.
For starters, it remains unclear whether the Federal Reserve will begin to “taper” its open-ended quantitative easing (QE) in September or later, how fast it will reduce its purchases of long-term assets, and when and how fast it will start to raise interest rates from their current zero level.
Germany’s general election appears likely to produce a repeat of the current government coalition of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democrats, with opinion polls suggesting that a grand coalition between the CDU and the Social Democrats is less likely.
These economies – the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) and others – were overhyped for too long.
The looming known unknowns are plentiful.
Z. A. Bhutto’s legacy was empowerment of the impoverished and defense of ordinary people’s rights amid feudalistic politics and military rule.
After almost a decade in self-imposed exile, Bhutoo’s return to Pakistan in October gave her a fresh political start.
Whether or not the government was involved, the fact remains that Pakistan has lost a desperately needed leader.
Moreover, although China’s “trade dependency” is now reckoned to be 70% of GDP, that figure is greatly distorted by the fact that Chinese exports require massive imports of materials and parts.
That is exactly what is happening in China now.
If that is true, and China shouldn’t worry about the renminbi’s exchange rate, should it worry about its economy overheating? After all, its previous trade deficits in the era of reform – such as in 1992-1996 and 2003-2004 – all occurred at times of overheating.
That means that investment is extremely high – and that, despite the high share of infrastructure investment, there is an urgent need to manage the potential risks.
Martin Luther King, Jr. benefited from growing up in an African-American church tradition rich in the rhythms of the spoken word.
If one compares those images with pictures of the young insecure Gandhi dressed as a proper British lawyer, one can see how carefully he understood symbolic communication.
Organizational skills – the ability to attract and inspire an effective inner circle of followers – can compensate for rhetorical deficiencies, just as effective public rhetoric can partly compensate for low organizational skills.
During the 2008 presidential election campaign, Obama proved to be a talented communicator.
BRUSSELS – If French President Nicolas Sarkozy had written the prologue to his presidency of the G-20, which has just commenced, he could not have done better.
Japan is keen, but its views on regional monetary cooperation do not match China’s.
Many, especially in Asia and the Persian Gulf, are de facto linked to the dollar, others to the euro.
This rule normally ensures a modicum of coherence and avoids overreactions in exchange rates, but it is insufficient in deflationary times.
These reserves now amount to 15% of global GDP, compared to 6% ten years ago.
The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell once compared a monetary regime to a political constitution, because it establishes the rules of the game.
Everybody was tired, but my father wasn’t in a hurry to sleep.
The story occupied the same amount of space as a report on Zhukov’s visit to Yugoslavia, and ran in a less prestigious position.
The committee requested it from the Soviet government.
Korolev was offended but kept silent.
Technically, Glushko, by government order, continued to design engines for Korolev, but the work wasn’t good.
Moreover, the benefits of the growth have been shared.
Moreover, Malaysia’s multiracial, multi-cultural society made it more vulnerable to civil strife, which has occurred in many other resource-rich countries, as one group tried to seize the wealth for itself.
Malaysia wisely took an alternative course, looking instead to the highly successful countries of East Asia.
He is a fluent English speaker who does not have a secret-service background and has been dealing with the West for almost a decade as the Russian energy industry’s leading figure.
Given Gazprom’s record of opacity while Medvedev’s was in charge, the existence of kompromat (compromising material), used as blackmail against him to keep his energy policy in line and others’ vested interests safe, is highly likely.
“Putinism” is predicated on the need for an enemy, and that enemy, at least since 2003, is the West.
NEW YORK – Economists long ago put to rest the error that Adam Smith made when he argued that manufacturing should be given primacy in a country’s economy.
In fact, the dubious notion that we should select economic activities based on their presumed technical innovativeness has been carried even further, in support of the argument that we should favor semiconductor chips over potato chips.
But this argument is specious: one can have a vigorous transportation industry, with trucks, rail, and air cargo moving agricultural produce within and across nations, as countries such as pre-Peronist Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and modern Chile have done very successfully.
Even if you wanted to curtail financial services, you could still focus on the multitude of non-financial services.
Without a vibrant manufacturing base, societies tend to divide between rich and poor – those who have access to steady, well-paying jobs, and those whose jobs are less secure and lives more precarious.
The growing proportion of low-productivity labor has also contributed to rising inequality in American society.
When manufacturing takes off, it can generate millions of jobs for unskilled workers, often women, who previously were employed in traditional agriculture or petty services.
I have found in my research that individual manufacturing industries, such as auto parts or machinery, exhibit what economists call “unconditional convergence” – an automatic tendency to close the gap with productivity levels in advanced countries.
But if this happens more rapidly than workers can acquire advanced skills, the result can be a dangerous imbalance between an economy’s productive structure and its workforce.
There are many places where savings can be made.
The system by which doctors and hospitals are paid is another factor in providing expensive treatment that is of little benefit to the patient.
The artificial heart machine, also known as a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, has been used to keep patients alive until they receive a heart transplant.
Against that background, spending $200,000 to give a patient in an affluent country a relatively short period of extra life becomes more than financially dubious. It is morally wrong.
Monarchies – in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and most of the Gulf dynasties – still appear to their subjects to be more acceptable than secular autocracies.
For, in the Gulf, the issue for the US is not democracy versus autocracy; it is one of an Iran-led Shia axis versus the Sunni pro-Western incumbent regimes.
But historical turning points have never been characterized by easy choices, and human blunders frequently shape outcomes more than human wickedness.
In other words, although a caudillo ’s charisma matters, he or she is a social creation.
Traditional parties and the administrations that preceded the caudillo are dismissed as corrupt and elitist.
A decline in extreme poverty and inequality, and the creation of trustworthy institutions, can be achieved in the country’s beguiled by caudillismo only if the caudillo loses control of the wealth that sustains his rule.
On the contrary, in the early part of the twentieth century, Germany was one of the world's richest countries, with enviably high education levels and scientific prowess.
There is no glory on either side of the Israel-Palestine debacle.
A third respondent said something similar. "There was so much outrage about the prisoner abuse, which I certainly don't approve of, but this was much worse," she said, referring to the Berg murder.
Once we recognize how vulnerable all of the world is to this kind of descent into violence, the importance of international law and international institutions such as the United Nations become all the more obvious.
The Market Confidence Bugaboo
For, if economic logic were clear-cut, governments wouldn’t have to justify what they do on the basis of market confidence.
They depend not just on its tax and spending plans but also on the state of the economy, the external conjuncture, and the political context.
The silver lining in all this is that, unlike economists and politicians, markets have no ideology.
Rather than face up to the challenge, leaders first procrastinated and then buckled under pressure.
Marx was certainly a perceptive analyst of the nineteenth century’s version of globalization.
In the face of the difficulties of big automobile producers and smaller suppliers alike, many are demanding that, as part of the rescue package, the state should compel banks to lend. Everyone thinks of the horse that can be led to water, but cannot be made to drink.
In today’s circumstances, the financial system would have been better off if some version of US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s original plan to purchase toxic assets and take them off banks’ balance sheets had been realized.
But its acolytes should reflect on the uniformly disastrous results of centralized credit provision in the past.
Consider home ownership: while American conservatives say that the government’s attempt to extend home ownership to 70% of the US population was responsible for the financial meltdown, 87% of Mauritians own their own homes – without fueling a housing bubble.
During my visit, my interest was to understand better what had led to what some have called the Mauritius Miracle, and what others might learn from it.
This is not to say that Mauritius is without problems.
The US should now do right by this peaceful and democratic country: recognize Mauritius’ rightful ownership of Diego Garcia, renegotiate the lease, and redeem past sins by paying a fair amount for land that it has illegally occupied for decades.
The way that information circulates does reflect, as Howard argues, a conception of how a society/polity should be organized.
One of the Syrian government’s first moves after it began shooting protesters, for example, was to expel all foreign journalists.
The presumption should be that governments with nothing to hide have nothing to lose by allowing their citizens and internationally recognized media to report on their actions.
Anders Behring Breivik in Norway, Jared Lee Loughner in Arizona, Seung-Hui Cho in Virginia – the list of mass murderers defined according to their mental illnesses goes on.
A survey of the American public found that, while 68% of adults knew at least one person who had been hospitalized with a mental illness and 10% knew five or more people, only 9% had ever been threatened or physically harmed by such a person.
But it is more prevalent in developing countries than in the developed world.
While expanding the scope of mental-health services is a positive step, with the potential to contribute to the physical safety of US citizens, it is crucial that this link not be allowed to feed the perception that people with mental illnesses are dangerous.
Today we are fighting the first war in the era of e-mail, blogs, blackberries, instant messaging, digital cameras, the Internet, mobile phones, talk radio, and 24-hour news.
That false story incited deadly anti-American riots in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Free governments must make communications planning a central component of every aspect of this struggle.
This also will mean embracing new ways of engaging people throughout the world.
Inside the European Union, the ugly term PIGS (Portugal, Italy/Ireland, Greece, Spain) is now a commonplace, denoting countries that have endangered the euro’s stability and are forcing northern Europeans into costly bailouts.
As a result, their inability to reform, combined with rapid population growth and a rising cohort of young people, is placing them under pressure, creating a possibility of explosive change.
European officials in Brussels and the major EU governments should not go for political and economic half-measures.
MEXICO CITY – This month, Mexico’s Felipe Calderón celebrates his second anniversary as president.
He remains personally popular and well regarded, but the public is increasingly dissatisfied and disappointed with his government’s actual performance.
Mexico’s government and military had established a tacit, semi-violent, corrupt, but effective modus vivendi with the drug cartels since the early 1970’s.
Moreover, the capacity of Mexico’s security machinery appears diminished.
The Microfinance Catalyst
This type of disruptive innovation usually comes from entrepreneurs.
Within a few years, as their loan books began to grow rapidly, Compartamos and SKS created for-profit businesses that were owned by their respective NGOs.
For example, the Andhra Pradesh state government passed a restrictive ordinance making it difficult for microfinance institutions to recover their loans from their clients.
Up to now, the region (excluding Israel and Turkey) had more or less missed out on the epochal process of worldwide modernization.
Moreover, the situation was exacerbated by the incompetence of the region’s authoritarian regimes, which have been unable to provide their young people with any prospects beyond repression.
Moreover, compared to Eastern Europe in 1989, the Middle East in 2011 lacks any stabilizing external structures, such as NATO and the European Union, that could influence domestic reforms by holding out the prospect of membership.
Economic aid, the opening of the EU and US markets, strategic energy projects, legal and constitutional advice, and cooperation between universities are among the resources that the West must supply if it wants to contribute to the success of the Middle East’s democratic awakening.
Iran’s recent “election” saw blatant manipulation in favor of the incumbent president incite a democratic mass uprising.
Indeed, aside from matters of domestic policy and the issue of internal freedom, the choice between the major candidates hinges on the question of whether Iran should seek greater international integration. Ahmadinejad stands for a policy of confrontation and partial isolation; Moussavi stands for more openness.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has now committed himself to a Palestinian state, and the Hamas leadership, which rejects Israel’s right to exist, has agreed to a Palestinian state within the borders prior to June 5, 1967.
The Middle East’s Democratic F-Words
The states in the Middle East can be characterized by a series of “F-words:” failed, frozen, flexible, flourishing, or frightening.
The small, emirates of the Gulf Cooperation Council are – with the exception of now tottering Dubai &#45;&#45; flourishing states that have joined the global economy through political and economic reform.
In Kuwait, another flourishing state, Wahabbi participation in parliament came only after permission was granted by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Bin Baz, and his successor, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh.
Unless sectarian politics are replaced by inclusiveness, all of the region’s “f-states” types of states will remain in a condition of prolonged turbulence.
One may object that to facilitate internal relocation is to collaborate with “ethnic or religious cleansing”; but the toll of prolonged war in Iraq, which could lead to its dismemberment anyway, is much worse.
As stability in the Middle East is essential to them, this is a matter of enlightened self-interest.
So it is smarter to go after the heroin bosses and their foreign networks, and in the meantime buy the poppy crop from farmers to destroy it.
The Israeli government and Palestinian political leaders are locked in a ruinous struggle, which merely aids extremists on both sides.
Some see war as a way of resolving an increasingly deadlocked situation, shaking up a dysfunctional regional order whose main actors are not only at loggerheads, but are also incapable of resolving the legitimacy deficits of their respective regimes.
Nor has he been able to rein in Iran’s relentless drive for regional hegemony, or convince it to abandon its quest for nuclear arms.
The assassinations – allegedly by Israel – of Imad Mughniyah, Hezbollah’s military chief and Iran’s closest ally in the organization, two years ago, and more recently of Mahmoud al-Mahbouh, Hamas’s liaison officer with the Al-Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, suggest that an unplanned chain of events could trigger a real war.
The Middle East’s Military Delusions
The moderates are in a daily battle with their own extremists, who claim that compromise is impossible.
Israelis and Palestinians came close to agreement on “land for peace” in the context of the Oslo peace process.
Israel refused even to negotiate with the Hamas-led Palestinian government, trying to squeeze it financially and make it capitulate.
Military reprisals will swell their ranks still further, and, until political grievances are addressed, the spread of democracy will not change that equation, because the extremists will win at the ballot box.
Turkey is genuinely interested in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and in a regional system of peace and security, whereas Iran and  Hezbollah are bent on derailing both in order to deny Israel the kind of peace with the Arab world that would end up isolating Iran.
Iran is working to ensure that free elections open the way to truly Islamic regimes in the Arab world, while Turkey assumes that its own political brand, a synthesis of Islam and democracy with secular values, should ultimately prevail.
It is on the Syrian question that the differences between Turkey and Iran are especially apparent.
And yet it is a question that obscures more than it illuminates.
And the former US ambassador James Jeffrey drew on Turkey’s experience, and the 1980 coup in particular, to argue that the military could help in “moderating Islamist movements.”
The loss of continuity in political parties, parliamentary procedures, and judicial processes encourages short-term calculation and spawns illiberal practices.
An entity that is authoritarian and hierarchical in nature cannot be relied on to protect and promote a democratic transition.
MADRID – The revolutions that swept the Arab world during the last two years have exposed the extraordinary fragility of key Arab states.
But the Kurds are hardly alone.
The rebels, mostly Sunnis assisted by jihadi groups such as the Nusra Front, an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq, have never truly attempted to reach out to the country’s minorities – Christians, Shia, Druze, and Kurds – which have repudiated the National Coalition as being “obedient to Turkey and Qatar.”
But there can be no doubt that the post-colonial status quo in the Middle East is crumbling.
That, too, is not surprising, because the situation remains an amorphous mix of hope and destruction.
Any such manifesto must address the two elephants in the room – Palestine and the price of oil – as well as the extent to which regional water and energy resources, now rapidly depleting, should be shared.
Communication may be instant, but, with no coherent animating ideology, the revolution proceeds in slow motion.
But boldness and adaptability do accord with Schumpeter’s emphasis on forming new combinations and doing things in new ways.
·        Cooperation with affiliate firms to reduce transaction costs in sourcing, capital acquisition, and contracts;
The great majority of the roughly 24 million private individuals estimated to have gone into business between 1980 and 2005 were ordinary folk with very small capital – usually obtained by pooling the savings of family members and perhaps friends.
Chinese entrepreneurs nowadays are particularly well adapted to take advantage of new market trends brought about by rapidly changing fashion and similarly rapid technological progress.
First, the data refer to those from 15 to 24 years old. But this age group consists of two sub-groups with very different characteristics.
Only 9% of Greek teenagers are labor-market participants; two-thirds of that number cannot find a job.
Europe has a general macroeconomic problem, owing to demand factors that interact with a rigid labor market, rather than a specific youth-unemployment problem.
The problem stems from how unemployment is measured: The adult unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals in the labor force.
Fortunately, there is a better methodology: The youth unemployment ratio – the number of unemployed youth relative to the total population aged 16-24 – is a far more meaningful indicator than the youth unemployment rate.
And, while some young people use higher education to escape a rocky job market, their choice to build new skills should not negatively impact perceptions of their country’s economic health.
Indeed, trust and confidence in scientific research have not been seriously undermined by reports of misconduct.
Science means constantly walking a tightrope between blind faith and curiosity; between expertise and creativity; between bias and openness; between experience and epiphany; between ambition and passion; and between arrogance and conviction – in short, between an old today and a new tomorrow.
Like the previous generation, many gifted young researchers know that they must work hard to meet monumental challenges and make valuable contributions to society.
The WEO’s prediction of a strengthening recovery this year continues the misdiagnosis.
In 2012, world trade expanded by only 2.5%, while global GDP grew at a disappointing 3.2% rate.
Like the advanced economies, emerging economies experienced a boom in 2000-2007.
In Europe, the banks’ wounds must be closed – weak banks must be shut down or merged with stronger banks – before recovery can begin.
There are also concerns over excessive debt and related fears of a fragile banking system; worries about the ever-present property bubble collapsing; and, most important, the presumed lack of meaningful progress on economic rebalancing – the long-awaited shift from a lopsided export- and investment-led growth model to one driven by internal private consumption.
It takes strategy, time, and determination to pull it off.
These developments – first convergence, and now faster services growth – stand in sharp contrast with earlier trends.
Second, greater reliance on services allows China to settle into a lower and more sustainable growth trajectory, tempering the excessive resource- and pollution-intensive activities driven by the hyper-growth of manufacturing and construction.
The advance of knowledge is often a mixed blessing.
But as the science improves, the insurance problem will have to be faced.
For many parents, nothing is more important than giving their child the best possible start in life.
Something similar could happen with other forms of genetic selection.
PRINCETON – When Radosław Sikorski, Poland’s foreign minister, went to Ukraine for talks last month, his Ukrainian counterparts reportedly laughed at him because he was wearing a Japanese quartz watch that cost only $165.
Out of nostalgia, perhaps? A full-page ad for Patek Philippe has Thierry Stern, the president of the company, saying that he listens to the chime of every watch with a minute repeater that his company makes, as his father and grandfather did before him.
The Chinese government knows what those “other ways” might be.
If I were not ignorant, I would know that children are dying from diarrhea or malaria, because they lack safe drinking water, or mosquito nets, and obviously what I have spent on this watch or handbag would have been enough to help several of them survive; but I care so little about them that I would rather spend my money on something that I wear for ostentation alone.”
It is morally better to have our goods supplied by free labor than by slaves, and to choose our goods rather than have them chosen for us by the state.
Adam Smith wrote that “consumption is the sole end and purpose of production.”
No doubt it is unfair to blame the market for bad moral choices.
Justice in distribution is supposedly secured by justice in exchange.
The market system does not guarantee this.
European governments are adamantly opposed to capital punishment – the European Union bans it outright – and some Europeans consider its use in the United States barbaric.
But, even with the limited quantitative evidence available, there are good reasons to believe that capital punishment deters.
Yet that is absolutely the wrong conclusion for anyone who believes that capital punishment deters.
Suppose it would be possible to save the life of an innocent victim by executing such a criminal.
Of course, I worry about the risk of executing the innocent.
India, Pakistan, and Israel refused to join the treaty and, over time, constructed their own atomic bombs.
The successful cheaters would most likely be authoritarian states with little transparency.
The treaty helps them to reduce fears of cheating by neighbors because it provides for inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
But this assumes perfect rationality.
Such conditions do not yet exist in a world where undemocratic states cheat on legal obligations. But the nuclear weapons states should continue to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, and refrain from new programs that suggest the prospect of their use.
What is a paradise for political scientists is a nightmare for anyone trying to rule the country in earnest.
Right and Left swapped seniority around a barely-existent central pole.
It will not die any time soon: in the Israeli aviary both doves and hawks are capable phoenixes.
Tel Aviv, who voted Livni and Left of her, should finally be able to stand up to Jerusalem, who voted Netanyahu and Right of him. This election may sound a wake-up call to the moderates, and Livni is their tested leader.
Fewer choices are sometimes the hallmark of maturity, and not only in politics.
WASHINGTON, DC – Opposition to plans to build a mosque near “Ground Zero,” the spot where the World Trade Center’s twin towers fell on September 11, 2001, comes in various shades.
A majority considered them offensive, and therefore expected interracial couples to show what is demanded today from Muslims in Manhattan: respect for other people’s sensitivities. In a nation of laws, such as the US, it is disingenuous and unfair to grant legal protection to a right – in this case the right to worship God as we see fit – and then selectively ban its exercise de facto because a majority or minority takes offense.
The real problem, however, lies elsewhere.
The other option – that US policy was in the terrorists’ crosshairs – is too upsetting for these opponents to contemplate.
Although the electoral fraud in Managua was the most widely documented, the same modus operandi occurred across the country, affecting more than 40 municipalities.
And the international community, which provides almost a third of the resources needed to make the country work, is being alienated.
Last month, the Supreme Court of Justice acquitted Alemán of the corruption charges that had sent him to prison for 20 years.
Never before in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has a state that considers itself a leader of the Arab Muslim peoples backed Israel so openly.
These tensions further receded in the tide of the “Islamization” created by the Iranian revolution, for in its wake Arabs’ sectarian identity as Sunni was pushed further into the background as a generalized “Islamic” assertiveness appeared.
Israel, the once implacable enemy of the Arab cause, now seems to be slotted into this defensive structure.
The Court must answer the following question: Can human genes – your genes – be patented? Put another way, should someone essentially be permitted to own the right, say, to test whether you have a set of genes that imply a higher than 50% probability of developing breast cancer?
Normally, economists talk about trade-offs: weaker intellectual-property rights, it is argued, would undermine incentives to innovate.
And it is why research shows that patenting genes actually reduces the production of new knowledge about genes: the most important input in the production of new knowledge is prior knowledge, to which patents inhibit access.
The WTO’s intellectual-property agreement, called TRIPS, originally foresaw the extension of “flexibilities” to the 48 least-developed countries, where average annual per capita income is below $800.
The Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama, and the Karmapa Lama are the three highest figures in Tibetan Buddhism, representing parallel institutions that have intermittently been at odds with each other throughout their history.
In fact, the Chinese-appointed Karmapa Lama has a doppelgänger Karmapa, who has set up shop in New Delhi.
China had several possible motives for staging his “escape,” including a desire to strengthen his claim to the title at a time when the rival contender (backed by important interests in India, Bhutan, and Taiwan) appeared to be gaining ground.
Nevertheless, China has refrained from attacking him, making clear that it wants him to return eventually.
The results suggest that religious and national identities are complementary, not competing, concepts.
Some may look to unpopular and unjust foreign adventures in Iraq as examples of the futility of lawful political action.
Islam’s interaction with European society sparked a flowering of knowledge, and large numbers of Muslims have inhabited the Balkans and eastern and central Europe for hundreds of years.
Any claim like that will inevitably attract attention.
But what do these arguments really mean for the outlook for investments in homes in superstar cities?
But they tend to be ingenious at developing glamorous new areas from little towns within an hour’s commute from major cities.
Finally, as Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai themselves note, even these small long-term differences in home price across cities have tended to be offset by lower rent-price ratios in the superstar cities.
A leading critic of the Kremlin and several others were hastily dragged into a police car and driven away.
For every authoritarian country that has managed to grow rapidly, there are several that have floundered.
At first sight, China seems to be an exception.
During his first term in office, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan relaxed some restrictions on Kurdish minorities and passed reforms that aligned the country’s legal regime with European norms.
And South Africa suffers from a shockingly high level of unemployment.
Bo’s rise to power owed much to his pedigree (his father was a vice premier), his political patrons, and his manipulation of the rules of the game. For example, visitors to Chongqing marvel at the soaring skyscrapers and modern infrastructure built during Bo’s tenure there.
Another common measure used to judge a Chinese official’s “merit” is his ability to deliver economic growth.
For those without guanxi, the only recourse is to purchase appointments and promotions through bribes.
In today’s inter-connected global economy, uncertainty about the US economic outlook increases one day, and Dutch consumer confidence, for example, takes a tumble the next.
It has an indirect effect on European exports to Asia, which can be sizeable because the US market is so important for Asian exports.
By pumping in whatever liquidity the financial sector needs to alleviate the credit crunch, the ECB is effectively maintaining a deflationary bias for the financial sector, whereas it has announced an inflationary bias for the rest of the economy.
But ordinary Europeans should not be fooled.
This shift is hardly surprising, given the increasing number of analyses that demonstrate that current – unilateral – climate policies will have virtually no impact on the rise in global temperature.
Such measures even include bans on light bulbs and patio heaters, tax breaks for bicycle owners, standards for tire pressure, and tests for fuel-efficient driving – none of which would appear to have much impact on the level of Russian or Middle Eastern oil imports.
It is worth noting that these outcomes are based on the optimistic reference scenario used in the US Department of Energy’s International Energy Outlook, under which renewable-energy use will grow at a higher rate than in the past.
Confronted by economic decline and rising unemployment, governments are much more likely to pay attention to domestic pressure groups than to upholding their international obligations.
Taken at face value, it seems to suggest that governments have all but abandoned their commitments to the World Trade Organization and the multilateral trade regime.
The tariff is fully consistent with a special arrangement negotiated at the time of China’s accession to the WTO, which allows the US to impose temporary protection when its markets are “disrupted” by Chinese exports.
But economists’ ideas would not have gone very far without significant changes in the underlying configuration of political interests in favor of open trade.
Unfortunately, there is little to suggest that policymakers are yet ready to confront this genuine threat.
To the extent that the Bush administration has a coherent philosophy for domestic policy, it is the idea of the “ownership society” – the belief that intermediary institutions, whether governments, unions, or the benefits departments of companies, should get out of the business of providing social insurance.
It also has people who do set up 401(k) accounts and then invest them badly – for example, Enron workers whose 401(k) money was overwhelmingly invested in company stock lost not only their jobs when the company went bankrupt, but also their pension assets.
The Myth of the Shia Crescent
Recent developments in Iraq allegedly point to a fundamental clash between Sunnis and Shiites in the region and bear witness to malevolent Iranian interferences.
Here is where Sunni-Shiite cooperation comes in.
Memories of Iraq’s eight year war of aggression against Iran in the 1980’s have not faded.
Continuous talk of a “Sunni-Shia divide” might ultimately develop into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Some issues that Europe’s decision-makers have wanted to keep under the carpet have now been rudely exposed.
But can an absence of clarity about the ECB’s voting arrangements last forever? Nout Wellink of the Dutch Central Bank has explicitly said that more disclosure would one day be needed as the ECB reaches maturity.
It is the monetary authority of a federation of sovereign states.
That could matter a lot in relation to interest-rate decisions.
And the ECB’s voting arrangements are one further element in need of reform.
For example, in a paper presented last spring at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, James Stock of Harvard University and Mark Watson of Princeton University unveiled a new “dynamic factor model,” estimated using data from 1959 to 2011.
But connections between countries do not occur solely through the direct impact of market prices.
That story might have invited some gossip outside of Greece, but it gained little purchase on international attention until the end of 2009, when the market for Greek debt started to become increasingly unsettled, with rising interest rates causing further problems for the government.
Then as now, we will not be able to understand the world economic outlook fully without considering the story on people’s minds.
Liberia’s post-conflict recovery is not unprecedented, but it provides a clear illustration of how coordinated and sustained multilateral support can help national leaders deliver impressive results.
Debt relief will open doors for the financing of critical projects in electric power, roads, and ports.
The Nation State Revisited
Many countries are currently debating the integration of migrants.
More recently, a less violent but equally worrying phenomenon has gained ground, the revival of national protectionism.
Such trends are dangerous.
But they have to be open to cooperation and coordination with others.
With advanced economies struggling to avoid financial collapse, escape recession, reduce unemployment, and restore growth, central banks are being called upon to address, sometimes simultaneously, growing imbalances.
Moreover, by pushing interest rates toward zero, the current policy of quantitative easing (increasing money supply by buying government securities) has strong, often regressive, income effects.
But this advantage does not extend to other policy areas.
The biggest challenge is that people do not always get the healthcare they need.
A Mexican survey shows that in private care, poor patients (particularly indigenous women) receive worse care than the wealthy, although there is little difference in public institutions.
Mexico has chosen a targeted insurance scheme for households that are not covered by social security scheme and are too poor to afford private insurance.
But, while an expensive campaign to combat a particularly dangerous, communicable disease like HIV/AIDS makes sense, it is less clear that this approach works well when aimed at providing the public with general, health-related information.
Even without detailed cost-benefit analysis, it is clear that universal insurance coverage is vital.
Moreover, only a small portion of the liquidity created by unconventional monetary policy has been channeled toward households and the small and medium-size enterprises that generate most new jobs.
Furthermore, the effect of internationally agreed regulatory reforms – most of which have yet to be implemented – will be to increase banks’ capital requirements while shrinking the scale of maturity transformation risks that they can carry on their balance sheets.
Such an approach is the only way to place the global economy’s recovery on a sustainable footing.
This has been the purpose of the vast bank bailouts in the US and Europe, followed by several rounds of “quantitative easing,” by which central banks print money and pump it into the banking system through a variety of unorthodox channels.
So the question arises: Why did people want to borrow so much? Why did the ratio of household debt to income soar to unprecedented heights in the pre-recession days?
Of course, some worried about the collapse of the household savings rate, but few were overly concerned.
Concerted redistribution of wealth and income has frequently been essential to the long-term survival of capitalism.
China, which has never adopted legally binding limits on its nuclear weapons or strategic nuclear-delivery vehicles, rejects Russia’s call to join negotiations – a stance that the US supports until the Russian and US nuclear arsenals move closer in size to those of China.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to initiating a trilateral dialogue is Chinese resistance to formal nuclear arms-control agreements, which is rooted in the memory of Cold War-era nonproliferation initiatives aimed partly at preventing China from developing its own nuclear deterrent.
With Russia ostensibly on board, it is up to the US to initiate a transformation in the nuclear-negotiation framework – and that means convincing China to participate.
Turkey’s government was no better at anticipating the changes in the Arab world than were local regimes and Western powers.
This time, however, it is modernity, not exoticism, that is the source of fascination.
Turkey is also much less worried about its future than Israel is.
Turkey is for Europe, beyond its demography, “a principle of energy” and a cure for pessimism – even if, as Erdoğan is showing, self-confidence can easily turn into hubris.
From 17th c. onwards often applied to delusive commercial or financial schemes.”
That seems to be the core of the meaning of the word as it is most consistently used.
It would seem more accurate to refer to these episodes as speculative epidemics.
The New Age Divide
At the same time, people are living longer, so that in a generation the number of elderly dependents in some countries will outgrow that of the young.
It took radio 38 years to reach an audience of 50 million. Facebook did that in two years.
But continuing to use energy inefficiently will not mitigate the painful effects of the global economic crisis.
This year’s task may be to reach a global understanding in Copenhagen that is not too prescriptive, but which is more than aspirational and into which an American domestic political agreement can be incorporated once Obama achieves it.
According to Morgan Stanley, SWF’s are expected to manage $12 trillion by 2015, up from about $2.5 trillion today.
So central banks are transferring their excess reserves to existing or newly created SWF’s, which in turn invest in high-return equities.
Some worry about reciprocity: if Chinese firms are allowed to invest in US and EU firms, shouldn’t US and EU firms be allowed to invest freely in any Chinese firm?
SWF’s are, it seems, here to stay and grow, and they do offer significant benefits.
Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom and make their own way.”
To explain what is wrong with the new Bush doctrine, I have to invoke the concept of open society.
This has left the US not only deeply divided, but also at loggerheads with much of the rest of the world, which considers our policies high-handed and arbitrary.
America cannot do whatever it wants, as the Iraqi debacle has demonstrated; but, at the same time, nothing much can be achieved in the way of international cooperation without US leadership, or at least active participation.
As the head of the PBOC, he has favored more market-based monetary policies and increased internationalization of China’s currency, the renminbi.
He has recently been promoted to the post of Deputy Director of the National Development and Reform Commission, the principal body that advises the State Council on economic-development strategy and macroeconomic policy.
If China wanted to continue to invest in foreign businesses and natural resources, it would have to become a net seller of bonds from its portfolio.
I was at a dinner the other night with Yale World Fellows, a carefully selected group of professionals, representing every major country of the world, who spend a semester here.
When Merton engaged people in conversation, any topic would remind the cosmopolitan influentials of the world at large, while local influentials were reminded of things in their own town.
What I find particularly striking is the sense of loyalty developing among cosmopolitans.
The cosmopolitans have shared experiences: they are directly communicating with each other across the globe.
The New Face of the United Nations
This balanced approach is important because most of the world’s hotspots are in trouble not only, or even mainly, because of politics, but because of the underlying challenges of hunger, disease, and environmental crisis.
Three treaties emerged in 1992 out of the so-called Rio Conference on the Environment – on climate change, biodiversity conservation, and desertification.
If the United States works more closely within the UN framework, it will find willing partners in the rising Asian powers, which are intent on using their influence and resources to solve today’s challenges.
The hijab, the headscarf that some Muslim women wear, is already banned in French public schools, where the “ostentatious” display of any religious symbolism is forbidden.
Aside from the fact that more serious issues face the French government than the sartorial habits of a small number of women, there is the matter of individual freedom.
The Egyptian imam, Sheikh Mohammed Tantawi, wants to ban the wearing of face-covering veils in Egyptian schools. But this is still no reason why French women should not be allowed to enter a post office, a bank, a school, or any other public place in a burqa.
But one can impose dress codes for certain jobs, without banning a type of clothing for everyone.
All we see, as she looks out of the window, are her eyes, nicely framed in mascara.
But, regardless of how these immediate challenges are resolved, it is clear that the world economy is entering a difficult new longer-term phase as well – one that will be substantially less hospitable to economic growth than possibly any other period since the end of World War II.
It is an environment that will produce deep disparities in economic performance around the world.
But they have not prevented a borrowing binge in their private sectors.
But they provide the arenas of consultation, cooperation, and give-and-take among opposing social groups that are crucial in times of turbulence and shocks.
There are, of course, specific, identifiable dangers, but what worries us most about terrorism, for example, is its unpredictable nature.
This is the context of our current peculiar vulnerability. What used to protect us (distance, government intervention, foresight, classic defense methods) has been weakened, and now offers little or no protection.
We cannot continue to pursue strategies that ignore our common exposure to global risks, and the resulting environment of mutual dependence.
More concessional finance will be available for low-income countries, and international liquidity will be increased by a hand-out of $ 250 billion in special drawing rights (SDRs).
The ‘new’ IMF should be an institution that communicates better with its members, balances the interests of its advanced, emerging and developing members in an evenhanded manner, and aligns its policies better to the needs of the moment.
First, the US saving deficit will need to be addressed in a sustainable manner.
The rapid growth of China, India, and other emerging countries should come with increased influence, to be implemented through the planned quota increase in 2011.
This regional realignment is typified by the emergence of a de facto alliance that dare not speak its name.
Since the Wahhabis consider the Shi’a apostates, the challenge from the Shi’a – both within and without Saudi Arabia – represents a mortal threat.
This leads to an unavoidable dilemma: Bush will have to choose between supporting democracy and backing those who want to fight Islamic radicalism.
One is to have an international conference at which experts can suggest models to calculate exchange rates and politicians can negotiate deals.
There have been two models for such a consensus.
Many Europeans tried to argue in recent years that monetary policy should also take asset-price developments into account, whereas American policymakers and academics largely resisted this approach.
But, from an early stage, the transparency that resulted from the early publication of who voted for and against rate increases led to a public identification of members of the Committee as hawks or doves.
And nowhere does this seem truer than in Latin America.
India is showing keen interest in the region’s energy industry, and has signed export agreements in the defense sector.
The US not only encouraged these changes, but has benefited hugely from them.
Trade relations provide another all-important lever.
But which issues will dominate 2013? In no small part, as the French are fond of saying, plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.
Civil war along sectarian lines could well predominate, or fighting between the various anti-Assad opposition groups could erupt.
At the same time, sanctions that have been imposed by a substantial set of countries are taking a significant toll on the Iranian economy.
The New Public Diplomacy
Skeptics who treat the term “public diplomacy” as a mere euphemism for propaganda miss the point.
The third dimension of public diplomacy is the development of lasting relationships with key individuals over many years or even decades, through scholarships, exchanges, training, seminars, conferences, and access to media channels.
The main strength of the mass-media approach is its audience reach and ability to generate public awareness and set the agenda.
The evolution of public diplomacy from one-way communications to a two-way dialogue treats publics as co-creators of meaning and communication.
In the United States, big bonuses given to executives from firms receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts – the insurance giant AIG, in particular – has infuriated public opinion, with a populist press and Congress fueling popular rage.
But it seems obvious that increasing economic inequality in the US and, indeed, throughout the OECD, has stoked a perception of injustice and growing anger.
This sense of injustice is only partly contained by political considerations in the US, thanks to the “Obama factor,” a rare phenomenon that can be described as the restoration of trust in one’s political leaders.
WASHINGTON, DC – Senator Barack Obama’s recent European tour hints that the Illinois senator is Europe’s choice to be America’s next president.
In other words, from this perspective, the world’s two richest and most powerful economic spaces, the European Union and the US, are bound to be rivals, even when they are allies.
While America’s invasion of Afghanistan was widely seen as justified, the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq produced an open break between the US and its two major continental allies, France and Germany, which were supported by Russia and China.
It is difficult to know where this uneasy transatlantic détente of 2008 will lead.
Of course, America’s definitions of its role in the world may change.
That Europe can find the will, the means, and the confidence to play that role cannot be taken for granted.
Have the British, French, and even Israelis become armed extensions of the US in their respective spheres of influence?
Is it worth fighting for a world that cannot be saved, and that only invites murky, inconclusive entanglements?
Likewise, delegating security to allies can have perverse psychological effects.
The Measurement of Hope
Though I am an optimist, I am not blind to the problems that we face, or to the challenges that we must overcome to accelerate progress in the next 15 years.
Unless voters hear about the positive impact that their generosity is having, they will inevitably focus on issues closer to home.
The MDGs were coherent because they focused on helping the poorest people in the world.
The information revolution is transforming politics and organizations.
Sometimes people are attracted to others with command power by myths of invincibility.
Certainly, the hard power of military and police force was necessary to counter al-Qaeda, but the indiscriminate use of hard power – illustrated by the invasion of Iraq, the Abu Ghraib prison photos, and detentions without trial – served to increase the number of terrorist recruits.
Indeed, psychologists have found that too much assertiveness by a leader worsens relationships, just as too little limits achievement.
And, in an age of flatter hierarchies and empowered knowledge workers, soft power is likely to increase in importance.
The Bush administration has finally come around to doing what every economist urged it to do: put more equity into the banks.
Remarkable as it may seem, America, for all its problems, is still seen as the safest place to put one’s money.
At the time, many thought that such lofty appeals were a deliberate attempt to forestall real reform: those who had done well under the old system knew that the crisis would pass, and with it, so too would the demand for reform.
The Next IMF
The IMF’s management shares many strategic considerations repeatedly raised by the Bundesbank, which has argued that the Fund should limit its activities to its core mandate: promoting monetary and financial stability.
Indeed, the implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief initiated by the G-8 already provides an unprecedented opportunity to complete the process of debt relief for a large number of low-income countries.
This argument is based on the idea that business does not like change, and in particular does not like change brought about by government policy or regulation.
New businesses are already emerging all over the world, focused on low-carbon solutions to energy generation and use, from light bulbs to transport, but they are still at the pioneering stage.
2.      A clear commitment to the global pricing of carbon that allows businesses to invest with confidence and at the scale required.
Dwight D. Eisenhower invited Nikita Khrushchev to the United States in 1959 to open the eyes of the first Soviet leader ever to visit America.
The US should press for bilateral talks. One lesson provided by former American presidents is the value of direct, high-level contacts with key adversaries.
These parallel steps would reshape the process to achieve a key US objective: ensuring that Iran abides by Khamenei’s own fatwa (religious decree) against nuclear weapons.
To organize discussion of these broader issues, the US and others should explore the possibility of appointing a special envoy – perhaps a former Chief of State under UN auspices – to engage Iran in new ways.
From today’s perspective, the problems of the Nixon era look relatively manageable, even trivial.
Germany was more obliging in the face of US pressure, mainly because its security relied on America’s military presence.
What can they do?”
After an initial inflationary surge, American economic growth fell off sharply in the 1970’s.
Instead of leading to an American renaissance, the “Nixon shock” produced theories about American imperial overstretch and decline.
But, from the start, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the physics and chemistry prizes, and the Caroline Institute, which awards those for medicine/physiology, have based their decisions on the recommendations of their respective committees.
Conversely, the Academy of Sciences sometimes rebelled against its committees.
The Nobel bylaws do not allow splitting a prize into more than three parts, thereby excluding discoveries that entailed work by more than three researchers, or omitting key persons who equally deserved to share in the honor.
Is science or society well served by a fixation on prizes and on nurturing a culture of extreme competition? Perhaps once the mystery of the Nobel Prize is reduced, we might reflect on what is truly significant in science.
A worldwide effort is needed to understand changes in all parts of the world.
The IPCC faced down these vested interests.
Second, we should initiate IPCC-like scientific processes for other global challenges, including the global loss of biodiversity, desertification, and over-fishing of the oceans.
Nothing extraordinary has been revealed, but the cables now available allow readers and analysts to draw some preliminary conclusions about the Obama administration’s views of the region; about Latin American leaders’ attitudes toward the United States; and about the quality of US diplomatic and intelligence-gathering activities in the hemisphere.
Another good example of interesting and competent reporting lies in the cable sent from La Paz, Bolivia on March 30, 2006, by Ambassador David Greenlee, highlighting the tensions between the Cuban and Venezuelan advisers and security personnel surrounding President Evo Morales, as well as the circles of elites around him.
He then describes the utter lack of cooperation between intelligence agencies and the military, because many US and Mexican officials fear that whatever information they share with the army will be handed over to the cartels.
Nigeria, which is giving Taylor sanctuary, is obliged to turn him over to the Special Court for Sierra Leone, created by the United Nations in 2003 to prosecute those responsible for the bloodletting in West Africa’s in the 1990’s.
The women and children whose limbs Taylor ordered to be hacked off bear testimony to his brutality, and the countries left in turmoil make clear that there can be no durable peace in West Africa unless the man who unleashed these conflicts is stopped.
The best containment strategy is to put Taylor in the custody of the Special Court that indicted him in 2003 for war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the war in Sierra Leone.
Its just concluded sixth congress was held for the first time in the occupied territories, which meant that former guerrillas from Lebanon and Jordan were allowed entry by Israel.
Backroom decisions and top-down guidance was replaced by a democratic free-for-all that saw many of Fatah’s historic leaders fall to the wayside, making room for younger, locally popular leaders.
Some are calling for Fatah leaders to abstain from ministerial roles, whereas others see no reason why one can’t be a leader of a party and the government simultaneously.
Nevertheless, the results of the Sixth Fatah Congress reflect a clear bias in favor of becoming a party rather than an armed resistance movement.
The recent WikiLeaks disclosures of classified American diplomatic documents, for example, suggest that North Korea has been helping Iran with its advanced missile program.
Starting from similar levels a half-century ago, South Korea has grown to become one of the world’s most prosperous economies, with nearly 50 million people enjoying a per capita income of $30,000 (at purchasing price parity).
China has tried to persuade Kim’s regime to follow its market-oriented example, but Kim is afraid that an economic opening would lead to a political opening and loss of dictatorial control.
If so, the risky behavior we have seen recently is part of the process of solidifying a unique political system: a hereditary Communist monarchy.
The nature and content of that treaty were purely diplomatic.
But Antarctica had one great advantage, as compared to the Arctic, which is now in peril: there were only penguins in Antarctica, not voters, especially voters of different nationalities.
This poses a real threat to the Eskimo and Inuit populations, as well as to polar bears.
The good news for Ban Ki-moon is that he has become Secretary General of the United Nations at a time when the prospects for conflict between or among the world’s great powers – the United States, China, Japan, Russia, Europe, and India – are remote.
When they are willing and able to do so, the UN can make a difference; when they are not, the UN can act in only the most limited way, if at all, regardless of what the Secretary General wants.
Again, what is holding the UN back is not the UN itself, but its leading members, who cannot agree on what change is needed.
All these suggestions highlight what might be any secretary general’s most important asset: his voice.
Syria’s Chemical Genie
Fortunately, Syria does not face these threats today. But Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran – all potentially unstable countries with growing nuclear enterprises – may in the future.
The United States, which has become the world’s leader in containing the chemical-weapons risk, seems befuddled.
But, to rely on the US government alone to plot the most effective strategy in the shadow of possible internal group-think is asking too much.
But the emerging Obama doctrine suggests that “elections alone do not make true democracy,” and that, as has been the case in the Arab world, any abrupt move to democracy is bound to produce chaos.
Why should the West insist on elections in a country that since 1984 was ruled by a Western-backed dictator, Lansana Conté, who himself came to power in a military coup? He maintained a constitution, and held elections, but this did not make him a democratic ruler, nor was he able to extricate his country from appalling backwardness despite its tremendous potential for economic development.
For as it does, China is using its colossal financial firepower to expand its strategic position on the continent, without linking aid and investment to pesky demands for good governance.
Are they right?
His worldview was shaped by the fact that he spent part of his youth in Indonesia and had an African father.
This was demonstrated by his appointments of experienced advisers, careful management of issues, and above all, keen contextual intelligence.
Obama has not bent the arc of history in the transformational way to which he aspired in his campaign four years ago, but his shift to a pragmatic approach may turn out to be a good thing, particularly if voters continue to have doubts about the economy.
How is it that America gives us Silicon Valley wizardry and Third World infrastructure?
House prices remain pretty flat.
Prime Minister Gordon Brown is sustained in office primarily by the calculation of his ministers that getting rid of him would trigger an early election that they would lose heavily.
First, what happens if politics does not trump economics, and Obama’s policies don’t start to produce a recovery? That is when the old political calculus may take its grim toll.
The world needs one. But it needs one who continues to shine brightly for several years to come.
More than anything else, his success in this domain will determine the perception of his administration.
This means that he will have to deal with a large number of threats, vulnerabilities, and independent actors who may resist bending to America’s will.
Once the fighting between Israel and Hamas subsides, the question of what the Arab states will do to strengthen Palestinian moderates and to make peace with Israel is sure to arise.
But, as we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, we should ask ourselves: is it really wise to accord such importance to growth?
Thus, policies that promote individual well-being tend to benefit society as well.
Many questions remain unexplored, some studies lack sufficient confirmatory evidence, and still others, like those involving the effects of economic growth, have yielded conflicting results.
Annual GDP growth in the first quarter has been revised upward, to 4.1%, exceeding market expectations and providing a strong indication that the Japanese economy is finally recovering, after two decades of stagnation.

In particular, there was a sudden increase in exports via the free-trade zone in Guangdong.
The US economy’s road to recovery is being built on the shale-gas revolution, a revived manufacturing sector, and a decline in the US budget deficit in GDP terms.
As more of China’s population converges to Western standards of consumption, demand for commodities – and thus their prices – will remain on an upward trajectory.
There is also the issue of the so-called reserve price (the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service).
Around the world, governments are taking greater control of resources and imposing policies that hamper global production and ultimately force prices higher.
A New Greek Test for Europe
The hope was that the Greeks would ultimately bear their own burden.
Some analysts argue that, given guarantees of debt incurred by public corporations, the Greek government’s obligations are even higher.
Despite domestic opposition, German Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to commit to keeping Greece in the eurozone, because the risk that a Greek exit would precipitate the monetary union’s disintegration was deemed too great.
The Europe that emerges from it could look, for better or worse, very different from the Europe of today.
Today, some community college students have to quit school because their textbooks cost more than their tuition; and today, some third graders have to share math texts because there aren’t enough to go around.
The new development and distribution models promoted by the Open Education movement represent a natural and inevitable evolution of the educational publishing industry.
Together, we can help make the dream of Open Education a reality.
Think of the productivity cost of millions like him having to adjust to a new system.
Why buy a Windows machine when all your colleagues will own Macintoshes and can help you on them but not Windows, and when all the independent software developers will be programming for the Mac’s new Leopard operating system?
After all, even though Microsoft has a monopoly of primary sales of its software, copies sold in 2007 compete with those sold in 2006.
The Opportunity in Seoul
There are already some serious signs of distress – the currency war between the United States and China, and its spread to other countries, being a case in point.
Thus, the first task for the G-20 meeting on November 11-12 in Seoul must be to revitalize and strengthen the IMF and global financial regulation.
These two issues may or may not be on the table for further discussion in Seoul.
After five years of an average annual economic growth of 9%, economic claims are strikingly absent, as are all socialist and even social demands.
Ordinary Ukrainians aspire to law and order; businessmen want their playing field to be leveled with the richest and most well connected.
Ukraine has little choice but to turn to Europe and the West.
Otherwise, financial destabilization will threaten the fortunes of the very rich.
The Algerian Tragedy
Algeria was the first Arab Spring country.
But opposition figures, former Algerian intelligence officers, and diplomats accused the military of being complicit or even directly responsible for others.
AQI not only failed to embed itself in the local context, but had begun eliminating local opponents, fueling a revolt against it by Sunni militias in 2007.
But this picture, based on Africa’s most corrupt regimes, is unfair and misleading – like claiming that all Europeans are guilty of “ethnic cleansing” because of what happened in the former Yugoslavia.
We look at almost a hundred indicators and define governance in a new way – as the public goods and services that should be provided to citizens.
Africa, with its huge and often untapped markets, must follow the same path.
Moreover, while the international community is quick to pounce on African leaders for governance failures, it seems less enthusiastic about examining its role in the flight of African assets.
But those problems should not be allowed to obscure the continent’s many success stories – much less to be defined as Africa’s alone.
The number of people living on less than $1.25 a day increased from 549 million in 1981 to 595 million in 2005.
The leading regions have experienced rapid growth.
What can be done? There is no universal “fix” in economic development, and pluralism of approaches has great value.
For example, the gains from labor mobility have not been equally sharedbetween educated and uneducated migrants.
First, empirical evidence shows that convergence of per capita income between lagging and leading regions is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for achieving poverty reduction and social convergence.
Although the two youthful revolts were undertaken by the same generation and took similar forms of street demonstrations and sit-ins, there were far more differences than similarities as students rebelled on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
That same spring, demonstrators in Paris burned cars in opposition to the bourgeois lifestyle.
In violation of a centuries-long tradition of university autonomy, the police marched onto campus, beat up students, and arrested a large number of demonstrators.
After 1968, Western student protestors gradually entered their countries’ political and intellectual establishments.
The Solidarity movement of the 1980’s and the peaceful overthrow of communism was, in large measure, the work of their generation.
Palestinian negotiators have always had to balance three issues: historic rights, current realities, and the price of using their negative power.
They argue that the positions acceptable in Taba (following the failure of Camp David II) must be the basis of any agreement, and that what needs to be negotiated now is the timetable for implementation.
But now it is time for a clear-eyed assessment of what lies before Palestinians, Israelis, and, perhaps more importantly, for the wider Arab world.
Indeed, Abbas is now the only Arab leader who came to power in a more or less free election.
The Palestinians have shown that it is not true that an Arab society cannot progress towards representative institutions.
A ruling by Poland’s Constitutional Court issued on May 11 gutted much of the lustration law, and made Germek’s position in the EU parliament safe – at least for now.
Solidarity adopted a philosophy of compromise rather than revenge, and embraced the idea of a Poland for everyone rather than a state divided between omnipotent winners and oppressed losers.
The Solidarity workers at giant enterprises have become victims of the freedoms they won.
The means chosen by these losers’ parties after they won the general election of 2005 was a great purge.
If a hunt for agents had been organized in 1990 when the democratic revolution began, neither Leszek Balcerowicz’s economic reforms nor the establishment of a state governed by law would have been possible.
It is time for Europe to adjust the way that it thinks about nationality, cultural roots, and how it deals with immigrants.
I suppose that I belong to an expat generation that has not been educated to consider voting an essential right, if not a duty, and I regret that.
Among his achievements is a Citizens’ Charter that is handed to every new resident to explain Swiss participatory democracy and lay out its rules.
The Prion Puzzle
The resulting epizootic (animal epidemic) affected more than 280,000 cows.
Since then, “new variant” Creutzfeltdt-Jakob disease has claimed roughly 300 lives.
Moreover, there is hope that an effective vaccination can be developed.
Using recently developed “zinc finger nuclease” technology, any given gene can be removed from an animal’s DNA.
While even a shrewd economist like the former US Federal Reserve Board member Alan Blinder thought this, it is not likely for several reasons, both “natural” and manmade.
Thus, foreign radiologists need US certification before they are allowed to read the x-rays sent from the US. Until recently, only two foreign firms qualified.
Senator Barbara Boxer railed continually against Carly Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, that she had exported 35,000 jobs. The obvious reply should have been: “Yes, I outsourced 30,000 jobs.
New York – The selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain’s running mate hit the United States like an electric storm.
Their more affluent peers hire women like them to do the dirty work, or else they have had to deal with stagnant minimum-wage pay in the US labor market’s “pink-collar” or service-industry ghetto.
When you’ve been making the coffee forever, it’s nice to imagine leading the free world.
In becoming the poster girl for a re-branded continuation of the Bush administration, Palin is showing herself to have much in common with glossy faux-populists like Eva Peron or Denmark’s anti-immigrant leader Pia Kjærsgaard.
There seemed every chance that he would apply this approach to the choice of his running mate.
Questions about her record have been sidestepped; her inexperience is lauded as a virtue; any criticism is dismissed as sexism.
He was arguing as Wall Street went into meltdown that the American economy’s fundamentals were still strong.
His opponent originally derided what has rapidly become the conventional wisdom.
What struck me, thinking back to the days I once spent in Northern Ireland, was how both there and here the crucible of so much struggle, bitterness, and bloodshed is very small.  There is an intimacy about the geography of Northern Ireland, Gaza, and the West Bank that makes the violence seem all the more inexplicable and obscene.
This was not a matter of theology or even liturgy.
The result of that deal has been years of peace.
So did I think of lessons to be learned in the Middle East as I drove from one end of Jordan to the other?
These studies led to the suggestion that the use of paracetamol may represent an important risk factor in the development of asthma.
This suggests that the potential effect of paracetamol is not restricted to the airways and may affect a number of organ systems.
Pending the results of such research, paracetamol remains the preferred drug to relieve pain and fever in childhood, to be used in accordance with WHO guidelines, which recommend that it should be reserved for children with a high fever (38.5Co or above).
According to Newton’s third law of motion, “for every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction.”
In fact, China should hope that no such apology is forthcoming.
When US global dominance was unquestioned, as in the 1990’s, it made sense for Israel to secure its long-term future by maintaining a stranglehold over the US Congress.
So time is no longer on Israel’s side.
An old saying in politics in Moscow is that relations between the United States and Russia are always better when a Republican rules in the White House.
Not only is Russia building a civilian nuclear reactor in Iran, thereby helping to advance Iranian knowledge of the nuclear process; it is also reluctant to support efforts by the United Nations Security Council to press Iran not to develop nuclear weapons.
Consider the words of Vitaly Tretyakov, the editor of the weekly Moscow News , on the recent US elections.
So we should limit them, right? For health reasons, yes, we should indeed do that; but, paradoxically, limiting such emissions would cause global warming to increase.
Lowering the level of black particles in the atmosphere would benefit both human health and the climate.
However, this is probably not a viable alternative.
The clearest sign that the boom is ending is the IMF’s forecast of 1.5% growth for the US in 2008.
Thus, the world cannot help but be pulled down by a US slump.
The mortgage-backed securities that US banks succeeded in selling to the world are not comparable to European assets with similar names.
Indeed, adjusted for inflation, the dollar is now nearly as low against the euro as it was against the deutschmark in 1992, when German unification resulted in the breakdown of the European currency system.
True, the US Federal Reserve has tried to prevent a recession by cutting its interest rates. But the Fed cannot endow the banks with new equity capital and prevent a credit crunch.
“Big Blue” (as IBM is known) allowed other companies (notably the infant Microsoft) to develop its software.
But this initial triumph of the PC (and very substantial sales in the 1980’s) did not immediately fulfill all the initial hopes for individual empowerment and social transformation.
The potential was alluring, but also terrifying.
But the alleged obsolescence of the PC is actually a sign of how basic it has become to a new vision of society.
Netanyahu’s response to Obama’s initiative signaled what has been apparent for some time: the complex regional process known as the Arab Spring, and the eve of a US presidential election year, are difficult circumstances in which to try to re-start the peace process.
New Arab leaders will struggle mightily with the public’s rising expectations, and their willingness to get behind a peace process will take a backseat to that struggle.
But the absence of a peace process could encourage its return.
Indeed, Yeltsin was fearless, and sought not his personal survival, but the survival of the democratic idea that he introduced to Russia.
Putin, by contrast, seems incapable of recognizing and admitting his mistakes, and persists in a policy long after its failure is visible to the world.
Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s arrest and trial were orchestrated for precisely this reason.
This is one reason why Russia has become so aggressive with its neighbors, Ukraine and Georgia, and seeks to maintain a military presence in places like Transdniestria, the breakaway region of Moldova.
Other advanced economies or emerging markets (the rest of the euro zone; New Zealand, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, and some Southeast European economies) are also nearing a recessionary hard landing.
Japan used to grow modestly for two reasons: strong exports to the US and a weak yen.
Countries that allowed their currencies to appreciate relative to the dollar will experience a sharp slowdown in export growth.
The paradox of today’s quest for energy independence is that pursuing it actually increases energy insecurity. However much politicians who call for energy independence might prefer it otherwise, the market has chosen oil as a staple energy source.
After all, a collapse in oil prices would be a death sentence for several new energy technologies, and, not incidentally, would increase demand for oil.
Would politicians, with their perpetual fascination with “independence,” attempt to eliminate dependence one commodity at a time? Put another way, would the cause of “energy independence” seek to reverse globalization?
This theory went strongly against conventional wisdom.
But I kept at it, and, step by step, addressed different key issues – such as biocompatibility, manufacturing, reproducibility of release, and bioactivity.
As a proof of principle, we decided to synthesize a new family of biodegradable polymers, called polyanhydrides, for medical use.
We returned the proposal for another review; it came back with the comment that the polymers were fragile and would break.
Scientists throughout history have often had to fight conventional wisdom to validate their discoveries.
Often the choice depends less on a rational assessment of similarities and differences than on gut feelings, proclivities to optimism or pessimism, or political orientation.
There are modern parallels.
This nationalist-minded rhetoric has returned in the financial crisis of 2007.
In those panics, financial innovation caused uncertainty and nervousness, but also induced an important and beneficial learning process.
Indeed, failure to reach a settlement in the past was not the result of bad faith, or inadequate negotiating skills.
But, notwithstanding the damage that the Palestinian strategy is inflicting on Israel’s increasingly fragile international standing, Abbas might be embarking on what could turn out to be a self-defeating diplomatic exercise.
Any government that recognizes the Palestinian state would inevitably view that act as the end of the peace process, and neither Europe nor the US would include in the package any acknowledgement of the Palestinian right of return to areas lost to Israel in 1948.
A plan that almost certainly would have to satisfy Israel’s security concerns and lean toward acknowledging its Jewishness – in a way that might entirely neutralize the Palestinian ethos of return – would be especially unpalatable to them.
Those who said that there would be no downturn, or that recovery would be rapid, or that the economy’s real problems were structural, or that supporting the economy would produce inflation (or high short-term interest rates), or that immediate fiscal austerity would be expansionary were wrong. Not just a little wrong.
The first is the failure of central banks to adopt a rule like nominal GDP targeting or its equivalent.
But, in July 2011, the ten-year US Treasury bond rate crashed to 2%, and it was below 1.5% at the start of June.
At the center of the first narrative, preferred by financial-sector executives, is the view that all necessary reforms have already been adopted (or soon will be).
(I serve on the FDIC’s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee; all views stated here are my own.)
As Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, put it recently, using the delicate language of central bankers, “The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled.
And, when things go badly, it becomes the taxpayers’ problem (or the problem of some foreign government and their taxpayers).
But if many people start to doubt Italy’s solvency and require a large premium to lend, the country’s fiscal deficit will worsen, and it will most likely default.
As in many wars, a staged escalation in a financial crisis often leads to the worst possible outcome: a defeat with large losses.
In the meantime, Italy is sinking.
To act, politicians need consensus, which often does not emerge until the costs of inaction have become highly visible.
Trapped between the possible and the necessary, Israelis and Palestinians simply learned to live without a solution.
The two-state solution is rapidly losing its appeal.
Jordanians of the caliber of Former Prime Ministers Abdelsalam Al-Majali and Taher al-Masri, as well as a former adviser of King Hussein, Adnan Abu-Odeh, have been advancing schemes for a Jordanian-Palestinian solution.
On December 10, Edmund Phelps, my colleague at Columbia University, received the Nobel Prize in economics for 2006. The award was long overdue.
As a practical matter, even controlling for expectations (as Phelps’ work insists that we do), the relationship between unemployment and inflation is highly unstable.
Nor is there evidence that inflation, should it increase slightly, cannot be reversed at a relatively minor cost – comparable to the benefits of additional employment and growth enjoyed in the excessive expansion of the economy that led to the increase in inflation.
But it is a misuse of that analysis to conclude that nothing can be done about unemployment, or that monetary authorities should focus exclusively on inflation.
The Philippines’ Sanctuaries of Terror
Veterans of the Mindanao camps took part in almost every JI-linked bombing since 2000, including the attack that killed hundreds in Bali in 2002.
It enjoys popular support, expresses legitimate grievances, and peace talks are underway.
So what is to be done? American forces are probing the sanctuaries in the guise of training exercises, and they are backing targeted air strikes.
The Filipino armed forces must be better equipped to close down any remaining terrorist sanctuaries – and keep them closed.
Many books have recently documented the games played by the climate-change deniers.   Merchants of Doubt , a new book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway set for release in mid-2010, will be an authoritative account of their misbehavior.
The first was the hacking of a climate-change research center in England.
In other words, their arguments were systematic and contrived, not at all original to the circumstances.
It is our responsibility to listen, to understand the message, and then to act.
These pirates currently hold more than a dozen ships hostage in Somali ports.
The Canadian naval mission ends in late October, and no country has stepped forward to replace it.
There is a clear way to begin.
Moreover, illegal fishing operations are known to subject people aboard pirate ships to unsafe and unfair working conditions at sea.
Because fish and other ocean wildlife do not stay within national boundaries, international cooperation is essential to the long-term health of the world’s oceans and the sustainability of fisheries and fishing jobs.
As allies, the US and Europe are taking a major step forward to end the scourge of pirate fishing.
Instead, European law requires an individual determination that deportation is necessary and proportionate to the crime committed, as well as consideration of other circumstances (such as the strength of the individual’s ties to the community).
Primary responsibility for safeguarding the rights and well-being of all citizens lies with EU member states.
The divide is physical, not just mental.
Europe’s Political Stress Tests
Moreover, its poll numbers continue to climb.
Similarly, Portugal’s center-right Social Democratic Party has pushed a tough pro-austerity line, including tax hikes and spending cuts, since coming to power in 2011.
Alternatively, citizens could try to lead efforts to re-negotiate their countries’ constitutional arrangements.
The euro has strengthened by nearly 10% against the dollar since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi vowed on July 26 to do “whatever it takes” to hold the currency together.
With the ESM and ECB capping interest rates on government bonds, countries will have as much time as they need – and they will need plenty – to reduce their debt burdens to manageable levels.
In their October 18 communiqué, eurozone leaders stated in no uncertain terms that they are not prepared to go there.
Even in Greece, where conditions are the worst, Golden Dawn is still a minority party.
This description of stock markets in emerging countries is not wrong, just biased, because the same description applies to stock markets in advanced countries.
Political interference in the stock market is not merely about taxes on capital gains, dividends, and income.
Of course, this was publicly justified in terms of stimulating the economy, not supporting the stock market.
But one should be clear about what one is forecasting. Essentially, one is forecasting not just economics, but politics - and even the cultural values - that shape economic policies and performance.
By asking whichever senior officials she saw to pass on her gift and her best wishes to Zhao, the Chinese leadership would understand that the outside world was still thinking of him and wanted to ensure his survival.
No one in government would be in any doubt about what she wanted to do.
It could have gone terribly wrong, bringing down her and her administration.
She regarded ideas as the very core of politics, and she battled for those that she held.
Extreme poverty breeds apathy, not rebellion.
People reacted in a variety of ways.
But they soon discovered that realizing this prospect would require a longer and more arduous journey than they had anticipated.
Seductive leaders (Hitler among them) exploited the resulting sense of frustration.
Such inequalities exist, to varying degrees, in all developed countries.
This view naturally underpins interventions like targeted smoking-cessation services or health-education initiatives.
After all, some potential solutions are politically easier to implement within existing systems than others.
The Politics of Revolutionary Surprise
Longtime regime opponents, too, were caught off guard.
As it turned out, by the time the seriousness of the rebellion became clear, fear was already changing sides even within the halls of Tunisian power.
In Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen, no one knows where power will lie in the months to come.
The Arab street has changed the calculus of fear not only in the countries that have witnessed major protests, but also in the rest of the Arab world, where rulers are on notice that discontent need not remain submerged forever.
All this resolve was shattered by revelations about Toledo's personal advisor, César Almeyda, whom he appointed to head the new National Intelligence Board.
Despite this, he brims with imagined presidential plans, such as ridding the country of terrorist groups like Shining Path and re-establishing Peru's economic standing.
But he stubbornly refused, and his belated admission came too late to gain public favor.
The Politics of Values
More than that, the divisions are reproduced at the local level.
When he speaks of “modernization,” or of “bringing things into the twenty-first century,” he manages to suggest a strange but appealing mixture of change and stability.
A pacifist streak of values is also unmistakable in Europe.
The Post-Nuclear Transition
German energy policy now depends once more on the future deployment of renewable energy sources.
Over the past decade, 370,000 new jobs have been created in the sector, and exports of renewable-energy technology are rising rapidly, totaling roughly €30 billion from 2006 to 2008.
In Europe, the number of nuclear plants is declining, as old plants are decommissioned and public opinion in even traditionally pro-nuclear countries like France begins to shift: almost two-thirds of the French now believe that nuclear power stands in the way of an increase in renewable energy.
Given the precision required to operate on an organ as delicate as the brain, the convergence of mechanical technologies with the art of surgery catalyzed progress in the field.
Because the human brain makes decisions based on sensory input – and, of course, experience – such data are essential for the surgeon to make the most informed choices possible during surgery.
Surgeons operating manually know how much force they exert only by the way it feels; a surgical simulator, by contrast, could measure that force and indicate when a trainee is applying excessive or insufficient pressure.
Worse yet, it misleads us into counterproductive economic policies.
Because financial institutions held much of these securities, their market values declined as well, leaving balance sheets in need of restructuring, particularly given their highly leveraged capital structures.
If the government could identify how the economy needed to be restructured and provide incentives to move resources more quickly in that direction, a properly designed program could alleviate and shorten the recession.
First, the value of financial institutions’ investments should immediately be marked down to their market values.
Beyond that, the realignment process is best left largely to private agents.
In 2000, the world’s leaders committed to achieve major reductions in poverty, hunger, and disease by 2015.
By using high-yield seeds, better soil management, and proper row planting, the community has more than tripled its crop production, and villagers who previously were hungry grain buyers are now food-secure grain sellers.
NEW YORK – Elites are under siege in every corner of the world.
In Thailand, the rage stems from the perceived neglect of the rural poor by the ruling class, backed by big business, the army, and the king.
The heroine of the US Tea Party movement, Sarah Palin, is as much a creature of twittering and the vast new blogosphere as she is of television and radio – perhaps more so.
There is, however, another way to look at the worldwide surge of populism.
Reliance on a self-promoting tycoon like Thaksin is not the best way to boost democracy, but nor is reliance on military coups and kingly intervention.

Simply put, Keynes believed that we cannot all cut our way to growth at the same time.
Indeed, just a year or two ago, “expansionary fiscal contraction” was all the rage, and a massive research effort went into proving its existence.
An International Monetary Fund paper in 2012 brought Alesina’s hour of glory to an end.
Second, austerity policies have hit those at the bottom of the income distribution far more severely than those at the top, simply because those at the top rely much less on government services.
But supporting Ahmadinejad turned out to be a costly decision for Khamenei – and for the Islamic Republic.
In 2009, after Khamenei rejected Ahmadinejad’s decision to appoint Mashai as his first deputy, Ahmadinejad brazenly appointed him Chief of Staff, a move that infuriated Khamenei.
In many ways, Ahmadinejad’s story resembles that of Banisadr.
Indeed, the lack of a strong, unified government capable of shaping a consensus could make it impossible even for Khamenei to change course, leaving Iran no choice but to persist in its diplomatic standoff with the West.
So it is no surprise that press freedom is the freedom that authoritarian governments are keenest to curtail.
Max Mosley admitted participating in this (not illegal) happening, but sued the News of the World for breach of privacy; the newspaper argued that it was in the “public interest” that Mosley’s sexual activities be disclosed.
By contrast, in Britain it is left to judges to decide what the “right to privacy” means.
The media might become a bit drearier, but public life would be far healthier.
Even if Bush could be forgiven for taking America, and much of the rest of the world, to war on false pretenses, and for misrepresenting the cost of the venture, there is no excuse for how he chose to finance it.
It will take years to overcome the excessive indebtedness and real-estate overhang that resulted.
But mistakes in the early years of those wars complicated that already-difficult battle.
The legacy will be with us for a long time. It pays to think before acting.
Goldman whiz-kid Fabrice Tourre is charged with having created a complicated security that was designed to fail.
“Double-entry bookkeeping” is one of the great discoveries of European civilization, but five centuries later most people are still muddled about assets and liabilities.
Political correctness is another aspect of this: calling disabled people “differently abled,” for example.
For emerging market countries, where the surge in capital inflows has led to fears of inflation and asset price bubbles, a pragmatic approach using a combination of macroeconomic and prudential financial policies is available.”
The price of clarity, like the price of liberty, is eternal vigilance, and the two are connected.
Thanks to reports just released by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee – one on the long-term implications of requiring higher capital-to-asset ratios, and one on the transitory effects of introducing them – we know more now about the likely impact of such regulation.
The second report finds that a one-percentage-point increase in bank capital ratios, if introduced gradually over four years, would lower GDP by about 0.2%.
None of this means that banks should be granted a regulatory holiday and forget the need to recapitalize.
But that doesn’t mean that reform should not be as cost-effective as possible.
“Men cannot be employed when the object of desire [i.e., money] is something which cannot be produced and the demand for which cannot readily be choked off.”
Economists disagree about when, under what circumstances, and in what order governments should move beyond these first two items on the checklist.
Germany and the US began theirs in 1933.
But, while we can all think of examples of Americans who rose to the top on their own, what really matters are the statistics: to what extent do an individual’s life chances depend on the income and education of his or her parents?
Those at the top, in such cases, are enriched at the direct expense of those at the bottom.
Market forces, of course, play a role, too, but markets are shaped by politics; and, in America, with its quasi-corrupt system of campaign finance and its revolving doors between government and industry, politics is shaped by money.
This leads to underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and technology, impeding the engines of growth.
He was shot 13 times in the back of his head and dumped in a cemetery, joining a macabre roll call of Latin American reporters brutalized for daring to speak out during the 1970’s and 1980’s.
Even more widespread than indirect repression is the corrupting pressure of government money.
All but the most courageous remain silent; with the threat of ruin for their paper or station, the risks that reporters run are no longer primarily their own.
Felling seven million hectares of trees each year, South America clears more forests than any other continent.
While the economic benefits we get from biodiversity might seem intangible, they are real and quantifiable.
But, while this implies that the benefits of conservation outstrip the costs by an extraordinary margin, the calculations have been widely criticized.
For a landowner, the value of cleared land works out to $300 per hectare on average.
Capitalists for Inclusive Growth
There are three main areas to which business should turn its attention if capitalism is to function in a more inclusive way and meet society’s most pressing needs.
For example, Unilever has rejected the short-term pressures of capital markets by ending quarterly earnings reporting and broadening its focus to advance greater social interests, rather than just the interests of its shareholders.
COPENHAGEN – This decade has seen remarkable progress against humanity’s greatest challenges.
Bill Gates’s Giving Pledge challenge has graduated from concept to campaign, with at least $125 billion promised to good causes.
The Copenhagen Consensus project, which I direct, provides a link between academic research and concrete economic analysis that can be used by decision-makers in the real world.
Debate and discussion is encouraged by ensuring that three papers are written for each topic, so that a range of expert opinions is available.
Pressure on China today to push up the value of the yuan against the dollar is eerily similar to the pressure on Japan 30 years ago to make the yen appreciate.
Sustained appreciation of a creditor country’s currency against the world’s dominant money is a recipe for a slowdown in economic growth, followed by eventual deflation, as Japan found in the 1990’s – with no obvious decline in its large relative trade surplus.
But interest rates on dollar assets are given in world markets independently of what China does.
Failing this, China must postpone full liberalization of its financial markets.
Communism fell. Germany was united.
Yet China will undoubtedly become the world’s largest economic power in the foreseeable future. To achieve this leadership position, it needs less than a quarter of US per capita GDP, because its population is more than four times larger.
The brain drain is a problem not only for South America west of the Andes and many African countries, but also for Turkey, Italy, Britain, the Balkan countries, Germany, and Finland.
It can only be hoped that the political leaders who shape the course of the twenty-first century will be wise enough to avoid such an outcome.
Regional cooperation should include areas ranging from trade, transport, and transit, to water and energy, as well as efforts to control of drug trafficking.
While illicit drugs are moved through all Central Asian countries, Tajikistan bears the brunt of the scourge due to its location at the northern border of Afghanistan.
The Hydrogen Solution
Their study lends scientific supportto several such projects underway in Europe aimed at proving that hydrogen gas, converted from water via electrolysis – think of it as natural gas minus the polluting carbon – and stored, for example, in subterranean salt caverns, can smooth out fluctuations inherent in solar and wind energy.
According to the author and environmentalist Bill McKibben, Germany is in the international forefront of fighting climate change: “The clear alternative and the best news from 2012 came from Germany, the one big country that’s taken climate change seriously....There were days last summer when [Germans] generated more than half the power that they used from solar panels.”
Regardless of whether the referendum succeeds or fails, and regardless of the details of the constitutional text, what is most important is the establishment of constitutional processes and institutions in Iraq, before and after the referendum.
Those who chose not to participate in last January’s elections will most certainly do so now, both in the referendum and in the upcoming elections to a new Assembly in December.
However, given the little weight given to constitutions in Iraq’s modern history, it is likely that the political class will leave the text alone.
Constitutions frequently enshrine lofty principals, and nobly assure protection of fundamental rights.
The paradox is that, in the Soviet era, his art was used, briefly, as a force for liberation, because Nikita Khrushchev allowed the publication of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in order to buttress his anti-Stalin thaw.
It is a sad testament to Russia’s current mindset that it is Solzhenitsyn the anti-modernist crank who is being remembered, not Solzhenitsyn the towering foe of Soviet barbarism and mendacity.
Solzhenitsyn was banned, driven first underground and then into exile.
Yet perhaps one day we Russians will escape our false dreams, and when that day comes, the heroic Solzhenitsyn, the Solzhenitsyn who could never surrender or be corrupted, will be restored to us.
On the other were conservatives, “a class of men who cling with fondness to whatever is ancient, and who, even when convinced by overpowering reasons that innovation would be beneficial, consent to it with many misgivings and forebodings.”
Beck, who denies that he is anti-Semitic, is a conspiracy theorist of classic vintage, though the content of his alleged conspiracies is, to put it bluntly, weird.

One would think that a self-proclaimed conservative like Beck would support that sort of activity.
Along with a relatively minor spreadsheet error, they identified some methodological choices in the original Reinhart/Rogoff work that threw the robustness of their results into question.
No matter how far apart their political views may have been, the two sides shared a common language about what constitutes evidence and – for the most part – a common approach to resolving differences.
Consider what happens in international trade, where such shading of research is established practice.
Second, empirical evidence is rarely reliable enough to settle decisively a controversy characterized by deeply divided opinion.
If these skills also render them perceptive observers of real societies and provide them with sound judgment, it is hardly by design.
The ruling United Russia party’s recent poor performance in regional elections show that the electorate is fed up with the status quo and is ready to vote for an alternative.
But a government official must pursue the public interest, which includes preserving a competitive environment in the oil or banking sector.
First, it is not clear who will replace the bureaucrats as board chairs.
Whether these improvements in corporate governance are actually implemented will be clear to all.
But when in several years one of his former regional First Secretaries, Boris Yeltsin that is, signed a decree banning the Communist Party none of 18 million party members went to the streets to protest.
Putin’s supposedly heroic victory came in the war with Georgia of 2008, followed by the subsequent virtual annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
So now we hear pathetic echoes of all the reform communist efforts of the long years of Soviet decline: Putinism without Putin, Putinism with a human face, etc.
The PRI promised to reestablish order and predictability, and to reduce the violence inflicted by the drug cartels, even if that means reaching a modus vivendi with them.
But any reasonable analysis of the current PRI does not support that prediction, and reveals it to be based on little more than wishful thinking.
The Quality of Mercy
Megrahi was convicted of murdering 270 people, and sentenced to life imprisonment.
For a pickpocket who has served half of a two-year sentence, it would be excessively harsh to insist on the sentence being served in full if that meant that he would die in prison, rather than with his family.
And, if we believe that Megrahi was not sufficiently punished for his crime, what are we to make of the treatment of former Lieutenant William Calley?
One wonders if the relatives of those murdered at My Lai are more ready to forgive Calley than the relatives of those killed at Lockerbie are to forgive Megrahi.
As with the Quantified Self, the tools for collecting and analyzing data about everything from public health to potholes in roads, real-estate prices, school attendance, and more are beginning to emerge.
The goal is to create competition – among communities and among developers of the tools – and thus to foster even better tools and more livable, productive communities.
In addition to selling advertising around the data, local newspapers could charge institutions for specific data analyses, benchmarking studies, and the like.
The Hong Kong meeting of the Doha Round of trade negotiations has left a palpable sense of frustration in the developing world over the slow pace of agricultural liberalization agreed to by the rich countries.
Indeed, without returning to the illusion of economic planning, these countries need to be able to set conditions for foreign investors that aim to maximize the local impact on employment, technological diffusion, strategic partnerships, and so forth.
Such a prospect would be even less acceptable to developing countries.
Some economists point to imperfect information, which precludes companies from considering the higher returns on investment available in the developing world.
On September 19, the French researcher Gilles-Eric Séralini attempted to fuel public opposition to genetically modified foods by showing the public how GM corn, with and without the pesticide Roundup, caused huge tumors and early death in 200 rats that had consumed it over two years.
Of these, five died within two years, which is unusual, because studies of thousands of untreated Sprague-Dawley rats show that about half should have died in that period.
That, in turn, implies less human encroachment into natural ecosystems, enabling greater biodiversity.
The technologies that can really make a difference quickly and at lower cost are scrubbers that clean smokestack emissions, catalytic converters that reduce tailpipe emissions, and many others.
One is Europe's aging population.
Even more fundamentally, racial considerations also influence the nature of America's political institutions.
It is lacking in the racially mixed Southeast and Southwest.
The second is to somehow restrict welfare benefits to "natives."
And yet, over the last few years Burma has also emerged as a significant producer of energy in Southeast Asia.
The device is simple.
Recorded at the market exchange rate, however, these earnings translate into 1.2 trillion kyat – an amount large enough to eliminate Burma’s budget deficit, as well as the destructively inflationary money printing that is the regime’s preferred method of public finance.
The report noted that nobody had been prosecuted.
In February 2006, we visited a refugee camp on the Thai-Burma border and learned first hand of war and abuse.
But the junta engages in Orwellian doublethink.
Such abuse of power is inadmissible, and we expect ASEAN to address the military’s use of rape in the conflict in Burma.
In other words, a central bank’s primary responsibility is not to preserve the health of the firms that make up the banking sector, but rather to maintain the robust functioning of the economy as a whole.
But, while such an announcement is an obvious no-brainer for those in the Macroeconomic Camp, it would make all bankers who hold nominal assets or who think in nominal terms physically ill.
The world, fixated on China’s rise, was slow to pay attention to this seismic shift in the politics of the globe’s second largest economy.
Look what happens when Asians are foolish enough to import such a system, as in South Korea or Taiwan.
This involved some strong-arm tactics, especially against the unions, but it worked mostly because the middle class settled for an informal deal: increased material prosperity in exchange for political acquiescence.
The DPJ’s aims are excellent: more authority to elected politicians, less bureaucratic meddling, more independence from the US, better relations with Asian neighbors, more power to voters and less to big business, and so on.
The Re-Education of Hong Kong
What triggered the uproar was the appearance of a “model” textbook, financed by the government and published by a pro-China think tank.
The students have promised to continue to fight the program until it is scrapped.
And most, if not all, of the children of the ruling elite in Beijing are in a similar position.
He claimed that he had only Hong Kong’s interest in mind within the limits of China’s “one country, two systems” formula.
In medieval Spain, Quixote-like knights probably did roam the countryside, ridding it not of dragons but of the land’s few remaining Muslims.
Che was no humanist.
As could be expected, Che applied Soviet policies to the Cubans: agriculture was destroyed and ghost factories dotted the landscape.
Beyond Cuba, the Che myth has inspired thousands of students and activists across Latin America to lose their lives in foolhardy guerrilla struggles.
The Real Danger of Global Warming
With the global financial crisis and the sudden economic downturn, two things are becoming clear.
So I am amazed to see people going along with the currently fashionable political argument that policies like cap-and-trade, government mandates, and subsidies for renewable energy can actually benefit an economy.
The Real Long March
It remains a daunting journey, through areas little changed to this day, inaccessible, and desperately poor.
Mao told Edgar Snow, author of Red Star Over China, that crossing the Dadu River was the single most important incident during the Long March, and today it is eulogized as such.
There were constant debates about the final destination.
Not, however, for the 21,000 men and women of the Western Legion.
The Long Marchers persevered, fought, starved, despaired, and endured.
CANBERRA – The brouhaha over Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff’s article “Growth in a Time of Debt” may be the most conspicuous and incendiary scholarly controversy since 1974, when two earlier economists, Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, published a notorious book, Time on the Cross, defending the efficiency of American plantation slavery.
Yet the Bureau does not require scholars to post their data and programs to its Web site as a condition for working-paper publication.
In the case of Reinhart and Rogoff, the observation that highly indebted countries grow more slowly, even if true, does not tell us anything about whether high debt causes slow growth or vice versa.
The real problem is scholarly procedures and priorities, not motives.
In his Instauratio Magna, Francis Bacon, one of modern science’s most articulate proponents, conveyed a vision of a new world, transformed through the systematic inquiry of natural phenomena.
As the American Museum of Natural History provocatively asked at the 2001 opening of its genetics exhibition: “The genomic revolution is here – are you ready?”
But realizing this vision requires accounting for the different choices that people make within a pluralistic society.
The transition of power from one dominant state to another is a familiar historical pattern, but power diffusion is a more novel process.
In an information age, however, it may be the state (or non-state) with the best story that wins.
As the cost of computing and communication comes down, the barriers to entry decline.
In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak’s rule helped to moderate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and balanced Iranian power in the region.
Putin then decided to disavow his own marriage to Lyudmila Shkrebneva, his wife of 29 years, announcing the divorce in as publicly humiliating a way as possible – his wife was standing by his side – for a reserved Russian woman.
He said it was over, with his stone-faced wife on hand to confirm with a silence that spoke louder than words.
If former French President Nicolas Sarkozy could divorce and remarry a world-famous model and singer while in office, a Russian president can, too.
By contrast, the suicide in 1939 of Stalin’s wife, Nadezhda Allilueva, underscored the reign of terror in the country.
In many countries, fears have even arisen of a prolonged period of slow and occasionally negative growth, persistent obstacles to reducing unemployment, and continued economic anxiety; or worse, of a Japanese-style “lost decade” with multiple recessions; or, even worse, of a depression, (which politicians and intellectuals have stoked in an attempt to justify continued massive government intervention in the economy for years to come).
Thereafter, growth is labeled an “expansion.”
But the economy did indeed grow in the interim – just barely enough to consider them distinct recessions.
If the economy declines again – a highly plausible prospect – we would have a triple dip, although perhaps not an outright second recession.
Contrary to the election in 2000, when President Bush lost the popular vote and barely won the vote in the Electoral College, Bush prevailed this time by 3.5 million votes.
For much of its early history – to say nothing of the era of the Civil War and Reconstruction – the country was as closely divided as it is today, and bitter campaign rhetoric reflected the closeness of the competition.
Social conservatives interpreted this to mean that they won the election for Bush, and that their agenda should dominate his next term.
But political elites, such as party activists and members of Congress, tend to be more extreme than the public.
When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 after an abortive attempt by the Greek military junta in Athens to carry out Enosis (unification with Greece), 250,000 or so Greek Cypriots were uprooted from their homes.
Within a few years, the refugees were absorbed into the economy and society of the southern, Greek Cypriot sector of the island.
The Greek Cypriots chose the path of non-violence; the Palestinians chose the opposite route.
The new report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), involving more than 120 scientists, economists, and technology specialists, provides that long-overdue assessment.
Renewables cut air pollution, which is costing the global economy billions of dollars a year in health-care costs alone.
International policies, including the lending decisions of the World Bank and regional development banks, must evolve, as do the strategies of the UN and bilateral donors.
The IPCC report has provided a solid, scientific foundation for a low-carbon, resource-efficient future.
RMB appreciation should have started earlier and at a faster pace, when China’s trade surplus was much smaller and its growth was much less dependent on exports.
The dilemma that officials face is that the impact of a fall in exports as a result of RMB appreciation will be felt acutely and immediately, whereas the large welfare losses due to the evaporation of the value of China’s foreign-exchange reserves will be borne by society as a whole – but not immediately.
But if the RMB is allowed to float, isn’t a balanced trade account likely? Probably not.
But that dual objective requires structural change in the Chinese and US economies.
To some people, the question is a moral one.
The lord has made no improvements to the river and is helping nobody in any way, directly or indirectly, except himself.
Why shouldn’t banks be allowed to engage in any business they want, at least as long as we have regulators to ensure that the banks’ activities do not jeopardize the entire financial infrastructure?
The new consensus can be described as follows: Ségolène Royal cannot defeat Nicolas Sarkozy, but Sarkozy can defeat himself.
Her defeat would be theirs, too, but their resentment over losing the nomination to her is so far proving stronger than their political survival instincts.
It is as if France were now seized by a kind of nostalgic generosity toward a presidency that had been marked by suspicion and derision.
The Resistible Rise of Asia?
To take the most significant example, China staged military interventions even when it was poor and internally troubled.
And, by picking territorial fights with its neighbors and pursuing a muscular foreign policy, China’s leaders are compelling other Asian states to work more closely with the US and each other.
So make no mistake. Asia’s challenges are graver than those facing Europe, which embodies comprehensive development more than any other part of the world.
Both are rich in diamonds.
(As the old adage has it, banks only like to lend to those who do not need money.)
Democratic, consensual, and transparent processes - such as those in Botswana - are more likely to ensure that the fruits of a country's wealth are equitably and well spent.
Western governments can help with common-sense reforms.
No state can abdicate the responsibility to protect its own people from crimes against humanity, let alone justify perpetrating such crimes itself.
Is it time to apply and enforce a no-fly zone? Or to go further still and send in ground forces with a mandate to do what it takes?
The hope was that states’ failure to protect their inhabitants would no longer be seen as nobody else’s business, as had been the case for centuries, but as the entire world’s concern.
If these measures do not bite immediately, and the carnage continues, there will be no alternative but to do more.
Brazil has attempted to address the issue by crafting a resolution that would decouple the R2P mandate from the use of force – effectively eliminating the possibility that the doctrine could be applied.
Even cooperation on climate change is crumbling, with the US and China rejecting the multilateral, top-down approach to policymaking.
Governments before World War I – and even more so before WWII – did not embrace the mission of minimizing unemployment during economic downturns.
All three of these factors vanished between the world wars.
How can the US have a large political movement – the Tea Party – pushing for the hardest of hard-money policies when there is no hard-money lobby with its wealth on the line? How is it that the unemployed, and those who fear they might be the next wave of unemployed, do not register to vote?
The Fed cannot reduce short-term interest rates below zero, so it is attempting via this policy of “quantitative easing” to reduce longer-term interest rates.
“But we Japanese,” he writes, “don’t have a religion such as Christianity or Islam, so we need something else: deep emotion.”
Some thinkers, most notably Max Weber, floated the idea that capitalism must be sustained by a value system that could not initially be created from within.
But a deeper view of freedom regards it as having intrinsic value.
Oddly, it was Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu who, by requesting that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, reopened the 1948 file.
As a result, the Palestinian community in the occupied territories was always subservient to the primacy of the Palestinian Diaspora.
The Palestinians are attempting to hold the stick at both ends, claiming before the world their endorsement of the two-state solution while calling for the right of return at the same time.
The Return of American Realism
Much of this debate can be viewed through the lens of American involvement with Iraq.
This shift is also evident in US policy toward China.
Israel, for example, has had peaceful relations with non-democratic Egypt and Jordan for more than three decades.
Britain has largely excluded itself from any leadership role in Europe.
Of course, it is impossible to underestimate the combination of suspicion, tension, and exasperation that characterizes Franco-German relations lately.
France and Germany have different sensitivities on the subject, which is both natural and inevitable, as these differences reflect both geography and history.
An economy’s current account is the difference between its investment rate and its savings rate.
China has the opposite problem.
The resulting flood of liquidity caused a global boom that benefited economies from Elizabethan England to Mughal India.
So, the real question is what the next generation of symbiotic imbalances will look like.
Industrial policy is back.
And the highly successful salmon industry is the creation of Fundación Chile, a quasi-public venture fund.
The shift toward embracing industrial policy is therefore a welcome acknowledgement of what sensible analysts of economic growth have always known: developing new industries often requires a nudge from government.
Given its risks and the gap between its social and private benefits, innovation requires rents – returns above what competitive markets provide.
What determines success in industrial policy is not the ability to pick winners, but the capacity to let the losers go – a much less demanding requirement.
Moreover, in the absence of an impartial judge, a winner can always impose his “truth” upon the vanquished, as happened with the Treaty of Versailles after World War I.
In the meantime, the return to the idea of a “just cause” carries big risks, especially evident when, as happened in Georgia, a great power claims the mantle of a protector of the rights of its nationals in a neighboring country.
The medieval Popes practiced this wisdom when they limited permissible wars to certain times of year.
Fighting terrorism is not a war, because terrorism itself is not a warring party, but a means to an end.
And, in their heyday, mercantilists certainly did defend some very odd notions, chief among which was the view that national policy ought to be guided by the accumulation of precious metals – gold and silver.
But when it works, as it has so often in Asia, the model’s “government-business collaboration” or “pro-business state” quickly garners heavy praise.
Mercantilists, however, view trade as a means of supporting domestic production and employment, and prefer to spur exports rather than imports.
Liberals should be happy to have their consumption subsidized by mercantilists.
The Return of Mexico’s Nemesis
The country’s civil society has become more organized, more powerful, and more vibrant.
In this era, the government can’t get away with stealing elections, throwing political opponents in jail, expropriating foreign or domestic private assets, large-scale corruption, or profligate spending.
But I believe that we did accomplish the task, and that to fear an authoritarian restoration would be to deny everything that we have all achieved over the past 12 years.
Bulgaria’s entry into the European Union was heralded by a presidential race between an ex-communist (the victor, who claimed to like the EU) and a proto-fascist (who says he hates Turks, Gypsies, and Jews).
They do not believe that constitutional norms and representative democracy have primacy over values and “legitimate” popular grievances.
Moreover, these populists attack the EU as an elite-imposed project, while pro-European coalitions have become exhausted, disintegrating in the aftermath of EU accession in 2004.
And, while nationalist populism is a trans-European phenomenon, populism today, unlike in the 1930’s, it does not hold itself out as an alternative to democracy.
This new appeal to religion – after a long period when it was taken for granted that secularization would make religion less and less politically relevant – is not an exclusively French phenomenon.
Globally, there might be good reasons to talk about what sociologists describe as the rise of “post-secular societies,” but Europe remains the exception.
That is not an absurd idea.
Successful coups legitimated by popular support (or at least acquiescence) and oiled with promises to “restore democracy” may become infectious, encouraging copycats in neighboring states where governments are also weak or failing.
In Guinea, despite 24 previous years of authoritarian military rule, the population largely supported the December 2008 bloodless coup staged by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara’s immediately following President Lansana Conté’s death.
But these steps are largely ineffective – or worse.
Nevertheless, coups, whether violent or peaceful, are the antithesis of democratic institutions, and military rule can last a long time.
Nepal’s 15-year experiment with democracy now seems over.
Newspapers and magazines are blandly reproducing official pronouncements and reports from the state-run news agency.
Old jokes from the pre-1990 days have returned, like this one: a man was walking down a Kathmandu street, shouting, “Down with dictatorship in Pakistan.” A policeman grabbed him and took him in.
Perhaps King Gyanendra does have something up his sleeves.
The Mexican Revolution of 1910 began with a challenge to the dictator Porfirio Díaz that ignited peasant uprisings and worker revolts.
But that disastrous campaign weakened Mao’s influence; by the early 1960’s he seemed to be relegated to the sidelines while pragmatists like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping grew stronger.
How should the US and European leaders respond?
Instead, they would seek to enter the world trade body as a single customs union.
Finally, the EU insists that Russia abolish planned prohibitive export tariffs on lumber. Only the Georgian issue is really serious.
Before Putin resigned as president in May 2008, he presented his “Russia 2020” program.
The prominent Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer insists that their prime aim is to finish off Georgia and its president, Mikheil Saakashvili, who remains in power and defiant.
Putin or his collaborators seem to be setting up Medvedev for a failure, suggesting that their jealousy of Medvedev’s limited power is greater than their interest in defending Russia’s national interests.
Then, there are the reactions to the new government, which have been marked by a temperateness of tone that is highly unusual – and all the more surprising, given that David Cameron, the new prime minister, has not exactly been the bearer of good news.
In a sense, the Conservative-Liberal coalition represents a culmination of this trend.
Clearly, however, nationalization, or a state-managed economy, is not in the cards.
There is a challenge to meet, a reason to pull together.
However, over time, other factors behind the growing number of cases, such as immigration and a particular type of drug-resistant TB, have emerged.

For example, one of the studies that we reviewed found that no standard therapy in the initial or secondary phase of treatment was associated with an unsuccessful outcome or death.
The DOTS strategy is not implemented in all European countries, owing in part to disagreement about whether treatment is a duty or a right.
For example, on Sina’s microblog site, bloggers used pictures, euphemisms, and English or traditional Chinese characters to avoid censorship.
Ever since Iranians used Twitter to swap information and inform the outside world about the mushrooming protests against the stolen presidential election of June 2009, there has been much discussion about the role of digital activism in authoritarian countries like China.
Passionate people did not understand why the public seemed unconcerned about their efforts.
In fact, a series of protests and events held since the second half of 2009 suggests a close relationship between Twitter and contentious real-life politics, and thus invites new possibilities for reshaping China’s authoritarian regime.
When merit is measured by money, there is no ethical limit to the size of an individual’s paycheck.
So yesterday’s (pre-crisis) world is being resurrected.
I also participate indirectly and abstractly in forging the common good, by creating value through my work, and I am rewarded for it.
But don’t hold your breath waiting for them to agree.
The Guardian Council's barring of over 2,000 mostly reformist candidates from participating in the parliamentary elections was the last straw.
Many are reactionary religious fundamentalists who abhor the concept of democracy.
Although he is capable of providing people with increased political and social freedoms, he is simply unwilling.
As a result, Iran's near-term political prospects appear ominous.
Courageous Iranians who have labored to reform their country may continue to feel as though they are plowing the seas.
Indeed, the hybrid presidential/parliamentary system that Ukraine established as part of the settlement which brought a peaceful end to our revolution is being hollowed out in order to concentrate all political power in the hands of a supposedly democratically elected president.
Yet he was not.
One way to help prevent a democratic revolution from being betrayed from within is by building a genuine civil society.
As people around the world encourage the prospect of democracy coming to Egypt and Tunisia, let us not be beguiled by its formal trappings.
The conservative ARENA party, which has governed El Salvador since the country’s 10-year civil war ended in 1992, did everything possible to prevent an FMLN victory, resorted, once again, to every red-baiting trick in the book.
As recently as a year ago, anyone who visited FMLN headquarters in San Salvador to interview, for example, Ceren, its Secretary General, would be struck by the overwhelming presence of Chávez: red shirts, red berets, pictures of the Venezuelan caudillo, quotations from his teachings and musings.
We will know soon.
A general strike, affecting everything except electricity and the press, brings the country to a halt.
And it works.
Success is measured by one’s salary.
Nineteen sixty-eight is going global, fueled by doubt among university youth about the world that is being built.
A huge march shows the trade unions’ support for the student movement.
Some ministers resign, but there is no attack against institutions.
Everywhere outside Paris, calls for decentralization and regionalism grow.
The Cultural Revolution marked the climax of class extermination practiced by the Party during the 1960’s.
According to Wang Youqin, author of Victims of the Cultural Revolution , after Mao received the Red Guards and instructed them in the “militant fight,” more than 1,700 people were beaten, drowned, or scalded to death. Another 100,000 were driven from their homes.
The author Zheng Yi reported that in Wuxuan County alone, more than 100 people were eaten, because devouring enemies was the only way to prove one’s love for Mao.
Worst of all, Mao’s crimes against civilization, unlike those of, say, Hitler, are ongoing.
In June, the prestigious journal Science published an article by the South Korean scientist Woo-Suk Hwang and an international team of co-authors describing how they had developed what were, in effect, “made to order” lines of human stem cells cloned from an adult.
If Hwang was not the first to do it, someone else eventually will.
If, at a later date, the woman wants to have a child, why should she use the DNA of her earlier, aborted fetus rather than conceiving another fetus in the usual way? Each fetus – the one she aborts and the one she later conceives through sexual intercourse – has its own “unique” DNA.
From Bill Clinton to Robert Redford, countless pundits blamed Sandy on climate change.
(Sandy, which was downgraded from a hurricane before it hit New York, was rebranded in the media as a “superstorm.”)
Models show that the world’s most ambitious climate policy, the EU’s “20-20-20” plan, will have a net cost of roughly $250 billion a year for the rest of the century, or about $20 trillion in total. Yet it will reduce sea-level rise by just nine millimeters by 2100.
Anchoring the Arab Awakening
But what the Arab region needs are micro-oriented, project-based, and governance-heavy investments conditioned on deep reform of a business environment that is generally considered among the worst in the world.
Achieving ambitious goals for inclusive growth and job creation quickly without an enabling state and without using the banking system will be extremely difficult.
On the other hand, they are unlikely to benefit from the subsequent robust growth that most European transition countries experienced.
Welby’s request to die was widely publicized in Italy, where it led to heated debate.
Even the Roman Catholic Church has long held that there is no obligation to use “extraordinary” or “disproportionate” means to prolong life – a view reiterated in the “Declaration on Euthanasia” issued by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by Pope John Paul II in 1980.
This distinction is dubious.
The Dutch know how voluntary euthanasia is practiced in their country, they know that legal euthanasia has improved, rather than harmed, their medical care, and they want the possibility of assistance in dying, if they should want and need it.
This October, 128 leading experts in the fields of human rights and equality from 44 countries launched a landmark attempt to build on the epochal 1948 UN declaration to establish universal human equality.
These participants argued that specific legal duties, such as the right to a minimum wage and the right to vocational training, are more effective than the vague extension of anti-discrimination law to cover poverty as such.
Today, it is crucial if we are to prevent an even greater chasm from dividing the world’s haves and have-nots.
In these circumstances, continuing to raise borrowing costs would be a mistake.
Nevertheless, China must be careful when implementing RMB appreciation.
In the absence of a generalized appreciation of all Asian currencies and unchanged American policies, possibly only a deep recession could reduce the overall US current-account deficit.
The group’s initiative, led by Räsänen, is called eCars - Now!
But the company’s Web site continues to attract new prospects, with 1,000 people now registered as likely or certain to buy such a vehicle.
Overall, the economics make sense.
Any far-sighted government could help not by subsidizing these efforts, but by buying up the old gasoline engines.
The Rights of Apes – and Humans
The Great Ape Project seeks to change the way we think about great apes, and ultimately, about animals in general.
Another, Martin Balluch, has been given a 1,500-page police file to justify his arrest.
It means rule by those who have merit.
Certainly, French leaders are not immune to corruption.
What about those who do not make it to university? How do the other 50% fare in a meritocratic world?
To this must be added another feature that Young described: meritocracy means only that another ruling group closes the gates behind it once it has achieved its status.
The Rise and Fall of Putinism
Now, from the entire spectrum of civil and political rights enumerated in Russia’s Constitution, we Russians have only one right remaining: the right to leave and return to the country freely.
A struggle for the restitution of constitutional rights in Russia first became noticeable in 2009.
Russia’s federal government and regional authorities are clearly alarmed by this rapidly growing civic activism.
Indeed, China is increasingly emphasizing its naval and maritime interests: economic development, territorial management, energy and food security as well as trade.
On the Spratley and Paracel islands -- seized from Vietnam and the Philippines respectively -- China is building port facilities to moor large surface ships and runways large enough to handle long-range bombers.

This will provide China with necessary capabilities to invade, should China’s rulers wish, Japan’s most remote islands, including the disputed Senkaku Islands, as well as Taiwan.
But TB treatment has been shadowed by the specter of drug resistance since the dawn of the antibiotic era.  Fifteen years ago, an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in New York City induced near panic, before a massive infusion of funds into the public health infrastructure turned the tide in the United States, and public interest waned.
Effective treatment and cure of MDR-TB requires prolonged use (typically two years) of a combination of drugs, including second-line drugs that for the most part are less potent than first-line agents, more toxic, or both.
The Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance has collected information on prevalence, patterns, and trends of drug resistance since 1994, focusing on resistance to first-line drugs and contributing much to our understanding of MDR-TB.  But surveillance for XDR-TB has been more limited, as drug susceptibility testing for second-line drugs is not well-standardized and for some drugs is poorly reproducible, while few countries perform such testing within the context of their national TB programs.  
China’s economy is growing more rapidly, and its total size will probably overtake Japan’s in a decade or two, but any serious analysis of power in East Asia must include Japan as a major factor.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has taken a more nationalistic stance than most of his predecessors, and his Liberal Democratic Party is committed to revising Article 9 of the constitution, which limits Japan’s forces to self-defense.
This would be a way for Japan to escape its reputation for insularity, avoid the mistakes of its military history, improve its relations with Asian neighbors who still remember the 1930’s, and increase Japan’s “soft” or attractive power.
The Rise of Mid-Level Powers
For many years, Japan has been taking very cautious steps into this area, but substantial changes have occurred recently.
Once such a coalition gains a sure footing, the next step would be to participate actively in the negotiation of major security issues, such as international arms control, arms reduction, and non-proliferation, while encouraging the involvement of China and Russia.
By 2020, China’s e-tail market could be as large as today’s markets in the US, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France combined.
Mass consumption in China and other emerging economies is coming of age in the Internet era.
Such businesses are also leveraging their broad access and widely recognized brands to expand their role in the financial-services sector.
But its approach to e-tail is poised to be one of the forces shaping the emerging-market Internet revolution of the twenty-first century.
Since the late twentieth century, most employment growth has come in services, particularly personal services – a pattern that looks like a reversal of a previous historical trend.
Lawyers work out prenuptial contracts, and then the complexities of divorce negotiations.
None of these new services can easily be standardized, or dealt with at long distances (as can some types of clerical legal and financial work).
In that pre-modern world, private life was extraordinarily public, whereas the social movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries dramatically expanded the realm of individual privacy and self-definition.
MOSCOW – I was recently posed the following question: “The most important way in which the Internet and online social media are changing our world is [fill in the blank].” My standard answer is that it changes the balance of power between individuals and institutions.
Those companies go online to earn money.
This phenomenon is not visible yet, because analysts focus on popular bloggers and online media sites competing with traditional media.
The attention economy is one in which people spend their personal time attracting others’ attention, whether by designing creative avatars, posting pithy comments, or accumulating “likes” for their cat photos.
China is clearly pleased to see that the United States is now also placing cool calculation of its national interests at the forefront of its foreign policy.
America’s new pragmatism is also the consequence of a process of “reverse socialization.”
America has the flexibility, capacity, and leadership to adapt to the new rules for pursuing diplomacy, but Europe simply does not.
And, if China comes out of the crisis as the big winner and continues to boost its power, zero-sum thinking will soon replace win-win cooperation.
But, at the same time, small states are also more likely to be successful in defending crucial aspects of the welfare state.
They have their own problems, but at the same time they are likely to behave more like traditional big states, and will try to shape globalization rather than simply accepting it as an inevitable process.
Many commentators, indeed, were stunned by the rapidity with which tensions returned to the international system.
All four North African rulers have, to greater or lesser degrees, made themselves the center of highly opaque power structures.
In Egypt, where such preparations are the most obvious, Gamal and other senior figures have stubbornly denied his presidential ambitions.
His departure would expose the anachronistic nature of the state’s ideological foundation; family ties will do nothing to protect his successor from the resulting shock to the system.
Ben Ali’s successor could raise his profile by clamping down on cronyism.
The new Penn World Table, Version 6.2, comparing standards of living across countries, has just been released.
Despite all the talk about the Chinese economic miracle, China’s ranking has risen only slightly, from 61st out of 82 countries in 2000 to 60th in 2004 – even though per capita real GDP grew by 44% between 2000 and 2004, or 9.6% a year, the highest of the major countries.
Economic performance in several Latin American countries was relatively weak in this period, with Uruguay’s real GDP per capita actually recording a fall by a fraction of a percent.
What have people been spending all that extra money on? Is it all dictated by advertisers and salesmen who are inventing needs?
The Risk of European Centralization
Politicians launched monetary union in 1999, despite warnings that the constituent economies were too diverse.
Indeed, it is Europe’s economic achievements that give it a political voice in the world.
This approach – harmonization, coordination, and centralized decision-making – continues to be regarded as a panacea for Europe’s problems.
Its current economic malaise reflects European leaders’ prolonged efforts to deny the obvious.
Ethnic violence marred the 1997 election as well.
But an updated constitution cannot instantly transform a country’s politics and society.
Many participants make simplistic, ethnocentric statements like, “Kikuyus should never rule Kenya again” (Kenyatta is a member of the dominant Kikuyu tribe).
Meanwhile, nothing has been done to appease the millions of poor Kenyans who are likely to heed a politician’s exhortation to kill.
Chinese shadow banking totals only about $2.2 trillion.
They should begin by reforming the property-rights regime to enable market forces to balance the supply and demand of savings and investments in a manner that maintains credit discipline and transparency.
Low-risk central-government bonds and central-bank reserve requirements – most of which are backed by substantial foreign-exchange reserves – account for ¥31 trillion of the ¥95 trillion in total commercial-bank assets.
Ultimately, addressing shadow banking in China will require mechanisms that clearly define, allocate, and adjudicate financial risks among the key players.
With lower and more realistic growth forecasts, fiscal deficits in the short to medium term are viewed as more dangerous.
Success is by no means assured, and the most likely outcome is a sequence of contagion events and a broader loss of confidence in the euro.
But that was not inevitable.
The alternative will be unilateral measures aimed at achieving the same goals, but leading to outcomes that leave everyone worse off.
SWFs pose concrete risks, some of which have already materialized, to the global economy and to financial markets both at home and in host countries.
But, while they are an important first step toward managing SWFs’ legal framework, institutional and governance structure, and investment and risk-management policies, they are unevenly applied, and are widely considered inadequate.
While the regulations are likely to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial crises, they will also make long-term loans more expensive and investments in illiquid assets riskier.
This initiative should be supported unequivocally, serving as a springboard for a stronger focus on green investment among SWFs.
Indeed, those who can borrow (high-grade firms and prime households) don’t want or need to, while those who need to – highly leveraged firms and non-prime households – can’t, owing to the credit crunch.
Yet imposing capital controls on inflows is difficult and sometimes leaky.
Also, if exit occurs by selling the long-term assets purchased during QE, a sharp increase in interest rates might choke off recovery, resulting in large financial losses for holders of long-term bonds.
And policymakers have moved to a risky credit-easing policy as QE’s effectiveness has waned.
But the road ahead is bumpy and uncertain.
Trade within Asia now accounts for more than half of the continent’s total trade turnover.

With economic shocks able to spread more quickly than ever before, owing to broadened trade and financial channels, all Asian countries must maintain a sound macroeconomic environment.
The authorities also introduced the “qualified domestic institutional investors” (QDII) program to enable residents to invest in foreign assets – one of many initiatives aimed at easing upward pressure on the renminbi’s exchange rate by encouraging capital outflows.
As Barry Eichengreen has pointed out in the context of the post-WWII Bretton Woods system, capital controls weaken “the link between domestic and foreign economic policies, providing governments room to pursue other objectives.”
A third reason to go slow on easing capital controls is that China’s economic reforms remain incomplete, with property rights not yet clearly defined.
In these circumstances, with China’s financial system too fragile to withstand external shocks, and the global economy mired in turmoil, the PBOC would be unwise to gamble on the ability of rapid capital-account liberalization to generate a healthier and more robust financial system.
So the real question is how the public feels about crossing the line between medical treatments for existingpeople and irreversible genetic alterations that would be passed on to future generations through genetic modification of the human germline (the sequence of germ cells,such as sperm and eggs, containing genetic material that a child may inherit).
Nevertheless, in 2011, a coalition of scientists and funders submitted a letter to former UK Secretary of State for Health Andrew Lansley requesting regulation revision, in order to permit the new techniques’ use in clinical treatment “once sufficient pre-clinical evidence [was] established.”
The HFEA’s own expert panel reported that the safety of mitochondrial techniques is far from being proven for current users.
The UK scientific and charitable organizations advocating mitochondrial research are proud of the permissive legislative framework that has enabled them to establish an “international lead.”
The political heat is also being turned up in the Arctic Council, a body set up to facilitate cooperation between states with Arctic territories.
Of the large oil companies, only one – France’s Total – has argued against Arctic oil exploration and exploitation on the grounds of environmental risks and economic costs.
Where are such people to be found in the Arctic?
There is, however, one way to shorten the time required to cap a well to a matter of days: drill two holes in parallel from the start.
Despite using all the means at its disposal, the world’s greatest military power managed only to create a precarious domestic stability.
Separatism was never a threat here, but ever since the Soviet invasion in 1979, the country has been a theater of war for global and regional conflicts.
The lessons of the 1990’s aren’t difficult to understand and are too important to ignore.
The West wants to withdraw from Afghanistan and will surely do so.
The severe recession, combined with the financial crisis during 2008-2009, worsened developed countries’ fiscal positions, owing to stimulus spending, lower tax revenues, and backstopping and ring-fencing of their financial sectors.
While that could be contractionary, the gain in fiscal-policy credibility might prevent a damaging spike in long-term government-bond yields.
Japan is a net creditor and largely finances its debt domestically.
A disorderly rush to the exit could lead to a dollar collapse, a spike in long-term interest rates, and a severe double dip recession.
They back Hezbollah – and help Iran send it weapons – because Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah’s shock troops keep the government in Beirut weak.
Today, parts of the ruling Ba’ath elite worry about Syria’s deepening alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah.
Besides, widespread revulsion against Syria for its alleged role in the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, particularly among Lebanon’s Maronites, Sunnis, and Druze, means that Lebanon is unlikely to ever become totally subservient again – that is, unless Hezbollah gets to call the shots.
So America and Europe must help him reach this conclusion.
A similar challenge now faces North Africa and the Middle East, where most Arab countries are experiencing massive upheavals.
Even in tiny Bahrain, the Sunni minority has, for now, succeeded in maintaining its rule over the Shia majority, albeit with military help from neighboring Sunni-led countries.
Yet, even in Egypt, the challenges are enormous.
But a context in which a fundamentalist Islamic group like the Muslim Brotherhood is the strongest organization in society, with very little effective countervailing powers, creates a serious challenge.
BERKELEY – For 15 months, the United States Federal Reserve, assisted by the financial regulators of the US Treasury, have been trying to make the macroeconomic consequences of the American mortgage-backed securities financial crisis as small as possible – trying, above all, to avoid a deep depression.
The logic behind that decision was that, previously in the crisis, equity shareholders had been severely punished when their firms were judged too big to fail.
The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy created an extraordinary and immediate demand for additional bank capital, which the private sector could not supply.
But then the same people typically smile and point out that investors from other parts of the world still want to lend the US vast amounts of money, keeping long-term interest rates low and allowing the country to run big deficits for the foreseeable future.
But modern financial history, including in emerging markets, strongly indicates otherwise.

The Bernanke-Admati-King view suggests that the Washington Fiscal Consensus is seriously deficient.
On the way to meet her, I passed women walking through mud to the market with large loads of fruit and vegetables stacked on their heads.
At the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), we believe that farming, regardless of size or scale, must be seen as a business, and smallholder farmers as small-scale business owners rather than poor people who need handouts.
As a result, yields are generally too low to allow the millions of rural households to generate marketable surpluses.
Each link in the value chain, from the smallholder to the local trade agents and agro-processors to regional and national markets, needs to be strengthened.
But, of course, such threats are not unique to Asia.
The world remains concerned about nuclear activities in North Korea and Iran, and there is widespread support for efforts to address these concerns by peaceful means.
We have seen the WMD Commission led by Hans Blix, the New Agenda Coalition, and Norway’s Seven Nation Initiative.
Second, the Security Council’s permanent members should begin discussions on security issues in the nuclear disarmament process. They could unambiguously assure non-nuclear-weapon states that they will not be subject to the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons.
If there is real, verified progress on disarmament, the ability to eliminate the nuclear threat will grow exponentially.
Moreover, the reserves built up over the preceding decade were, in many cases, used to offset some of the capital outflows.
The exception was China, where the renminbi held steady against the dollar, causing an initial appreciation against almost every other currency.
Complex securities that are hard to value will be sharply limited as a matter of policy.
At the same time, a renewed emphasis on maximizing the domestic market’s potential to drive growth and structural diversification – though clearly higher in the larger, higher-income developing economies – is a useful lesson of the crisis.
Social exclusion in industrial countries imposes costs throughout society that policymakers must address with effective and targeted measures.
In countries coming out of war or other conflicts, efforts at inclusion are futile in stagnant economies.
Low-income countries in the normal process of development, for example, receive steady inflows of official foreign assistance of about 3% of their gross national income.
Given lower labor costs, local businessmen could decide to invest under the conditions of uncertainty and high risk that characterize post-conflict situations.
I also renewed my support for a subsidy to companies for their ongoing employment of low-wage workers. (Singapore adopted this idea with enviable results.)
Another round of global stimulus after the downturn is over or nearly so would push world interest rates up and drive investment activity down.
Not all the instruments for creating that prosperity are known, of course.
Moreover, what others think – particularly, what rivals are doing – may have a big effect on the results of a decision and much of what others understand and plan is private, thus inaccessible.
Hedge funds, venture capital firms that actually venture into new things, and recreated merchant banks are relatively well suited to make financial decisions that require judgment, the ability to engage the unknown, and to do so over a horizon not dictated by quarterly earnings.
The Roar of the Democratic Wave
The regime’s international legitimacy is equally in a shambles.
It is necessary that the international community:
For Europe, the best option is to support the mass movement calling for regime change led by Mohammed ElBaradei, the Nobel laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Events are showing that to be so. 
For a long time, the US has played an important role in keeping the global economy going.
Though oil prices have been dampened for now, a robust recovery could send them soaring again.
It is not as if there was a shortage of needs; it is only that those who might meet those needs have a shortage of funds.
This year will be bleak.
Countries across Africa – including Ghana, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda – are showing early signs of success.
Second, development requires both money and the right conditions.
Those who are willing to engage often demand steep risk premiums that dramatically increase the cost of capital, often to usurious levels.
HONG KONG – Building and maintaining the infrastructure of property rights – the rules, laws, registers, and administrative and judicial structures that define, protect, and enforce such rights and regulate economic transactions – has traditionally been the responsibility of national governments.
After all, the state determines the supply of fiat money and is responsible for energy and natural-resource conservation.
The former implements policy decisions, based on economic, social, and political considerations, while profit-maximizing behavior – anchored by the state-determined price and requiring a robust PRI – determines the latter.
Herein lies the dilemma (one that China currently faces) of market-oriented reforms.
Irresponsible borrowing by governments in international credit markets requires irresponsible lending.
Government bonds, on the other hand, have no covenants.
Lending to states thus involves unfathomable risks that ought to be borne by specialized players who are willing to live with the consequences.
And, because much of the risk is borne by banks (rather than by, say, hedge funds), which play a central role in lubricating the payments system, a sovereign-debt crisis can cause widespread harm.
CAMBRIDGE – The US Federal Reserve’s desperate attempts to keep America’s economy from sinking are remarkable for at least two reasons.
The Fed pumped money into the US economy and slashed its main interest rate – the Federal Funds rate – from 3.5% in August 2001 to a mere 1% by mid-2003.
After all, if they defaulted on their loans, the banks would repossess the house at a higher value.
Banks’ balance sheets were by then filled with vast amounts of risky mortgages, packaged in complicated forms that made the risks hard to evaluate.
If it pushes too hard on continued monetary expansion, it won’t prevent a bust but instead could create stagflation – inflation and economic contraction.
As early as October 2008, when the crisis first hit, China’s government adopted a comprehensive policy package designed to prevent the economy from sliding further.
Moreover, the Chinese economy was in good shape when the global crisis hit.
That is true for developed economies no less than for a developing economy like China.
The Rules of Reconstruction
To succeed, the transition to peace requires demobilization, disarmament and reintegration of former combatants, as well as reconstruction and rehabilitation of services and infrastructure.
Elsewhere, however, disregarding the primacy of politics in a transition to peace has had tragic consequences.
Early efforts to privatize Iraq’s oil industry proved disastrous, confirming for many Iraqis that the occupying Americans were determined to “steal” the country’s wealth and thus fanning the flames of violent resistance.
Oil and gas prices are sky high, the United States is overwhelmed by serious problems in Iraq and the Middle East, and the West is divided about how it should deal with Russia.
Should instability ignite into open warfare, Russia will find it impossible to avoid the consequences.
Though Putin barely implied that the dog’s superiority indicates Russia’s domination over the US, his remark appears to be in line with his general message: don’t you ever dare to doubt our high status.
DENVER – As Russian and American diplomats prepare for a Syrian peace conference, the Middle East is experiencing convulsions not seen since the Arab Spring two years ago.
There will be no medals for effort.
US President Barack Obama was wise to have invited Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a NATO ally, to Washington for talks on Syria and the impending peace conference.
Today, Sunnis in Iraq’s Anbar province, inspired by their brethren in neighboring Syria, are organizing “tribal armies” to do battle with the Iraq national army – a challenge to central authority that no leader could ignore.
Following the Russian-Georgian war, the West is scared that Russia’s government will use its cash not just for economic purposes, but as an aggressive foreign policy tool.
The government’s Reserve Fund, created to cushion the economy from a fall in oil prices, stands at $140 billion, and the National Welfare Fund, intended mainly to solve the coming pension crisis, holds another $30 billion.
But no investment by a private Russian company has, so far, been vetoed by Western governments.
The key benefit of Russian foreign investment is not economic, but that it helps Russia become a global citizen.
Sarkozy is a man prone to following his instincts.
The same cannot be said of Sarkozy, despite his claims to the contrary.
But the global economy is slowing down, and financial markets went into a tailspin during the summer.
Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are off-limits because their bonds no longer rate as investment-grade, which means that banks are not allowed to sell them to individual savers.
Indeed, stock markets are tanking precisely because investors fear that ever-increasing risk premia in the eurozone’s peripheral countries will force them to stop consuming and investing, leading to lower German rates and thus inducing German households to reduce their consumption as well.
But even the creation of a European Monetary Fund cannot save the world economy if confidence between China and the US breaks down.
As a result, board members owe their loyalty to the managers who directly or indirectly appoint them – and thus have little incentive to dissent, lest they be punished with exclusion.
And even that would not suffice.
That is a peculiar notion of accountability.
The Science of Acupuncture
The Cochrane Collaboration, an international non-profit organization providing healthcare information, conducted a systematic review of the benefits of acupuncture, including 14 trials, of which 10 were conducted in China, involving 1,208 patients.
Part of the problem in China is choosing the patients to be studied.
More high-quality trials are needed.
Moreover, America’s ongoing demographic transformation makes it harder for candidates who are unable to reach out strongly to Latinos and other minority communities – something that Romney singularly failed to do – to carry the country.
The world’s emerging-market economies are in better shape; but, while their underlying trend growth in potential output is much higher than that of the advanced economies, there is no cyclical de-coupling.
But the concentration of income at the top – more than 90% of the gains from US economic growth in 2011, for example, went to the top 1% – is constraining broad-based recovery and leaving macroeconomic policy caught between the need for continued “stimulus” and the dangers of growing public debt and asset bubbles inflated by record-low interest rates.
One hopes that the US Congress will recognize this as well, leading to support for measures that could help hundreds of millions of people in the US and around the world.
The contraction applies not only to output and employment, as in a normal recession, but to debt and credit, and the deleveraging that typically takes many years to complete.
If governments that retain strong credit ratings are to spend scarce resources effectively, the most effective approach is to catalyze debt workouts and reductions.
These are times when central banks need to spend some of the credibility that they accumulate in normal times.
Mr. Greenspan was a strong believer, in practice if not in theory – for who could understand his theory? – that central bankers should speak in an opaque and convoluted dialect.
Voters and politicians today, it seems, fear inflation and are willing to accept occasional economic recessions and unemployment above its natural rate as unfortunate but inevitable consequences of the necessary and beneficial pursuit of long-term price stability.
So we really don't know whether we should tell central bankers to brush up on their Greenspanese.
Its value to Massachusetts is exemplified in the Commonwealth’s post-independence state constitution, ratified in 1780, which includes a section about the university’s function and boundaries.
Inspired by Harvard’s success, other universities – starting with Yale University and the College of William and Mary – took similar action.
Given their intimate knowledge of the university, alumni are also the most effective leaders.
As we struggled, continued secrecy allowed an explosion of corruption and abuse of office.
Other countries that performed well include Peru and Mexico, both of which adopted freedom of information laws in 2002, shortly after Romania.
Indeed, this has become a sine qua non of democratic government throughout the world.
But, in the former communist bloc, the benefits brought by transparency have been undeniable.
And yet the friends to whom I spoke encouraged me to get circumcised.
She sat on a traditional stool and spread her legs wide apart.
Only last month, in Narok, the town nearest my childhood village, a 13-year-old girl died after undergoing circumcision as a preparation for her marriage to a man who already had five wives.
At the same time, much more needs to be done to combat the practice, in Kenya and everywhere in Africa where it continues.
One might think that a country that owns foreign oil can use the profits from sales to insulate its economy from high world oil prices.
For example, in large countries like the United States or China, which account for a significant portion of world demand, the world price of oil is likely to be high when the country is growing strongly and citizens have lots of income, whereas the price is likely to be low when the country is doing poorly.
Indeed, one can imagine black marketeers and smugglers buying where grain is available and transporting it to sell to countries where it is not.
But the manner in which they are growing is dramatically different.
According to this “law” – which is now conventional wisdom – industrialization is the only route to rapid economic development for developing countries.
This indicates that services are not simply responding to domestic demand (which would be higher in China), but also to export opportunities.
The globalization of services, however, provides alternative opportunities for developing countries to find niches, beyond manufacturing, where they can specialize, scale up, and achieve explosive growth, just like the industrializers.
In August 1982, Mexico threatened to default, and was quickly followed by other large borrowers, notably Argentina and Brazil.
Brady’s plan looked like a great success.
That may have been plausible, but the two banks also wanted to demonstrate publicly that they had better balance sheets than their weaker rivals.
There is certainly plenty of frustration about the implementation of austerity, and no real indication of the long-term sustainability of reform efforts in southern Europe.
The Shadow of Depression
For example, labor-force participation, which usually stops falling and starts rising after the business-cycle trough, has been steadily declining over the past two and a half years.
Rather, the risk stems from governments’ refusal, when push comes to shove, to match aggregate demand to aggregate supply in order to prevent mass unemployment.

Some feel that their religion is the most important thing to them, and that that’s where their first loyalty will always lie.
The modern Pakistani identity is shaped largely by the negation of an Indian-Hindu identity and the adoption of a global pan-Islamic charter.
But this must be a debate between people, and within people.
That is a national idea worth striving for – and Pakistan’s intellectuals, its elite, and its youth must be at the forefront of the battle.
Most analysts forecast that GDP will contract in the first half of 2008 and recover in the second half of the year.
Third, the US is experiencing its most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.
While a global recession will be averted, a severe growth slowdown will not.
Moreover, even under the most optimistic scenario, the US and the world will still be relying mainly on conventional fossil fuels until the hydrocarbon era comes to an end (which few of us will live to see).
Asia has led the way, but the past five years have been the best Latin American and Africa have enjoyed in decades.
For now, though, instead of whining about high commodity prices, governments should be shielding only their very poorest citizens, and letting the price spikes serve as a wake-up call for the rest of us.
Earlier this month, jihadi terrorists ambushed an Egyptian military base in Sinai, killing 16 Egyptian soldiers.
Israelis complained about Mubarak’s “cold peace,” but they appreciated that he adhered to the treaty’s fundamental provisions.
Moreover, Israel has practically abandoned any hope of receiving agreed gas supplies from Egypt, and has not pressed its demand that Egypt block the passage of sophisticated weapons to Gaza.
Having lost Syrian backing, it is hoping that the Egyptian Brothers will provide its kindred movement with political and logistical support.
Hamas and the Bedouins in Sinai have most likely been emboldened by the latest developments in Cairo.
Just as single mothers were irrationally castigated then, so today an equally irrational hagiography has risen around them. (Europe has more single mothers than the US, but, characteristically, has less need to moralize about them one way or the other).
The glorification of single mothers represents a collective exasperation on the part of women in America – and women who make decisions in the mainstream media.
This trend hardly signifies the end of civilization as we know it; all things being equal, most women would still prefer the simple fantasy of a supportive partner in childrearing.
The spread of irrigated farming and water-intensive industries, together with the demands of a rising middle class, have led to a severe struggle for more water.
Even denial of hydrological data in a critically important season can amount to the use of water as a political tool.
Diversion of the Brahmaputra’s water to the parched Yellow river is an idea that China does not discuss in public, because the project implies environmental devastation of India’s northeastern plains and eastern Bangladesh, and would thus be akin to a declaration of water war on India and Bangladesh.
Tibet ceased to be a political buffer when China annexed it nearly six decades ago.
Moreover, there is good reason to see inflows into emerging markets as an opportunity to strengthen domestic capital markets, rather than primarily as a threat to financial stability.
Imposing controls also spawns uncertainty about a country’s policies.
There are still huge inefficiencies in international financial markets, which remain beset by herding behavior and other pathologies.
English society was redefined as a “nation” – that is, a sovereign community of equal members.
As it spread, it carried the seeds of democracy everywhere.
The more choices for the definition of one’s identity that a society offers – and the more insistent it is on equality – the more problematic the formation of identity in it becomes.
Blaming one’s existential discomfort on external factors is a kind of self-therapy. A story is constructed, which rationalizes one’s discomfort as reflecting an awareness of some general evil.
Biased views and misconceptions among market participants introduce uncertainty and unpredictability not only into market prices, but also into the fundamentals that those prices are supposed to reflect.
The system was so successful that people came to believe in what former president Ronald Reagan called “the magic of the marketplace” and I call market fundamentalism.
It was a shocking abdication of responsibility.
Moreover, the ability of the financial authorities to stimulate the economy is constrained by the unwillingness of the rest of the world to accumulate additional dollar reserves.
BRUSSELS – Two years after the world economy suffered a nervous breakdown in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, global financial markets remain unsettled, and the recovery that started so vigorously in 2009 seems to be stalling.
During the ten years preceding the peak of the bubble in 2007, about four million jobs were lost in the US manufacturing sector, whose share in total employment fell from more than 17% to 12%.
Labor-market flexibility is always touted as a panacea, but even the highest degree of it cannot transform unemployed realtors or construction workers into skilled manufacturing specialists.
Moreover, with the introduction of the euro, Germany had the advantage of pegging its currency to Southern Europe, which was experiencing a housing boom even more extreme than in the US, thus providing German exporters with growing markets and little competition.
For much of Africa, this turn of events should mark a decisive break with endemic poverty.
One remembers the 1960’s, when the global economy’s “long boom”gave Africa a chance to save its surpluses, invest in value-added industries, and increase productivity.
Elite networks continue to conspire with foreign interests to cannibalize their economies and retain the perquisites of power: fleets of luxury cars, private jets, bank accounts in tax havens, overseas properties, consumer goods, weaponry, etc.
However sad and painful it is to admit, a fleet of slave ships docking on Africa’s shores today would be overrun by willing would-be deportees.
Financial deregulation – together with easy money – had contributed to excessive risk-taking.
Indeed, a typical full-time male worker’s income is lower than it has been in more than four decades.
The financial system has become even more concentrated, exacerbating the problem of banks that are not only too big, too interconnected, and too correlated to fail, but that are also too big to manage and be held accountable.
Fiscal stimulus was replaced by austerity, with predictable – and predicted – adverse effects on economic performance.
COPENHAGEN – If you had $75 billion to spend over the next four years and your goal was to advance human welfare, especially in the developing world, how could you get the most value for your money?
In total, such an investment would help more than 100 million children to start their lives without stunted growth or malnourishment.
By not sharing their food with intestinal parasites, they, too, would become more alert, stay longer in school, and grow up to be more productive adults –&nbsp;another cause that needs much more public attention.
This would allow us to understand better the technology’s risks, costs, and benefits.
By radically simplifying the myriad combinations of start and end points – the only routes were to and from Memphis – all of the packages could be delivered the next day reliably.
And so on.
They argue, further, that it is too complicated to respect individuals’ preferences, too difficult to tell them how their data is being used, and pointless to treat them as individuals.
Mint does the same for my financial data; WellnessFX for my blood biomarkers.
But consider all of the qualitative services and conditions for which individuals have different preferences, needs, and outcomes that are now more predictable.
The ILO is a tripartite organization with representatives of labor, government, and business.
The second issue concerns the unbalanced intellectual property provisions (TRIPs) of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, dictated by America's pharmaceutical and entertainment industries.
In still other areas, the Commission's report argues for more "balanced" perspectives.
This is a message the world would do well to heed, lest discontent with globalization continue to grow.
Indeed, does my friend have a right to their time? He told me that he had actually sat in a breakout group with 20 people, each of whom he wanted to meet, but he managed to talk to only two of them.
It turns out that Anderson is working on the answer to precisely this problem of asymmetry in introductions.
The service, currently in beta, is not an app; it is a full-featured workflow tool that will use machine learning over time.
Maybe my friend was lucky to speak with only two of the 20 people in his breakout group.
The private sector’s growth is hemmed in by its inability to invest in economic sectors that the government still monopolizes.
Given China’s size and its rising share in the global market, macroeconomic instability there fuels volatility in global prices for basic commodities and raw materials.
In economic terms, China has no choice: it must remove the structural obstacles that stand in the way of rapid growth over the next decade or two.
Today’s buzzword in the study of life is “systems” biology.
And when it became possible to manipulate DNA in vitro, the metaphor of a “genetic program” appeared even more precise: scientists could construct experiments that corresponded to the reprogramming of cells merely by working on symbols in silicon.
Nuclear cloning, illustrated by the sheep Dolly, has made the Universal Turing Machine a highly revealing, if not all explaining, model of the cell.
Who has the right to what land?
There is something clearly wrong with that argument.
Even if some Israeli officials are guilty of a crime in encouraging settlements, does that mean that the settlers must be viewed as complicit?
The best argument that the Palestinians could make against the fence is to make it unnecessary by suppressing suicide bombings.
The Sources of Chinese Conduct
The traditionalists argue that China should assume responsibility for world affairs consistent with its status as the world’s second-largest economy, behind only the US.
Rulers who rely mostly on military or economic might divorced from morality, he argued, cannot achieve long-term success on the international stage.
In February 2010, at “Spring Festival” – one of China’s biggest holidays, marked by family reunions – Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said that the government should help people live with dignity and happiness.
But what of the future? The recent rise in long-term interest rates is just the beginning of an increase that will punish investors who are seeking extra yield by betting on long-term bonds.
A higher rate of expected inflation would also cause the total nominal rate to be greater than 5%.
The relatively low interest rates on both short-term and long-term bonds are now causing both individual investors and institutional fund managers to assume duration risk and credit-quality risk in the hope of achieving higher returns.
Had they managed even a few more attacks similar to the ones on New York and Washington, they could have done serious damage.
While necessary in some form to protect the country, the war on terror as it played out has served to divert America’s attention and resources from the problems that it must solve in order to ensure its future prosperity and power.
New York – As spring comes to America, optimists are seeing “green sprouts” of recovery from the financial crisis and recession.
That model has broken down, and will not be replaced soon.
Repeating the Savings ampamp; Loan debacle of the 1980’s. the banks are using bad accounting (they were allowed, for example, to keep impaired assets on their books without writing them down, on the fiction that they might be held to maturity and somehow turn healthy).
Even &nbsp;were banks healthy, the deleveraging process and the associated loss of wealth means that, more likely than not, the economy will be weak.
America’s strategy for fixing its financial system is costly and unfair, for it is rewarding the people who caused the economic mess.
MADRID – “How difficult it is to die!”
In Argentina, despite the disaster of Juan Perón’s return to power in 1973, after an 18-year exile, Perónism was reincarnated in the 1980’s in the presidency of Carlos Saúl Menem, and again with the arrival of President Néstor Kirchner and, later, his wife, current President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.
Indeed, what was good enough for “Santa Evita,” as the Argentine writer Tomás Eloy Martínez called her, might be good enough for Chávez.
Did “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il suffer a heart attack in bed, or, more nobly, on a train trip while working for the welfare of his beloved people? Allegations of poisoning by the wicked imperialists are, of course, a feature of the official Kim death story.
A global food crisis.
I see a danger of retreating from the progress we have made, particularly in the realm of economic development and fairness in sharing the fruits of global growth.
Pledges have not been honored.
It may now have faded from the headlines.
We see the fruits in Nepal, Kenya and, we hope, Zimbabwe.
We must think about a new global economic order that more fully reflects the changing realities of our time.
By then, we need a shared vision of a new global climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012.
By doing so, we will set the stage for a new era of stability and global prosperity, more widely and equitably shared.
As I recall, the three of us sipped Diet Cokes, served by a Playboy bunny.
He was no longer our competitor inside our market; he was one of us, outside in a bigger, alien world, explaining our immature little industry and products to a much broader public than we could ever reach – or influence – on our own.
Openness is great, and a strategy I normally applaud: no single vendor is likely to be the best, so openness allows a broad range of suppliers to compete and differentiate so the best can emerge.

Then America’s businesses and investors discovered the Internet.
PARIS – Could the financial crisis of 2007-2008 happen again? Since the crisis erupted, there has been no shortage of opportunities – in the form of inadequate conclusions and decisions by officials – to nurture one’s anxiety about that prospect.
It worked then, but it cannot work now, in large part because it contributed to the new, looming crisis in financial markets brought on by countries’ soaring public-debt burdens.
The euro is an important collective step forward, but to insure its credibility as a truly common currency, it should be treated as the embodiment of a true and whole-hearted solidarity.
But the necessary financial measures can no longer be implemented while respecting states’ traditional and full sovereignty.
In October the US was on the cusp of the most significant turning point for inflation in the last 20 years.
Indeed, it seems unlikely that governments in China and similar emerging markets can compensate swiftly enough to boost domestic consumption.
But if nominal interest rates stay positive, while inflation is negative, then real interest rates may become too high for an economy in recession, causing recession to become more severe and prolonged.
Finally, there are two major differences between the 1930’s and the present.
Many African countries have used the past decade to put in place sound and sustainable economic policies that have delivered robust growth and low inflation. Together with debt relief, these policies have resulted in low levels of public debt, relatively sound financial systems, and – most important – rising living standards.
My view is that strong policies on the African side, with strong support from the international community, offer the best prospects for sustained growth and poverty reduction in Africa.
We are working closely with our 53 African members on crafting the appropriate policy response.
Our shared objective is clear: to ensure that Africa not only weathers the immediate storm, but emerges from it stronger.
We also know beyond doubt that emissions from human activities have substantially increased the amount of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) in our atmosphere.
Polls of climate researchers, as well as analysis of thousands of scientific publications, consistently show a 97-98% consensus that human-caused emissions are causing global warming.
But, before millions of people are submerged, many will be struck by extreme weather events.
Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang – the top two officials in China’s new governing council (the Standing Committee of the Politburo) – are both well educated, well traveled, and sophisticated thinkers who bring a wealth of experience to the many challenges that China faces.
Indeed, having overseen China 2030 – an extraordinary joint report recently produced by the World Bank and China’s own high-level think tank, the Development Research Center – he has a deep understanding of the roadmap that China must embrace.
In fact, China is emerging in reasonably good shape from yet another global slump.
As is the case in any country’s leadership transition, no one knows for certain whether China’s incoming administration is up to the multiplicity of challenges that they face.
·        Positive stress, for which a person feels rewarded by surmounting a challenge.
Repeated stress causes neurons in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex to shrink and lose connections with other nerve cells, while it also causes neurons in the amygdala to grow and form new connections.
Although the causes of these gradients of health are very complex, they are likely to reflect, with increasing frequency at the lower end of the scale, the cumulative burden of coping with limited resources and stressors as well as differences in lifestyle, and the resulting allostatic overload that this burden places on the physiological systems involved in adaptation and coping.
In fact, one would be hard pressed to find broad agreement with Hollande’s assessment anywhere in Europe.
Austerity reduced the number of employed workers, particularly those with low skill and productivity levels.
Europe must find more effective policies that reduce production costs toward German levels.
After all, a fixed exchange rate or common currency requires limits on fiscal independence.
In the 1990’s, its corporate sector was plagued by “triangular debts” (when a manufacturer that has not been paid for its product is unable to pay its suppliers, which in turn struggle to pay their suppliers).
At the end of 2011, China’s Treasury-bond debt stood at ¥7.2 trillion, and its ratio of foreign debt to foreign-exchange reserves reached 21.8%, having grown by 27% since 2010.
The latter two are difficult to liquidate.
China’s non-financial corporate debt accounts for roughly 62% of total debt – 30-40% higher than in other countries.
The world watches and wonders whether China will follow Japan’s path and emerge as a fully modern yet peacefully inclined country.
Although reconnaissance flights by Russia’s Air Force frequently occur in Japan’s northern skies, both countries understand the need for caution in their actions.
South of Okinawa is Yonaguni Island, with a population of just 1,800 and visible from Taiwan on a clear day.
By controlling the sea lanes, China hopes to gain leverage over India’s capacity for economic growth.
The Struggle for Syria
The current regime in Syria, in its ruthless quest to remain in power, refuses to acknowledge peaceful protesters' demands for freedom and dignity.
For them, peaceful, gradual change is the best option. And that requires a national dialogue, overseen by the international community, aimed at bolstering internal unity – and thus at protecting the country from regional interference.
In fact, this seasonal upsurge in sugar consumption is just part of a huge transition in world health that is now underway.
Many countries are now afflicted by a double burden of diseases.
Education ministers should demand healthy school meals.
The growing NCD and CVD burden is a time bomb for world health.
Pakistan desperately needs the EU’s vaunted expertise in police training.
Sensing Zardari’s weakness, his main rival, Nawaz Sharif, is said to be plotting a political comeback.
But, in order to be taken seriously by the US, the EU needs to bring well-developed, well-resourced policies to the table, rather than 27 half-baked ideas. So a second reason for revamping the EU’s Pakistan policy is to be able to help shape US policy rather than be a passive by-stander.
If the EU wants to be a serious global player to which the US turns as a credible partner (showing up at its summits, for a start), the Pakistan-EU summit is a good opportunity to start replacing words with action.
Unfortunately, the two countries stand on opposing sides on climate change.
The Chinese acknowledge that they enabled Americans to borrow and spend beyond their means by parking China’s massive foreign reserves in US government securities.
Indeed, Chinese trade and investment are spurring market activity in North Korea’s northern region.
MEXICO CITY – The Summit of the Americas, which takes place roughly every three years, could be viewed as the sort of Latin American boondoggle that convenes heads of state for a few days, either south or north of the Rio Grande, to make endless speeches that lead nowhere.
Obama did not take the bait: an accidental photo opportunity or public debate with Raúl Castro in the middle of an election campaign is not how a US president wins a second term.
Nevertheless, whereas only a smattering of political leaders and intellectuals advocated legalization in the past, nowadays officials are coming “out of the closet” on drugs in droves. Those who used to say that they favored a debate on the issue now support legalization; those who opposed it now accept the need for debate; and those who continue to oppose legalization do so on moral, rather than rational, grounds.
That dignity is vanishing.
These links raise the question of the real objective of the Japanese police, a bureaucratic behemoth, in their investigation of the Sumo circle.
The gangs then upheld classic Japanese virtues of manliness and loyalty – and paid for mistakes by slicing off one of their fingers in atonement.
The Sumo gambling scandal, indeed, may be a prelude to it.
Thus, there is a well-founded fear that the planet’s natural resources (broadly defined) and recuperative capacities will not withstand the pressure.
As a result, many developed countries have built up dangerously large public debts and even larger non-debt liabilities, owing to unsustainable growth patterns.
If sustainability is to triumph, it must be predominantly a bottom-up process.
In a similar way, transportation can become less energy-intensive without restricting mobility.
The Suzuki Alliance
Currently, Maruti Suzuki India Limited has more than 4,000 employees and a nationwide sales network of 337 dealers with 8,600 salespersons.
Today, however, Japanese driving schools suffer from a fall-off in students, which cannot be explained solely by declining population.
The key point today is that the governments in both India and Japan are keen on developing their strategic consensus about Asia’s future, a fact underscored by the many bilateral discussions between defense and military officials of both countries that are taking place.
The Geneva Conversion
More broadly, America’s supply of moralistic – and even churlish – advice to the rest of the world has greatly exceeded international demand for it.
Call it a “reset” button – like the one then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave to Lavrov in 2009 – or whatever one wants.
The world needs all hands on deck – not only Russian and American, but also Arab, Chinese, European, and anyone else’s.
But even in the US, losers’ losses are outweighed by winners’ gains.

Greg Mankiw thought a bunch of reporters were coming to talk to him about the state of the economy and the analysis made by the Council of Economic Advisers in its “2004 Economic Report of the President.”
What can we do about this? The answer is simple, and it is a matter of demand, not supply.
According to this view, every great power needs obedient satellite countries.
Whenever Russia applies pressure, he immediately starts yelling about Moscow’s “ingratitude” – proclaiming that “10,000,000 Belarusians protect Russia from NATO’s tanks.”
For Russia, this could mean (in the best case) tens of thousands of refugees or (in the worst case) the arrival of armed militias on its territory.
Bakiyev seems to have said: so, you are worried about the American military presence in Central Asia, and you want to confront it.
Here is a simple formula for assessing a country’s approach to combating terrorism: credibility + transparency + integrity of approach = legitimacy and effectiveness.
Eric Holder, the US attorney general, was even more explicit about the Times Square episode: “We know that they (the Pakistan Taliban) helped direct it.
According to Brian Fishman, a terrorism expert at the US Military Academy at West Point, the growth in suicide attacks poses a severe challenge to Pakistan, for a “whole milieu of militant groups, and individuals have come together ideologically…to embark on mission(s) that Al Qaeda set(s) for them.”
Deep and sustained anger across the country – at its demonstrated vulnerability to terror and at the multiple institutional failures that allowed such loss of life – has prompted the resignations of the Home Minister in the national government and the Chief Minister and his Deputy in the state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital.
The interrogation of the one surviving terrorist, and evidence from satellite telephone intercepts and other intelligence, has led to an emerging international consensus that the attacks were masterminded by the Wahhabi-inspired Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist group once patronized, protected and trained by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) as a useful instrument in their country’s proxy war against India in Kashmir.
Though some hotheads in India now call for military action, including strikes on terrorist facilities in Pakistani territory, this would certainly lead to a war that neither side could win.
The Terror Next Door
Saudi Arabia, unlike Yemen, has supposedly created a “model” system for reintegrating and re-educating Guantánamo returnees.
Since then, Yemeni labor has been banned from Saudi Arabia.
Yet there are things the Saudis can do to vaccinate themselves, and Yemen, from fanaticism.
But if Yemen’s masses are not to become more radicalized, they will need to be incorporated into an economic zone that offers hope for the future.
While these pseudo-religions collapsed, a benevolent ideology of social democracy dominated much of Europe.
This change in political direction coincided with ­- indeed, was perhaps responsible for - the process that we now call globalization.
Indeed, it was no more than an episode.
If Schroeder gave way to the Christian Democrats, indeed even if President Bush lost to his Democrat challenger, this would not imply the dawn of a new age.
The European house is ablaze, and Downing Street is calling for a rational and resolute response by the fire brigade.
As a consequence, chaos looms in Greece, as does the prospect of subsequent bank runs in Spain, Italy, and France – and thus a financial avalanche that would bury Europe. And then?
Ultimately, that means guaranteeing the eurozone’s survival with Germany’s economic might and assets: unlimited acquisition of the crisis countries’ government bonds by the European Central Bank, Europeanization of national debts via Eurobonds, and growth programs to avoid a eurozone depression and boost recovery.
Do we Germans understand our pan-European responsibility? It certainly does not look that way.
Had the majority of legislators gotten their way, many of Poland’s 3.2 million Jews would have gone meatless.
Shechita is an indispensable, non-negotiable part of Jewish religious life.
Granted, the term sounds archaic; but the Torah is the first systematic legislation that forbids cruelty to animals and mandates that they be treated with consideration and respect.
Likewise, in Poland, following a Constitutional Court ruling in November 2012 that struck down on technical grounds a provision permitting religious slaughter, the government promised that the practice would remain legal.
For my part, and for many years now, I have tried to highlight the sweet.
Indeed, only after the US-led invasion did Iraq become a breeding ground for terrorists.
Only years after the war began did the administration order the specially armored vehicles that would have saved the lives of many killed by roadside bombs. Not wanting to reintroduce a draft, and finding it difficult to recruit for an unpopular war, troops have been forced into two, three, or four stress-filled deployments.
The war has had only two winners: oil companies and defense contractors.
And it may seem particularly self-absorbed to focus on the economic costs to America, which embarked on this war in violation of international law.
Each day, these diseases kill 16,000 people—devastating entire communities and plummeting countries deeper into poverty.
Stemming the spread of this deadly trio of diseases is the linchpin in the global fight against poverty.
Since the Global Fund was founded three years ago, it has built an impressive track record: approving 310 grants totaling $3.1 billion in 127 countries and disbursing $920 million since 2002. Despite the scope of its mission, it has a minimal bureaucracy, which allows for a flexible response to changing needs.
But will the resulting loss in purchasing power bring an end to the Japanese economy’s fragile recovery, as many fear?
What is required is easy fiscal policy today, together with plans to achieve fiscal rectitude in the long run.
Such a gradual path has positive implications for monetary policy, too.
As in Japan, such measures would enhance long-run fiscal sustainability without weakening demand at a time when the economy has not yet fully recovered from the Great Recession.
Bold measures like those envisaged by Abenomics may help.
Tobin was concerned about excessive fluctuations in exchange rates.
Meanwhile, investors with longer time horizons going after significant returns would not be much deterred by the tax.
Others argued that such a tax fails to target the underlying incentive problems in financial markets, as if we had an effective, well-proven alternative to achieve that end.
For all of these problems we will need other macroeconomic and financial remedies.
Given that outstanding loans already amount to nearly double China’s GDP – a result of the country’s massive stimulus since 2008 – new loans are largely being used to pay off old debts, rather than for investment in the real economy.
Given that China was moving toward such reforms before the 2008 global economic crisis prompted former Premier Wen Jiabao to launch his ¥4 trillion stimulus plan, Xi’s statement suggests that the new government will seek to restore the economy’s pre-2008 fundamentals.
But, over the last decade, structural changes to China’s economy have caused unemployment pressure to decline significantly – a trend that can be corroborated by across-the-board wage increases.
They then transported Tuychiyev to a police station in Angren, 100 kilometers south of the capital.
Two months prior to the gathering, a United Nations special reporter published a paper condemning Uzbekistan for “widespread and systematic” use of torture.
Those who have been released prefer to keep silent about their experiences.
The Tragedy of President Chen
The world has largely deserted Taiwan and its 23 million people – the only democracy among 1.2 billion Chinese.
As a result, big international corporations and Wall Street banks now flock to China, bypassing Taiwan.
Instead, Chen’s futile effort to “de-Sinicize” Taiwan created a wastefully divisive contentious society, pitting “mainlanders” and “locals” against each other.
But instead of finishing his career in triumph, or at least with an ovation, he was ejected from the final for head-butting an Italian player.
Zidane offered neither of these romantic images.
At a time when, in France as in the rest of the world, the chasm between the elite and ordinary people has never been so wide, when the smugness of the affluent has never been so cruelly felt by the less fortunate, Zidane, a son of despised immigrants, became an international star, and yet preserved the simplicity of his origins.
How should we assess the state of transatlantic relations nowadays? With a nod to Wall Street, we can say that the Alliance is up, Europe is flat, and the United States is clearly down.
He is the son of immigrants, the outsider whose rise to the top is living proof of French openness.
While Sarkozy claims that Europe is his priority, his methods seem to contradict his intentions.
In this new context, solidarity is as crucial as ever.

But his command of detail and argument was rock solid.
The truth appears to be that his muse deserted him sometime in the first year of his presidency.
He is not a man whose identity was handed to him by birth.
And if he is elected, it is this man who will govern.
More importantly, they are needed in the long term, because a world crowded with 6.8 billion people (and rising) simply cannot sustain economic growth unless it adopts sustainable technologies that economize on scarce natural resources.
The world’s major cities are clogged with traffic jams and pollution.
This is also a recipe for global failure, and even future conflict.
This is the time and place to launch the global drive toward sustainability.
The change is happening earlier and faster in the advertising sector, where the Internet and mobile phones are making it easier both to find out about people and their behavior and to track the ads they see and the products they buy.
With a drug, you need people who are sick, or susceptible to the condition your drug can prevent. They will come to you (often via targeted ads, as it happens, or through doctors).
Now there are a number of diagnostic tests, akin to marketers’ rules of thumb, for certain conditions.
Drug companies want to sell their drugs to everyone who could possibly benefit, and the idea of serving only a limited customer base for each drug disturbs them – even as regulators also may be slow to understand the benefits of individual drug-targeting and may not approve reimbursements for the relevant tests.
Now consider recent financial innovations.
CDSs magnified the size of the bubble by hugely speeding up the velocity of monetary circulation. The CDO market grew from $275 billion to $4.7 trillion from 2000 to 2006, whereas the CDS market grew four times faster, from $920 billion in 2001 to $62 trillion by the end of 2007.
For the counterpart of the US debt build-up was the relocation of much American manufacturing capacity to China.
Greenspan is the sacrifice they offer to the god of the market.
PARIS – In democracies, justice is supposed to be independent.
In Italy, prosecutors in Rome, following the lead of their colleagues in Milan, are now going after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
Kirchner is not above suspicion, but the judges’ lack of a watertight legal case raises suspicions of a political motive.
His targets, however, almost invariably come from the political right.   But rather than pursuing such an open ideological agenda, most activist magistrates tend to act as a corporation: their motives can be politicized, but their professional, guild interests come first.
Democracy is supposedly based on a separation and balance of institutional power.
This Kafkaesque turn of events was possible because Pavel has mental health issues in a system that refuses to protect his rights.
But when he was subsequently detained in a psychiatric hospital, the Russian government refused to allow the lawyer access to his client.
The ECHR has now cleared a path for the tens of thousands of other people in Russia who suffer abuse at the hands of the very mental health system that is supposed to help them.
Europe, however, has always found it difficult to come to terms with an over-confident, let alone arrogant, Germany.
In the first round of French presidential elections, the extreme right and left received more than 30% of the vote, with Martine Le Pen’s anti-EU National Front threatening to supplant the center-right Union for a Popular Movement as the country’s new mainstream rightist party.
Spain’s capacity to withstand an austerity “cure” that only sinks it deeper into recession must also have its limits.
Students organized a small rally in the old Vyšehrad cemetery, the burial grounds of Smetana and Dvořák in a fortress overlooking the city.
The theme music was the Velvet Underground.
Here were our children, bloodied and beaten. Here were our children, finally, victorious.
Slowly, it snaked down the medieval streets behind Prague Castle and into the square in front of the president's palace.
Never in my life have I seen anything so beautiful. I doubt I ever will again.
Keynes argued not only that markets are not self-correcting, but that in a severe downturn, monetary policy was likely to be ineffective.
US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has tried hard to avoid having the blame fall on the Fed for deepening this downturn in the way that it is blamed for the Great Depression, famously associated with a contraction of the money supply and the collapse of banks. 
The Federal government has assumed trillions of dollars of liabilities and risks.  In rescuing the financial system, no less than in fiscal policy, we need to worry about the “bang for the buck.”
Has there been a change of heart, or only a change in strategy? After all, in today’s context, the pursuit of Keynesian policies looks even more profitable than the pursuit of market fundamentalism!
Like Bo, both men had been members of the CCP Central Committee, the Party’s inner circle – a status that allowed them to escape a death sentence (unlike the lower-ranking former Minister of Railways Liu Zhijun following his conviction on similar charges of corruption and abuse of power).
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has already scrapped charges of illicit sexual relations involving several women, signaling that such crimes are to remain hidden when Central Committee members commit them.
Their tragedy stands as a profound indictment of the CCP’s rule, because no family is safe when governments are not subject to the rule of law.
O, you are men of stones.”
And, for a little more than a decade, from 1997-2007, this hope was realized.
And, incidentally, the current agitation about interest rates is a bit over the top.
These could be justified during the recession of 2008-2009, but now they have become counter-productive, because they undermine the markets’ controlling function.
PARIS – America’s presidential election campaign is being followed in Europe with passionate interest.
America is no longer the protector or model that it used to be, nor is it alone in terms of influence and power.
The implicit question behind some European reservations about Obama may be formulated in one question: “Will we have to do more in Afghanistan and beyond?”
So Europeans are right to be fascinated by America’s presidential election.
With the economic policies Taylor criticizes, this mechanism simply does not exist.
And that is one thing they will never do.
There is indeed something wrong with today’s interest rates.
The problem is not the 12 Class-A war criminals interred at the shrine; the real problem is the Yushukan military museum next door.
My exposure to the Japanese right came in the early 1990’s, when I was on a couple of panels in Japan with Watanabe Soichi, who was selected by my Japanese publisher (unbeknownst to me) to translate my book The End of History and the Last Man into Japanese.
Since the final days of the Cold War, the US has been pushing Japan to rearm, and has officially supported a proposed revision of Article 9 of the postwar constitution, which bans Japan from having a military or waging war.
A clear example is financial regulation, which in many ways is a form of paternalism.
But some amount of paternalism is necessary in civilized societies.
Sunstein and Thaler would have the employer choose a default option that works for most people, such as 60% in equities, 30% in bonds, and 10% in money-market funds.
This, then, is the nub of the problem.
The Trouble with Poland
In the nineteenth century, Europe’s southern and eastern extremities were united by common decay.
And perhaps there is another factor: there is more pride and less self-doubt in Spanish culture than in the Polish one.
By antagonizing Germany, indeed all of the EU, Poland is merely encouraging a revisionist Russia.
Sadly, there is a “disconnect” between Poland’s economic progress and the discourse and behavior of its politicians.
But that doesn’t mean that issues involving the preservation of life (or a way of life), like defense, should not be subjected to cool, hard economic analysis.
So it is no surprise that its figure of $500 billion ignores the lifetime disability and healthcare costs that the government will have to pay for years to come.
But the costs don’t stop there.
In short, even our “moderate” estimate may significantly underestimate the cost of America’s involvement in Iraq.
NEW YORK – In their preoccupation with fiscal deficits, developed-country policymakers continue to neglect a different, yet equally critical, shortfall: the trust deficit between advanced and emerging economies when it comes to global governance.
While the world economy is expected to grow by 3.3% this year, average annual growth in the advanced countries is projected to be just 1.2%.
Mexico, for example, recently adopted – ahead of schedule – the changes in capital requirements for banks recommended by the Third Basel Accord (Basel III), in order to reduce leverage and increase stability.
Many hundreds of scientists from different countries were involved as contributors and reviewers for these reports, which are probably the most comprehensive and thorough international assessments on any scientific subject ever carried out.
Such stabilization would also eventually stop further climate change.
In fact, the IEA lists many benefits that will be realized if its recommendations are followed.
As I don’t expect nations to abandon this principle, NATO will continue to depend on individual allies and their willingness to commit resources.
In Afghanistan, for example, national systems for friendly-force tracking, which are vital to preventing accidental attacks on one’s own forces or allies, are not compatible.
During the past couple of years, NATO’s funding policy has been updated to allow common funding to be used as an incentive for the provision of certain theater-level enabling capabilities, like medical facilities, airports handling troops and supplies, or intelligence.
The extraordinary international response to the tsunamis that devastated South Asia is a remarkable political phenomenon.
In contrast, the countries that are most generous – Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and tiny Luxemburg – give proportionately far more than American governmental and private assistance combined, and the lion’s share of their aid goes to the world’s most impoverished countries.
Another question likely to loom large in coming months is whether assistance is politicized and free of corruption.
Yet it was never able to use the former to advance the latter.
While it is too early to predict the final outcomes, several important regional implications are already beginning to emerge.
Many Arabs regard the brand of moderate Islam espoused by Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as a possible model for the Middle East.
Moreover, the Turkish model owes much to the leadership of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic.
As a result, the collapse of the old power structures in many Middle East countries is likely to be accompanied by considerable political turmoil and violence.
Overall, however, the movement has remained peaceful and even joyous.
That has weakened center-left parties.
The democratic opposition can address the flaws of the existing order only if it recognizes the need for very different forms of mobilization from those of the past.
Recent weeks have seen the trial of former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and the conviction of former Defense Minister Charles Pasqua.
The apex of the aristocratic Republic was reached under the Socialist President François Mitterrand, who ruled from 1981 to 1995.
So, something of a democratic revolution may be underway in France.
Today, many French journalists still resist the temptation to expose the private lives of the political elite.
French ministers have yet to be seen taking the bus or the subway to their offices.
But few international leaders face such a wide range of sworn domestic enemies.
Some in Washington charge that he has done too little to roust al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters from safe havens along the country’s border with Afghanistan.
The generals know that another coup would further weaken the military’s popular standing – as well as Pakistan’s relations with the US – at a moment when Bhutto and Sharif have raised expectations at home and abroad for a permanent return to civilian rule.
The Bush administration can therefore enthusiastically back a return to civilian rule and claim a much-needed victory for democracy in a Muslim country.
Perhaps the greatest display of this political schizophrenia took place last month in Red Square, where a witch’s brew of Red “Victory” flags, tri-color “Imperial” flags, Stalin portraits, and Orthodox icons marched side by side during the 60th anniversary celebration marking WWII’s end.
Indeed, Putin’s signature characteristic is to be all men for all Russia’s people.
He became known as “The Peasants’ Tsar,” though he didn’t tolerate any opposition thinking contrary to his own.
Like a bad driver, a nation that looks left and right but never ahead is bound to crash.
That damage is all the greater when we consider how America’s trade subsidies contributed to the demise of the Doha Round.
America and other advanced countries are the real losers from the demise of the Doha Round.
Europe’s National Wild Cards
This problem is perhaps most evident in the United Kingdom.
As a result, British officials appear more likely to develop proposals that suit only the UK, and that could give it an unfair advantage.
And the European Court of Justice would have difficulty reconciling a special set of exceptions for one country with the shared rights and freedoms on which the EU is based.
Then on 12 November, the world’s Nobel Peace Laureates will hold a summit in Hiroshima to stress the priority of nuclear disarmament and affirm their commitment to promoting it.
Yes, nuclear disarmament has gone viral.
One of the most important and overdue developments in this area is the entry into force of the CTBT, which will outlaw all nuclear explosions, regardless of their size, location, or declared purpose.
Other treaties are needed as well, especially one outlawing the production of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons.
Up to a point, this is understandable.
In July 1995, Serb forces attacked.
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning "anti-Tutsi extermination."
He is the all-time Teflon diplomat.
Annan cannot plead that he faced any risk to his personal safety, whereas Wallenberg in 1944 and 1945 was in constant peril.
As a result, even countries with good regulatory systems are now confronting problems in their financial sectors.
But many developing countries have just emerged from being overburdened with debt; they do not want to go through that again.
Emblematic of the difference between the UN and the G-20 conferences was the discussion of bank secrecy: whereas the G-20 focused on tax evasion, the UN Conference addressed corruption, too, which some experts contend gives rise to outflows from some of the poorest countries that are greater than the foreign assistance they receive.
Of course, the UN has played a leading role on climate change before now.
China and India were absent at the time, and Russia was hostile to the idea.
More than half of the 43 members of the Association of Small Island States believe that the decision to do nothing, to let ocean waters rise, can be considered tantamount to approval of murder.
But that re-boot must start now, and the UN, specifically the General Assembly, is the place to begin.
The answer, alas, is a failing grade.
Among G-8 countries, only the UK is making a bold effort to increase its overall aid budget and direct a significant portion to Africa.
First, the Gleneagles commitments might be mere words to politicians in the rich world, but they are matters of life and death for the world’s poor.
But it is tragic to spend so much money and then accomplish next to nothing in terms of concrete results and honest accountability. 
Alternative Fiscal Medicine?
But how many will become exhausted before implementing this program in full? Willingly or not, some may seek recourse to inflation or administrative measures aimed at trapping domestic savings into financing the state and keeping bond rates low (what economists call financial repression) – or, eventually, to outright debt restructuring.
Start with equity.
On distributional grounds, there does not seem to be a good reason to resort to them in lieu of relying on outright taxation.
After all, they were not the beneficiaries of the public goods or transfers financed by the issuance of debt.
But an exception can again be made: When both the private and public sectors are overburdened with debt, adjustment leads to a debt-deflation spiral, particularly when conducted under a fixed exchange-rate regime.
MADRID – Barack Obama’s first year in office has been a sobering exercise in the limits of presidential power.
But creating a structure of international relations that will make a more stable and enduring world order is not a task to be completed within one year.
The Obama administration’s failure in re-launching the India-Pakistan peace talks over Kashmir is one of the gravest weaknesses of its “AfPak” strategy.
He was commendably humble to admit that he was wrong “to have raised expectations so high.”
On the policy input side, they have specified and begun to implement purchases of securities totaling $75 billion per month (three times as much, in relative terms, as the US Federal Reserve currently purchases under its unconventional monetary-policy regime).
Japan’s aging population mutes the potential impact of both the wealth effect and animal spirits.
The required reforms, though achievable, will test the government’s resolve and implementation capabilities, as well as the population’s willingness to face immediate disruptions in exchange for the promise of longer-term gains.
In other words, a growing pie for all better accommodates all.
Within three years the US had an official report on the causes of the events of 9/11; the well-resourced expert commission that produced it identified the weaknesses of America’s national-security agencies and provided recommendations for addressing them.
The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, chaired by Phil Angelides, did produce a report on the crisis – in fact, three reports.
Unfortunately, the Commission – composed mostly of elected officials, rather than experts – wasted its time in political squabbles.
Unfortunately, they are likely to remain unanswered without a major mandatory disclosure of data.
The American comedian Jimmy Kimmel recently poked fun at his compatriots’ lack of fiscal knowledge by asking pedestrians on Hollywood Boulevard what they thought of &#160;“Obama’s decision to pardon the sequester and send it to Portugal.”
This implies that, if anything, the tax system should become more progressive, with the proceeds invested in public goods that are not sufficiently provided by the private sector –&#160;things like early childhood education and preventive health care to minimize educational disruption resulting from common ailments like childhood asthma.
Its large budget deficits reflect the impact of tax breaks that favor the wealthy and upper middle class; an unfunded expansion of Medicare coverage to include prescription medicines; two foreign wars; and, most important, a banking system that was allowed to get out of control, inflicting massive disruption on the real economy (and thus on tax revenue).
PARIS – A year ago the eurozone was in serious trouble.
The endeavor was bound to be ambitious.
Second, an agreement on authorizing the ECB to oversee the banking sector was reached at the end of last year.
There are two ways to eliminate the feedback loop.
Meanwhile, the credibility of Draghi’s atomic weapon is being undermined.
But, 60 years later, has their discovery really had the transformative impact that the world expected?
But, almost from the beginning –&#160;and most intensely since 1971, when Time magazine published a special section entitled “The New Genetics: Man into Superman” – science and society alike have tended to overestimate the impact of genetics.
Genetics has been a source of particularly high hopes when it comes to cancer treatment.
In addition, as the cancer adjusts to the drug, further mutations are likely to occur, diminishing the drug’s efficacy.
But such patents mar DNA’s “birthday” celebrations for the patients who stand to benefit from the fruits of genetic research – if only they could afford them.
The army and the police have mobilized almost 50,000 troops to carry out evictions.
While motivated by the best of intentions, the hope of reviving the road map is out of touch with reality.
In an ideal world, conflicts end by agreements and treaties. But in the real world – and Cyprus, Bosnia, and Kosovo may be examples – stabilization and the slow de-escalation of violence can sometimes achieve the same end, even without formal agreement.
As it integrates into the world economy, it must seek to sustain growth while protecting the environment and reducing poverty and inequality.
The same report warns that, if we do not change our ways, worldwide CO2 emissions will rise exponentially.
The international community counts on China to pursue that role with vigor.
But it is deeds that matter.
The EU sets all kinds of conditions for cooperation with other countries.
A readers’ poll in the Sydney Morning Herald showed 96% opposed to those proposed measures, and only 2% in support.
Reality is more complex.
Even with censorship, the Internet is a force for change.
Can’t get to a doctor?  You can check your symptoms online – but can you be sure that the medical Web site you are using is reliable?
Crucially, the Commission’s recent proposals include the creation of “mobility partnerships” with Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt, aimed at facilitating travel for local students and businesspeople.
To its credit, the European Commission also issued strong calls to member states for better legislation and practices concerning migration.
The genius of modern Europe has consisted in linking long-term stability to the pursuit of ever-deeper economic and political integration.
Nor is it merely about questioning the sources of Europe’s influence in a fast-changing world.
For starters, unanchored inflation expectations and structural difficulties might mean that efforts to boost demand show up almost entirely in faster price growth and only minimally in higher employment.
2.
But it is clear that they have not tried enough: the “stop” signal of unanchored inflation expectations, accelerating price growth, and spiking long-term interest rates – all of which tell us that we have reached the structural and expectational limits of expansionary policy – has not yet been flashed.
But that book was published in 2007 – before, presumably, his intellectual structure fell apart.
Indeed, early theorists of business cycles understood this.
It manages to combine technology-driven cycles of booms and recessions with markets that always clear (i.e., there is no unemployment).
But this was not used to finance new inventions: it was the invention.
For Schumpeter, there was something both noble and tragic about the spirit of capitalism.
The population of what is now Pakistan was about two-thirds Muslim; the remainder were mostly Hindus and Sikhs.
The large countries in this part of the Islamic world – most notably Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey – are attempting to address four problems, the most challenging of which is to define Islam’s role in the political system.
They have been mercilessly attacked in Karachi and Quetta in recent years, with more than 400 killed.
The upcoming election has both nurtured hope and generated anxiety among Pakistanis.
First, the eurozone is in deep recession, especially in the periphery, but now also in the core economies, as the latest data show an output contraction in Germany and France.
Infrastructure investment is down as well, with many high-speed railway projects on hold and local governments and special-purpose vehicles struggling to obtain financing amid tightening credit conditions and lower revenues from land sales.
The Islamic Republic, with its back to the wall as sanctions bite, could also react by sinking a few ships to block the Strait of Hormuz, or by unleashing its proxies in the region – the pro-Iranian Shia in Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, as well as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.
That is yet another reason to believe that the global economy remains far from achieving a balanced and sustainable recovery.
More than 50% of Chinese live in urban areas today, up from 25% in 1990, and the proportion is expected to reach 70% by 2035.
Workers come home from their jobs to homes that are dark, dank, and depressing.
That would have been unheard of several years ago, as would today’s growing trend among China’s urban middle classes for de-urbanization – a brain drain whereby educated city dwellers give up on the rat race and return to the countryside in pursuit of cleaner air, open spaces, and better accommodation.
McKinsey calculates that the country requires between 700-900 million square meters of new residential and commercial space each year; 350-400 kilometers (217-248 miles) of metros and subways (20 times what has been achieved in the past decade); and 19,000-25,000 kilometers of annual road construction (equivalent to all the roads built over the past ten years).
The UN Charter, initially negotiated by the US, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom during World War II, established a Security Council containing five permanent members, including France and the Republic of China.
A majority of UN member states are in favor of creating a new Council with an expanded roster of both permanent and non-permanent members.
We all stand to lose if new international crises end up being addressed by coalitions of countries at the margins of the Security Council and in a manner that flouts international law.
But Alvaro Uribe’s re-election in Colombia may not only have begun the process of reversing that tide; it has perhaps also shown conservative and liberal parties across the continent a way forward – one that may soon be tested in Mexico’s presidential vote on July 2.
The slogan meant that his government intended to free up (by military means) the country’s main road networks, even when these passed through FARC territory.
However, unlike President Alan Garcia of Peru, who Chávez may be trying to bully, Chávez has been forced to recognize Uribe’s enormous popularity.
America’s Health-Care Divide
These arguments were entirely convincing to Bismarck. They are equally convincing today.
One Republican senator – Olympia Snowe of Maine – voted for it in committee, but then switched sides, threatened to kill it via filibuster, and voted against its final passage.
What will nurses and patients denied the benefits of the ACA do?
For China, the issue largely concerns the design and implementation of the next stage of institutional reforms to sustain economic growth and efficiency, reduce social inequality, remove market distortions, address environmental deterioration, and combat corruption.
First, in both countries, the challenge is not one of state versus market, but about finding complementarities between the two.
How they use monetary, fiscal, structural, institutional, and regulatory policies may differ, but each will ultimately be judged by how close he comes to achieving that goal.
For the North, it would be suicide; for the South, with its vibrant economy and widening free-trade agreements, the opportunity cost would be particularly high.
First, the regime’s implosion would unleash a massive refugee flow, implying enormous social and economic costs.
This is a good starting point.
The candidates in US debates address carefully selected journalists who rarely follow up on a question.
It is, according to the pundits, Romney’s last chance.
If policies or prejudices have not persuaded that undecided 17% of voters, they must be looking for something else.
After all, the US presidency is a quasi-monarchical institution, as well as a political one.
Then the competition – part ideological, part beauty contest – can start all over again.
The economy is showing signs of over-heating.
This has made the central government very powerful, attracting the best brains into its service. 
Then China became embroiled with Japan in a dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku Islands.
Consider Afghanistan.
That rift is unfortunate, because improvement in Chinese living standards ought to go hand-in-hand with Chinese participation in building a better world order.
Unless a deliberate effort is made by both sides to reach a better understanding, the world faces a turbulent time in 2011 and beyond.
Of course, America is no longer what it used to be.
Obama was reelected because the Republican Party lost sight of the center in America.
At the same time, while America may no longer be the international actor that it once was, domestic production of shale oil and gas appears set to re-write the US energy equation – as it could for France and other Western countries, which may one day be able to do without the energy supplied by the Middle East.
But the idea of a “rape culture” – a concept formulated by feminists in the 1970’s as they developed the study of sexual violence – has hardly made a dent in mainstream consciousness.
Women soldiers who had served in Afghanistan came forward to speak with the filmmakers Amy Ziering and Kirby Dick, whose Oscar-nominated film The Invisible War exposed the scale of the problem.
Researchers from Stanley Milgram to Phillip Zimbardo have shown that atrocities can be committed more easily when ordinary subjects (that is, not sociopaths) become desensitized in various ways.
Indeed, most of the US military men and women I have met long to embody the role of a warrior who acts on a bright-line understanding of the difference between right and wrong.
Of the party’s dozen presidential candidates, only two (Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman) declined to reject scientific evidence concerning global warming and its human causes.
Candidate Romney was so cowed by his party’s obsession with low taxes that he never put forth a budget that added up.
One can draw two possible conclusions from America’s election.
Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.”
This belief system did not, of course, exclude the possibility of market intervention.
And, in the wider triumph of the precepts of financial deregulation and market completion, both interests and ideology have clearly played a role.
Such guiding philosophies are most compelling when they provide clear answers.
We need to have that conversation.
This&nbsp;argument is based on the latest science about dopamine’s role in arousal (as James Pfaus and his team at Concordia University in Montreal have documented), as well as on well-established summaries of the literature, such as David Linden’s The Compass of&nbsp;Pleasure.
The fact that science is finding connections between women’s sexual experience and their emotions and perception should not be cause for mockery, but for curiosity and respectful investigation of the facts.
By expanding our grasp of the vastness of the universe, science has, if anything, increased the awe and reverence we feel when we look up on a starry night (assuming, that is, that we have got far enough away from air pollution and excessive street lighting to see the stars properly).
“Dreams and Facts” concludes with these stirring words: “No man is liberated from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it is; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is capable until he has allowed himself to see his own littleness.”
So, you finally passed that crucial piece of legislation? Your fiscally responsible political party just won the election?
The importance of a competitive currency for economic growth is undeniable.
It stimulates production (and hence employment), unlike overvaluation, which stimulates consumption.
There is little to be gained from letting hot money flow into an economy freely.
PALO ALTO – Race can undoubtedly be a tricky subject, with any suggestion of genetic differences among racial groups – beyond superficial characteristics like skin color – potentially invoking memories of the nineteenth-century eugenics movement and its eventual role in Nazi ideology.
Such discoveries have enhanced researchers’ ability to enrich study populations with patients who are likely to benefit from the drug, while sparing from any possible side effects of exposure those patients who are unlikely to benefit.
Given this result, US regulators approved the treatment for marketing based on a trial of only 28 patients.
But we must fight illness with the data we have, not the data we wish we had.
Unfortunately, Sartre and Aron are also joined in death: both have been disowned, ignored, or underrated by all the academic disciplines – philosophy, literature, sociology, politics – to which their voluminous works might be thought to have contributed.
As for Zola, who defended Captain Alfred Dreyfus from charges of treason fueled by anti-Semitism, he was easily convicted for libel because he merely questioned the motives of witnesses without offering any new evidence.
The intellectual’s ethic is both exhilarating and harsh, for it places responsibility for thinking squarely on the thinker’s shoulders.
Each wanted to take French society in radically different directions, but both never ceased being critical of the status quo.
We blamed unusual wind conditions in the Arctic that year. But satellite data since then have proven us wrong.
2010 was one of the two hottest years on record globally, despite extremely low solar activity. Thus, it is almost certain that warming – including in the Arctic – will continue in the coming decades.
While future sea level is hard to predict, most experts would agree that unabated global warming could lead in the coming centuries to a rise measured in meters, threatening the very existence of many coastal cities and entire island nations. Already at the end of this century, sea level could well be one meter higher than it is now, unless we act rapidly and decisively to curb our greenhouse-gas emissions.
Today, the global picture is different.
It gives us hope that US President Barack Obama recognizes these dangers.
The Preparatory Committee will meet in New York this May, and this is where the necessary decisions should be made.
We trust that the US and Russian presidents, and leaders of all other nuclear powers, will show statesmanlike wisdom and courage and begin the process of freeing the world from the nuclear menace.
It does not.
We might see prolonged and high unemployment in the construction sector, and in regions that had seen the biggest previous construction booms.
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
The Gulf War confirmed American military might and the age-old perils of appeasement.
European strategists largely dismissed America’s interpretation that force had won the Cold War, believing that cooperation had triumphed precisely because force was absent. They heard in pleas for freedom from behind the Iron Curtain not a desire to become American, but to join the remarkably successful European experiment in collective security and prosperity that emerged after World War II.
The Kremlin trusted the West in 1989.  Subsequent Russian leaders refuse to be duped again.
But, unlike Russia, China de-emphasized the relevance of traditional hard power to achieve its goals.
Yet after five years of military exertions, strategies based on targeting a united aggressor have only made the situation worse.
Conventional military models are geared to decapitate something that, in this case, has no head.
This model is the current basis of the business world, just as centralization has also been the favored defense strategy.
Scores of texts are appearing in the Muslim world on jihadi strategic studies.
It promises to decouple the management of finance from that of production, implying faster innovation and economic growth.
Many work in piles of garbage, either removing them to another place or collecting empty bottles and cans to sell.
The deterioration of families’ financial situation has also left poor children deprived of educational opportunity.
Increasingly, Iraqi girls interpret anything given to them as a means to have sex with them.
The methods are brutal evidence of a backlash by previously subdued tribal forces that have been unleashed by the occupation: women strangled and beheaded, and their hands, arms and legs chopped off.
Ironically, the forces leading this assault on women had little or no power under Saddam Hussein.
These patrols must receive gender-sensitive training and prioritize women’s security over tribal or fundamentalist religious values.
Other Turks have faced prosecution in Western Europe for saying that it did not.
The world’s different legal systems have never been in much agreement about the boundaries of free speech.
In cases where bellicose leaders make public threats to “bury” another country (remember Khrushchev?) or to wipe it off the map, the courts should wait, it was said, until some harm occurs.
The wars in Lebanon and Gaza constitute a grave threat to democratic reform in the southern Mediterranean.
The efforts of reformist governments in the region to integrate such movements into the public sphere have been dealt a severe blow.
The European Union’s feeble response to the warfare in Gaza and Lebanon has oscillated between understanding and condemnation of the disproportionate use of force by Israel (described as “ten eyes for one” by the Finnish presidency), thereby betraying its dependence on the US to end the violence.
The current frustration is summed up by The Economist’s recent cover headline: “Grow, dammit, grow.”
Despite many financial crises and defaults, this creditor-debtor relationship worked, on the whole, to the benefit of both sides.
Cheap money in the West was the “correct” Keynesian response to the flood of saving from the East.
The principle behind this is that collective insurance would be cheaper, and therefore less deflationary, than self-insurance.
A rising tide lifts all boats; a receding one ignites a Hobbesian war of each against all.
NEW DELHI – International discussion about China’s rise has focused on its increasing trade muscle, growing maritime ambitions, and expanding capacity to project military power.
Whereas riparian neighbors in Southeast and South Asia are bound by water pacts that they have negotiated between themselves, China does not have a single water treaty with any co-riparian country.
The Metog Dam will be twice as large as the 18,300-megawatt Three Gorges Dam, currently the world’s largest, construction of which uprooted at least 1.7 million Chinese.
And China’s dam building inside Burma to generate power for export to Chinese provinces has contributed to renewed bloody fighting recently, ending a 17-year ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army and the government.
Yet they share a root cause, whereby speculative and often narrow interests have superseded the common interest, common responsibilities, and common sense.
We have only 12 short months to hammer out the elements of a global climate change accord before world leaders convene next December in Copenhagen.
Developing nations will need increased financial support to protect the poorest and most vulnerable.
In marrying the issues of economic revitalization, energy security, and climate change, Obama has articulated clearly the benefits of any Green New Deal.
But the hit of this year’s Sundance Film Festival was a low-key affair called Inequality for All, in which Robert Reich, a labor secretary in the Clinton administration, explains how rising income inequality and the demise of the middle class is causing so many Americans to suffer.
Moreover, millions of middle-class American homes are “underwater” (the mortgage is more than the home’s underlying value).
That means large investments in public education, including higher education; substantial investments in infrastructure, funded by a highly progressive tax whose top marginal effective rate never fell below 50%; and strong labor unions.
Yet, as the world’s leading finance ministers and central bankers convene in Washington this month for the semi-annual International Monetary Fund board meetings, policy paralysis continues.
The British have nearly the opposite perspective.
The inability of backward domestic financial systems to allocate investment efficiently is a big factor pushing funds out of poor countries and into the US.
Many developing countries, however, are well on their way to achieving these preconditions.
The Way Out of Iraq
In other areas, sharia law is being introduced by force.
The initiative faces a culture in which violence is so deeply embedded that children once learned arithmetic by counting numbers of dead Soviet soldiers.
We don’t hear about the workshops for women’s empowerment, or the successful organization of small-scale local elections across the country.  
But many analysts have challenged estimates that rely on the World Bank’s current poverty line, raised in 2008 from $1 to $1.25 per day, in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms.
For example, World Bank survey data suggest that India’s per capita household expenditure has grown by only 1.5% annually since the early 1990’s, implying that the average Indian spent $720 in 2010.
While the Bank’s latest PPP-conversion rate puts the number of poor Chinese at 173 million, the previous rate would suggest that only 69 million Chinese were living below the poverty line.
Glass-Steagall also strengthened regulators’ ability to clamp down on lending for real-estate and stock-market speculation.
Nor is it obvious that the bankers suffered from more adverse publicity.
Another popular argument for the success of 1930’s reform is that Congress had already agreed on a diagnosis of the problem and could build on its own earlier efforts to treat it.
National City Bank and Chase National Bank had already announced that they were liquidating their securities affiliates.
The Weary Titan
The crisis has also intensified political problems.
An increasingly uncompetitive civilian industry, the burden of military commitments overseas, wage stagnation: all signal that the American titan may be wearying.
Of course, due to its sheer military might and numerous alliances, the US will remain on top for the foreseeable future.
The welfare state was described by its intellectual architect, Lord Beveridge, as a structure built to protect the individual “from the cradle to the grave.”
The welfare state resisted its critics and the pain of stagnating economies by making collaborators of the middle class.
Osborne’s assault on the British welfare state began with the universal child subsidy, a broad-base entitlement distributed to all families with children, regardless of their incomes.
Yet popular resistance to these supposedly unfair entitlement reductions is stronger than expected.
Tensions have existed between liberty and equality ever since modern democracy placed citizenship at the root of political legitimacy.
Intervention has now been broadened to include education, culture, sport, and ethnicity, in the belief that only citizens who receive equal education and training, and have their historical and cultural specificity recognized, can enjoy genuine equality.
With the surge in unemployment in the 1970's, for example, several new categories of beneficiaries were created and subsequently modified to adapt to funding limitations.
The West’s Middle East Pillars of Sand
But this military pillar has been steadily eroded.
Likewise, 37% of the UAE’s trade is with China, India, and South Korea.
Hosni Mubarak was the lynchpin of the West’s policy: he was uncompromising with potential US enemies; he could be relied upon to appear at peace talks with the Israelis; and he could be used to add weight to the American position on Iran.
Recently, however, the Fed decided not only to keep the punch bowl in place, but to refill it.
Central banks in emerging-market countries like Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Peru, Thailand, and South Korea are providing good examples to follow.
That seems not to be the case any more.

Yet America and Europe often do not seem to see the world through the same glasses: Spain's response to the terrorist attacks - a threat common to all democracies - was to vote in a government promising an end to pro-US policy on Iraq.
The messianic idealism that liberated Europe from Nazism and protected Western Europe from communism is now directed at other enemies.
Anyone who thinks we are building a European rival to America has not looked properly at the facts.
We must forge greater European military capacities simply to put in place a mechanism that allows us to stand effectively shoulder to shoulder when terrorism or other catastrophes strike one of our democracies, as just happened.
Our task is to find a way to stand together without standing against anybody in particular.
First, software with a slight edge tends to get a significantly greater share of the available market; and, second, the available market is global, because it costs so little to make an extra copy and send it anywhere in the world.
The more that everyone has access to the same educational opportunities, the more society will tend to accept some receiving disproportionate rewards.
The billions to be made today may only be millions tomorrow.
The Wolf that Ate Georgia
By sending its troops to South Ossetia, Georgia no doubt was politically reckless, but it did not breach any international rule, however nominal its sovereignty may be.
As a result of that perilous precedent, Russia no longer feels bound by the unwritten agreement.
The Women of Europe’s Dream
Were my father to reappear suddenly and I told him that Lithuania was a member state, he would stare in disbelief and wonder what I was smoking.
Indeed, on the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, no less a Euro-luminary than Jacques Delors expressed the fear that the EU could “unravel”; Germany’s former foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, expressed similar sentiments in an interview on the BBC in early 2009.
Lagarde has other strengths.
Perhaps the greatest challenge for Europe in the twenty-first century is to bring down the walls between its non-Muslim and Muslim communities.
Some have suggested that the president’s departure is the result of his making too many waves with his anti-corruption agenda.
For example, the Bank’s recent study The Many Faces of Corruption estimates, that illegal logging causes annual losses of about $10 billion in the forestry sector.
Now, the resolution of the crisis has reassured many that the Bank can practice what it preaches.
But gutting or cutting Doing Business would be a grave error and would essentially result in throwing a healthy baby out with the bathwater.
Moreover, Doing Business helps to break down barriers – particularly in developing countries – that can discourage the establishment of small and medium-size enterprises, provide opportunities for corruption, and drive small business owners to the informal sector.
Still others have argued that Doing Business contains built-in biases against regulation and taxation, which may create incentives for countries to enact reforms that game the system rather than produce meaningful results.
Finally, while Doing Business focuses on helping the poorest countries to improve their economic performance, it also influences advanced-country policymaking and business practices.
Thus, the rollout of the American propaganda machine for Kim, who traveled to many capitals worldwide with US Treasury support and promises of American largesse, surely biased the vote against Okonjo-Iweala.
His candidacy made Okonjo-Iweala look like a regional “African candidate,” while Ocampo was the “Latin American” candidate.
Can Kim lead on these and other issues that are beyond his experience? Foreboding is in order.
We console each other when Chelsea loses, and worry together when our team plays big clubs, like recently when they played Liverpool, the only major contender that stood between Chelsea and the English title.
They want to enjoy the game, rather than sit in the company of their male relatives, oblivious to what’s happening on the pitch.
But for most African young women and girls, it’s not that simple.
Male youth soccer camps and leagues are either nonexistent or mediocre.
It seems natural to draw connections among them, especially after a “superstorm” shut down Wall Street this past October.
Facing stresses on both systems simultaneously is like losing both engines on an airplane in mid-flight.
Each case highlights the need to consider how to make systems more resilient, which means that systems cannot be considered in isolation.
MUNICH – Since last autumn, Germany has been accused by a number of Anglo-American economists, above all by the 2008 Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, of not doing enough to combat the world economic crisis and of free-riding on other countries’ stimulus programs.
While this certainly impedes long-term economic growth and causes great structural problems, it also means that the state reacts extremely counter-cyclically and stabilizes the economy to a great extent, which benefits the entire world.
The data clearly supports this view.
The World\u0027s Runaway Train
As a result, higher commodity prices are eating into fiscal cushions rather than curtailing demand.
Wait a second, you say. Why can’t our wonderfully flexible market economies roll with the punches?
For a variety of reasons, mostly related to government intervention, few emerging market economies can be categorized as having flexible resource demand, so commodity price spikes are not having a particularly big effect on demand.
It is time to put the brakes on this runaway train before it is too late.
Still others (China and Korea) exploited seemingly limitless globalization and buoyant international trade to capture growing market shares.
Facing immediate credit rationing and large output contractions, they could be stabilized only by exceptional official financing from abroad, and, in some extreme cases, by defaulting on past commitments (including to bondholders and, most recently, bank depositors).
With the political context undermining the right mix of short- and longer-term measures, national policymaking has stumbled into partial approaches and unusual experimentation.
As this requires some fundamental domestic re-alignments, the rebalancing will be both gradual and non-linear at times.
The Worst of All Worlds
But it is simply not correct that climate data are systematically worse than expected; in many respects, they are spot on, or even better than expected.
Likewise, and arguably much more importantly, the heat content of the world’s oceans has been dropping for the past four years where we have measurements.
But most models find results within the IPCC range of a sea-level increase of 18 to 59 centimeters (7-23 inches) this century.
That conclusion did not get much exposure in the media.
Even Greece, despite its rapidly eroding competitiveness and increasingly unsustainable fiscal path, could attract the capital that it needed.
But austerity is not working; indeed, it is counterproductive.
Structural reforms are also necessary in most European economies to bolster competitiveness and boost potential growth.
But a shift toward policies to promote growth, supported by the easing of deficit targets and the issuance of Eurobonds, is essential to bring Europe back from the brink of sustained recession, to stabilize Europe’s financial markets, and to prevent another significant disruption to global capital markets.
Nothing.
The rationale has nothing to do with an ethical foreign policy or with German and European interests.
It looks as if Merkel’s government today has adopted the position of Germany’s Greens back then!
Unfortunately, you can forget about that.
The yen’s rising value raises the yield on Japanese bonds relative to the yield on bonds denominated in other currencies.
A direct effect of the higher interest rate would be to increase the budget deficit and the rate of growth of government debt.
The excess of saving over investment has given Japan a current-account surplus, allowing the country to finance all of the government borrowing domestically, with enough left over to invest in dollar-denominated bonds and other foreign securities.
Abe is right about one thing: Japan needs to get out of its no-growth and deflationary trap.
But time to search for loopholes is limited.
By contrast, refusing to comply with the ruling would likely inhibit BNY Mellon from executing the payments, making it virtually impossible to pay the warrant to exchange bondholders on time.
Unless Argentina puts forward an alternative payment proposal, the US Court of Appeals (and, possibly, the US Supreme Court) will have to choose between the holdouts’ “all” and Argentina’s “nothing.”
Britain and France could have stopped Germany.
Out of the ashes of war a new kind of Europe arose, as did a new kind of Japan, which even had a pacifist constitution (written by idealistic Americans, but gratefully accepted by most Japanese).
There is little doubt that the US, like all great powers, has embarked on foolish wars and acted like a bully, especially toward nations in its own hemisphere.
During the Cold War, this was not a serious dilemma.
The second will be expensive and risky.
Citizens associate the EU with, above all, bureaucratic grayness and technocratic rationality.
Electors chose only a representative for the House of Commons, and the majority party then appointed the prime minister.
Instead, politics was usually recast in terms of old inter-group or inter-ethnic tensions.
Each ideological grouping would most likely become factionalized along complex national lines – divisions likely to be reflected in the ensuing competition to be charismatic.
The Wrong Tax for Europe
A return to pre-2007 levels of macroeconomic and financial stability would support growth.
Worse still, over the long run, the tax burden would shift.
On the other hand, Latin America’s long-term growth record is hardly an advertisement for the approach, and accounting for lost tax revenues due to lower GDP would surely yield a less impressive fiscal outcome.
There is, in short, ample reason to be angry at financiers, and real change is needed in how they operate.
When poor countries consume as much per capita as rich countries, will there be enough oil to go around?
Two-thirds of proven reserves are in the Persian Gulf, one of the world’s most volatile regions.
Iran has threatened to cut oil exports if the United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against it for violating its nuclear pledges.
In the meantime, China’s mercantilist misunderstanding of markets means that it often overpays for what it mistakenly thinks is energy security.
The Olympic Games – no doubt perfectly organized, without a protester, homeless person, religious dissenter, or any other kind of spoilsport in sight – will probably bolster China’s global prestige.
Contrary to what some pundits say, Chinese capitalism is not like nineteenth-century European capitalism.
It may be a Faustian bargain – prosperity in exchange for political obedience – but so far it has worked.
No economy keeps growing at the same pace forever.
It might be a distant dream, but dreaming is what New Year’s is all about.
Brazil has stated that it intends to vote in the Security Council in favor of recommending Palestine’s admission to the General Assembly; Colombia has said that it plans to abstain.
And now, on the European and American attempt to impose UN-mandated sanctions on Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, the BRICS have gone from bad to worse.
With Ireland’s troubles threatening to spill over to Portugal, Spain, and even Italy, it is time to rethink the viability of Europe’s currency union.
State governments in turn have no legal power to abrogate debt contracts vis-à-vis out-of-state creditors, and no incentive to do so (given the help they get from the federal government).
It should have been expected that the political side of the equation would take time to fall into place.
It is hard to see how they can achieve both aims while remaining in the eurozone.
Countries can rejoin, and do so credibly, when the fiscal, regulatory, and political prerequisites are in place.
The Roman Catholic Church has not moved away from its opposition to IVF.
If that is the argument, however, why should we single out couples who use IVF? Why not, for example, criticize Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, the Arkansas couple who recently had their 18th child?
Some will find it grotesque to become a mother at an age when most women are grandmothers, but the more significant question is what kind of care such children will have if their parents die or become incapable of rearing them.
In doing so, officials are reluctant to take into account that the recent crisis resulted from an unprecedented credit boom gone bust.
But the US also has depressed areas.
On balance, it thus seems that this time – or, rather, this post-crisis environment – really is different, and that macroeconomic policies have done little to improve matters.
The protests began when the government tried to enact amnesty legislation that would have overturned the conviction of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra – Yingluck’s brother and the PTP’s founder, who was overthrown by the military in 2006 – on charges of corruption and abuse of power. (It also would have superseded the murder charges brought against the Democratic Party’s leader, former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.)
Making matters worse, voters on both sides are tuning in only to views with which they agree, rather than attempting to understand and reconcile opposing arguments.
Thailand’s experience suggests that efforts to subvert the system by thwarting the will of the majority may ultimately be fruitless, though not before imposing extremely high costs on everyone.
According to OECD estimates, the relative export performance of high-cost Germany increased by 10% from 2005 to 2013, while US exports grew only 1.2% faster than demand in the rest of the world.
And, even in these sectors, competitiveness must be defined in a much broader sense than that given simply by comparing cost statistics.
This is because greater reliance on recycling, for example, reduces costs – and thus enhances companies’ competitiveness – while reducing emissions and driving new approaches like cross-sector innovation.
BERLIN/BUDAPEST – In April, when German Chancellor Angel Merkel congratulated Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on his reelection, she let it be known that his large majority implied a “special responsibility” to use good judgment and behave with sensitivity toward opponents.
One might expect European conservatives, in particular, to react strongly to Orbán’s actions, which discredit their entire political movement.
These should include, first and foremost, the exclusion of Fidesz from the EPP faction in the European Parliament, to be readmitted only if and when Orbán changes course.
Fortunately, the EU and its members are far from powerless to prevent such an outcome.
This tendency at times of economic downturn suggests that SWFs are not the long-term, stable shareholders of foreign firms that they (and some commentators) claim themselves to be.
First, we have seen multiple examples of domestic investments by SWFs clearly aimed at sustaining and stabilizing domestic economies.
In times of crisis, SWFs not only invest a smaller proportion of their portfolios abroad and divest from some foreign holdings, but the total value of their investments tends to shrink as well.
At the same time, the expected benefits of having SWFs as shareholders – that is, of having a long, stable investor – might simply be a mirage, which disappears precisely when that stability is most needed: during a global financial crisis.
The outcome of two related policy battles will be key to the economic and political outlook in both the US and Europe.
But President Barack Obama and his congressional allies have rejected the consensus that government should be only a last resort for those in need, in favor of greater dependence, for both individuals and firms, on entitlement programs and other public spending, targeted tax breaks, regulations, and loans.
But those now demanding further deficit-financed stimulus must confront considerable evidence that an overhang of public debt impedes growth for a long time.
Canada, in the past two decades, has decreased spending by 8% of GDP and similarly prospered.
This is the rule set out by Walter Bagehot more than a century ago: calming the markets requires central banks to lend at a penalty rate to every distressed institution that would be able to put up reasonable collateral in normal times.
Of course, easy monetary policy can cause inflation, and the failure to “punish” financial institutions that exercised poor judgment in the past may lead to more of the same in the future.
Yes, the financial system is insolvent, but it has nominal liabilities and either it or its borrowers have some real assets.
CHICAGO – Democratic governments are not incentivized to take decisions that have short-term costs but produce long-term gains, the typical pattern for any investment.
Democracies are necessarily softhearted, whereas markets are not; government action has expanded to fill the gap.
For example, in the United States, public support for President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal was broad-based throughout the 1930’s.
Movements like the Tea Party have thus tended keep in check those who, after a crisis of the sort that America has had, typically want more government action, including curbing markets and competition.
Three Paths to America
The second Latin American position towards the US is embodied in “Chavism.” This stance characterizes populist governments, often sustained mainly by gas and oil, that practice autocratic democracy, ignoring any formal constitutional division of powers and running roughshod over independent institutions and the press.
But nothing guarantees that, even if the Democrats win, they will change America’s foreign policies.
Which Way for US Foreign Policy?
All of them were strong internationalists when compared to the true isolationists of the 1930s, who bitterly opposed coming to the aid of Britain in WWII.
The problem is not guns vs. butter, but guns vs. butter vs. taxes.
Is air power and the training of foreign forces enough? Particularly in the Middle East, where revolutions are likely to last for a generation, a smart combination of hard and soft power will be difficult to achieve.
How much to spend on foreign affairs and how to intervene in distant crises are important questions.
Just as important, however, was President Barack Obama’s reaction to the Colorado and Washington votes – both states that he won easily in his re-election bid.
The third change in recent months occurred in one of the world’s largest drug-supplying countries: Mexico, through which practically all of the illegal drugs shipped to the US – cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamines – must pass.
Uruguay is expected to approve legislation fully legalizing marijuana in January; the Organization of American States is scheduled to deliver a report to the region’s heads of state at mid-year on alternative drug-enforcement strategies and existing “best practices” in other countries.
Financial institutions with liquidity increasingly prefer to deposit their cash with the European Central Bank, which has had to resume its lending to banks.
Eurozone officials’ decision to reform the surveillance of governments and banks, and to boost the European Financial Stability Facility, is a welcome response, but, unfortunately, a partial one.
It has played this role with Italy and Spain, but it has met stiff opposition internally and may capitulate soon.
These responses are, of course, partly complementary.
Saving in China is in part a virtuous circle: rapid economic growth leads to high saving, which in turn sustains rapid growth.
However, the same factors seem to be working in the same direction for saving in the US, too.
For one thing, although the Chinese don’t elect their leaders, they trust their government more.
There is no shame in being poor in China if one reflects that one’s children or grandchildren will be wealthy and successful.
Today’s children will not view their own life stories from the perspective of the difficulties China has experienced.

दरअसल, पिछले 60 सालों में, तिब्बतियों ने प्रतिरोध के आंदोलन का ऐसा मॉडल अपनाया है, जिस पर आतंकवाद के साथ किन्हीं संबद्धताओं का दाग नहीं है। यहाँ तक कि तिब्बत की धार्मिक, सांस्कृतिक, और भाषायी विरासत के प्रति चीन का दमन अधिकाधिक कठोर होने पर भी, तिब्बतियों ने हथियार नहीं उठाए हैं। इसके बजाय, उन्होंने आत्मदाह के माध्यम से विरोध किया है, जो 2009 के बाद से 140 तिब्बतियों ने किया है।
Chua’s thesis is that, when compared to Americans, Chinese children tend to be successful because they have “tiger mothers,” whereas Western mothers are pussycats, or worse.
No matter how hard a tiger mom pushes, not every student can finish first (unless, of course, we make everyone “top of the class”).
Another couple believes in “self-directed learning” to such an extent that one evening they went to bed at 11 p.m., leaving their five-year-old watching her ninth straight hour of Barbie videos.
Tigers lead solitary lives, except for mothers with their cubs.
We are entering a post-American world – the world beyond America’s brief moment of global domination.
The late twentieth century worked so well for Europeans.
So, for most European states, transatlantic relations are primarily about NATO and their bilateral links with the US.
There is no shortage of ideas about how to encourage this through new processes and forums for US-EU strategic dialogue.
Time for America to Turn South
First and foremost is economic growth, which for the past few years - indeed, for the past two decades - has been dismal.
Second, America has a strong security interest in the region.
Last year, I visited the main jumping-off point on the US-Mexican border: El Sasabe on the Sonora-Arizona border.
China is being pressured to halt its interventions to prop up the US dollar in world currency markets, with opponents emphasizing how much harm the policy is causing to other countries.
There is a great deal of volatility in foreign-exchange markets across the globe, mainly owing to the weakening of the dollar.
If exchange rates were fixed but capital could move freely, capital flight from the country would generate pressures to end loose monetary policies.
LONDON – As US and NATO soldiers prepare for their tenth Christmas in Afghanistan, a new buzzword is making the rounds: “transition,” the process of transferring responsibility for security from international to Afghan forces ahead of the withdrawal of foreign troops, which is set to begin in the spring of 2011.
Lack of transparency is driving fears that Hamid Karzai’s government is brokering a power-sharing deal with the Taliban that will do little to foster stability or better governance.
For this reason, perpetrators of serious human-rights violations on all sides should be held accountable, a demand that has been pointedly ignored since 2001.
Fire, bullets, and bayonets were now joined by nuclear radiation – a silent, invisible killer like gas and biological agents.
The aim of the NPT, signed in 1968, is the universal elimination of nuclear weapons: non-nuclear-weapon states commit not to acquire them, and the five states that officially possess them (the US, the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia) commit to disarmament negotiations.
Doing so, it was suggested, could lead Russia to remove its own tactical nuclear weapons.
For that reason alone, it should become an international priority.
The Americans are happy that India’s pesky left, reduced to a paltry 24 seats, has been all but eliminated from national government.
That’s exciting news to retailers looking for new markets.
Observers expect the young Gandhi to become prime minister within two years.
His philosophy of non-violence was aimed at the most basic form of human aggression: the appetite for more than one’s share.
“[I]f the US were getting good value from the extra…$750 billion diverted annually from paying people who make directly useful goods and provide directly useful services, it would be obvious in the statistics.”
It seemed to me that, yes, our modern sophisticated financial systems had created enormous macroeconomic risks.
That rather poor cost-benefit ratio does not appear to be improving.
And it carries its own serious risks of moral hazard and the loss of the ECB’s credibility and independence.
In response to this trend, the IMF urges a return to pre-crisis debt-to-GDP ratios.
Will a new Stability and Growth Pact, with eurozone members assessing the fiscal policies of their peers, solve these problems? IMF consultations and evaluations have had little impact outside of economies that are heavily dependent on IMF programs.
Sensible rules promise big payoffs, given the current and long-term global crisis in public finances.
In services, trade barriers stand in the way of improved quality and efficiency, slowing the growth of a sector that could make a huge contribution to competitiveness and employment.
If properly designed, they can benefit their members, especially if combined with reduced trade barriers for all trading partners.
For example, it is untenable in rich countries that farm interests accounting for less than 4% of employment are effectively able to block a deal to open new markets for services and manufactures, which account for more than 90% of employment.
For the sake of their citizens, the global trading system, and the world’s poor, it is time to get back to business.
So, the US banking system is effectively insolvent in the aggregate; most of the British banking system looks insolvent, too, as do many continental European banks.
Indeed, the problem has now grown larger, because the current approach has led weak banks to take over even weaker banks.
The US remains the world’s most powerful state, however, and the senators’ decision will inevitably have an impact beyond their country’s borders.
The cataclysmic potential of such a conflict makes it essential to limit and eventually eliminate this leftover from the Cold War.
Any delay to the treaty, however, will embolden those in Moscow who would rather have the West as an enemy than as a partner – and who thus would like to see the tenuous progress made in recent months to be undone.
For Europeans, the NIE has not removed, but rather confirmed, the concerns that in 2003 prompted the EU-3 (Britain, France, and Germany) – namely, that Iran’s nuclear program could eventually give it a military nuclear capability, and that even before that point, it might trigger regional nuclear proliferation.
Politically, Ahmadinejad certainly would not miss the chance to exploit unilateral measures for propaganda purposes – claiming that Iran has a conflict not with the international community, but with imperialist states intent on depriving his country of technological progress.
Both the EU and the US should be prepared to enter into direct, comprehensive, and unconditional negotiations with Iran. Where security guarantees are concerned, America is Iran’s actual foe and potential partner.
And, so far, we have neither.
The financial sector’s inexcusable recklessness, given free rein by mindless deregulation, was the obvious precipitating factor of the crisis.
Rapid productivity increases in manufacturing had outpaced growth in demand, which meant that manufacturing employment decreased.
Countries recognized that without reserves, they risked losing their economic sovereignty.
And government-financed education and training, in particular, will be critical in restoring competitiveness in Europe and the US.
Indeed, the number of research questions that we can pose is increasing exponentially.
In a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association published in July 2005, I showed that refutation is very common, even for the most prestigious research findings.
Sometimes, this will be the best evidence we have.
But it would be a damaging to expect science to “show off” in this way.
Greece will need to reduce its debt ratio considerably before it can return to the capital markets, which implies – even under an optimistic scenario – creating a primary surplus in excess of eight percentage points of GDP.
Debt reduction is not fatal.
Europe, however, is not obliged to choose between catastrophe and mutualization of debt.
They did agree – barely ­– to hold a low-level experts meeting in early July, but no one expects this to lead to a breakthrough.
There are several sub-texts underlying the current stand-off, superbly analyzed in a report this month from the International Crisis Group.
But those assessments will prove to be naïve unless Iran, at the very least, verifiably suspends any enrichment beyond 5%, renders its 20% stockpile incapable of military application, and meets the concern about Fordow by modifying its role and opening it to intrusive monitoring.
Tobacco use has the potential to undermine economic and social development worldwide.
The report also details the efforts countries are making to meet tobacco-control targets and makes recommendations for improvement.
The tobacco industry and other vested interests argue that tax increases on tobacco products fuel illicit trade.
CAMBRIDGE – European leaders are seriously considering a Tobin tax, which would put a small levy on financial transactions, thereby dampening trading.
While these are worthy goals, there are good reasons to believe that the tax would not achieve most of them.
That left the financial institutions that held mortgage-backed securities in much weaker condition, and several failed.
To be sure, markets might move those transactions from France and from French financial institutions, and, if the regulators erred – because the business was profitable and not destabilizing – French institutions would lose out.
Until recently, the government’s response to the epidemic, which threatened the country’s very lifeblood, was lackluster and foolish.
But, during the 1990’s, and for reasons that are still not fully understood, the virus exploded into the general population.
With almost two million patients now on antiretroviral treatment, annual AIDS-related deaths have fallen by around 100,000 since 2005.
It seems appropriate that, due to the Iraq war, the world has been debating the nature of democracy 200 years after Alexis de Tocqueville’s birth.
Neither local democracy nor small societies, neither governmental checks and balances nor civil rights, can prevent the decline of critical thought that democracy seems to cause.
Do the defects of democracy really mean, as Tocqueville claimed, that resigned pessimism is the only – realistic but unsustainable – path open to us? I don’t think so.
The result of the failure is a generalized indifference and passivity in audiences.
Since the 1960’s, such proscriptions have weakened until, in the end, explicit sexuality, violence, blasphemy – while upsetting to some people – were tolerated as a part of the enlightened world.
One such limit is the incitement to violence.
This means that we have to defend Salman Rushdie and the Danish cartoonists and the friends of Idomeneo , whether we like them or not.
Whether an editor publishes cartoons offensive to believers in Muhammad (or Christ, for that matter) is a matter of judgment, almost of taste.
That ideology is based on a warped and false view of religion.
When I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1997, Nigeria served as an example of productive cooperation between Christians and Muslims.
The Middle East, as we know, is immersed in a process of revolution and upheaval that has been immensely complicated by Islamism and its extremist offshoots.
This Islamist ideology is a spectrum.
So the battle is not lost.
LONDON – In November, I spoke at the United Nations Security Council for the first time in 13 years.
It is a threat that is constantly evolving, growing, and mutating to counter our fight against it.
That is why we need to start thinking of education as a security issue.
There are extremist acts perpetrated against Muslims because of their religion, and today there are fanatical Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Buddhists who disfigure the true nature of their faith.
To be sure, we are only a drop in the ocean.
It is up to all of us to show people that we have a better idea than the extremists have – to learn from each other and live with each other.
Britain’s most adept and skillful politician has evidently known for years exactly what not to do about arranging his departure, and yet he has chosen to ignore his own advice.
So there was the topic, inescapably, right in the middle of the room.
Now, with the country insisting on an answer to the question he posed, they see him as a liability.
They may also suggest a slight tendency, on the part of those uttering them, to believe in some kind of supernatural endorsement.
Throughout the long years of this bloody tragedy, we have tried to inch our way to a settlement through confidence-building measures or, in the case of the long dead “Road Map,” through pushing both parties to take parallel steps towards an agreement.
There cannot be a Palestinian state without dealing with West Bank settlements.
That historic triumph depended on bringing in Sinn Fein politicians – leaders of the Irish Republican movement who in many cases could not be distinguished from the IRA, which bombed, shot, and maimed civilians in pursuit of its political goals.
I want to see – and I’m sure Blair does, too – a peaceful Palestinian state next door to a secure Israel in a region united in prosperity and stability.
Yet Blair’s domestic legacy is a mood of disillusion and mistrust, especially of Blair himself.
So why did Blair support it? Part of the answer goes back to Blair’s first big foreign policy adventure, NATO’s intervention in Kosovo in 1999.
Indeed, it is possible that Blair, through his complicity in the Iraq war, has inflicted major damage on the very idea of a “special relationship” between Britain and the United States.
The term “too big to fail” dates back several decades, but it entered wide usage in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
Regulators are instructed, in no uncertain terms, to make sure that all large financial firms are structured in such a way that bankruptcy, using the standard rules and procedures of the court system, can happen without repeating the catastrophic post-Lehman cascade.
Second, it is fanciful to believe that the private sector would want to get involved in providing funding to a huge financial firm under court supervision, particularly during a systemic crisis.
Too Big to Reform?
That is easy to say, but governments, individually and collectively, are still struggling to redefine the terms of that contract.
The British government did the same, acting as midwife to the Lloyds-Halifax Bank of Scotland combine, now widely seen to have been a major error.
It is encouraging, too, that private equity funds look interested in creating and funding new entrants.
Numerous policy options to deal with this problem are now being debated.
And it is possible – indeed, I suspect likely – that such credit-supply problems would exist even if the too-big-to-fail problem were effectively addressed.
To remedy this, we need two kinds of transitions.
Government savings have fallen, especially in the United States and Japan, and household savings have virtually disappeared in some countries with housing booms.
But if the problem is weak investment, then a reduction in such incentives will lead to excessively high real interest rates when the factors holding back investment dissipate.
But the answer is not a low-quality investment binge led by government or fuelled by easy credit; we know the consequences of that.
In that possibility lies the well-being of us all.
Nevertheless, he is telling the truth.
The scandal over Mayor Luzhkov’s incompetence in handling this summer’s deadly heat wave and wild fires is being portrayed as a split between the “modernizing” Medvedev and the “old guard” Putin.
Since Putin did not formally take sides over what would happen to Luzhkov, had Medvedev’s campaign against Moscow’s former mayor failed, the president would have found himself without a job in 2012.
Beyond the opposition, numerous non-political public initiatives have sprung up in the last several years to protest specific government policies – leading inevitably to confrontation with the existing political order.
The answer is most likely both and neither.
Beyond this, we were taught that we could "apply pressure."
The hidden rules of the game came closest to being officially acknowledged during two uninterrupted weeks of simulated interrogations towards the end of the training course.
We never studied them, nor were we given a copy to read, much less tested on their contents.
Now that Europe’s current crisis has convinced many that existing institutional arrangements are unsustainable, this may be about to change.
But the euro is no longer a strong common currency that reinforces a shared European identity.
Although the Stability and Growth Pact has lost more and more respect (indeed, it is now to be applied, according to the European Commission, purely according to national leaders’ discretion), it would remain the anchor for fiscal stability and confidence.
Attempting to compel transfer payments would generate moral hazard on the part of the recipients and resistance from the donors, with the resulting increase in tensions possibly jeopardizing the integration that has been achieved so far.
It is difficult to see the stationing of 2,500 US Marines in Darwin, Australia – a decision announced by US President Barack Obama on his recent tour of Asia – as anything more than a symbolic gesture, a provocative reminder that the US is determined to stay in the region.
Under current conditions, responding to China’s rise with military force would be unwelcome.
An alliance between the US, Japan, Australia, and possibly India designed to contain China would be greeted by the Chinese with that history firmly in mind.
Of course, diplomacy needs to be backed by strength, but the US has plenty without militarizing the Asia-Pacific region more than it already has.
Asia today presents a completely new and unique set of circumstances.
De Gaulle’s constitution has also proved flexible enough to allow France to overcome several crises – Algeria, May 1968, de Gaulle’s resignation, changes of government from right to left, and antagonism between left-wing presidents and right-wing prime ministers or vice-versa (“la cohabitation”), as occurred in 1986, 1993, and 1997.
Others support moving toward a pure parliamentary regime in the manner of the United Kingdom.
To strengthen this new institutional balance, Sarkozy is considering providing the opposition with a formal status, thus turning it into a real alternative power, and he wants to review the constitution’s Article 16, which gives excessive power to the president in times of crisis.
It needs to become a political initiative.
Foreign ministries translated that idea into the Stability Pact, but finance ministers refused to finance it, so the pact remained an empty shell.
The European Commission is already engaged in preparing such plans. They need to be given greater substance.
They do on a small scale what the Wider European Initiative ought to do on a large scale: promote democratic development by supporting civil society while working with governments when possible.
Belarus seems beyond redemption, but appearances are deceptive.
By the decade’s end, China’s economy will be larger than Germany’s.
This gives us considerable standing.
Environmental degradation in Asia not only harms its population’s health, but will become an impediment to growth.
ASEAN is working with its partners to tackle global issues such as security, energy, and climate change, and its plans for a charter on enhanced cooperation is an encouraging first step toward creating a political architecture.
Europe must take Asian views on global governance seriously.
In this progressive transformation of the international system, German and European foreign policy will play an active role.
But, if the results of such tests are to be reliable, they should avoid the US tests’ fundamental flaw.
Rather than estimate the economic value of banks’ assets – what the assets would fetch in a well-functioning market – and the extent to which they exceed liabilities, the stress tests merely sought to verify that the banks’ accounting losses over the next two years will not exhaust their capital as recorded in their books.
Either way, the true value of banks’ toxic assets must be estimated before concluding that banks are armed with sufficient capital to carry out their critical roles.
Yet pressure to democratize is mounting, in part due to the smaller Gulf States, which compete with each other in democratic reforms.
Low turnout, by contrast, could convince western audiences that, despite the Saudi state’s best efforts to jump-start democracy, its people are satisfied with the status quo.
Indeed, the “King Abdul-Aziz Center for National Dialogue” is utterly divorced from domestic realities and serves as a mere propaganda center whose participants believe that they form part of the state’s message to the outside world.
Despite cynicism, apathy, frustration, despair, and violence, some Saudis still hope for the emergence of a prince on a white horse who will place the kingdom onto the path of reform.
But the politics of trade liberalization – that is, the way in which countries proceed to accept free trade – is much more complex, largely because of those particular groups it hurts.
After all, existing tariff levels on manufactured goods are already much lower than those on agriculture or dairy products.
As the economist Jagdish Bhagwati points out, maintaining increased protections for, say, intellectual property may encourage research and innovation.
Failure to ratify the TPP in all 12 countries would be a major disappointment, not just because of the tremendous amount of effort that has gone into it, but also – and more important – because of the vast economic benefits it would bring to all countries involved.
And then it became a convoy, as Malaysia, Mexico, Canada, and finally – in 2013 – Japan joined the negotiations.
South Korea is warming to the idea of the TPP, as is Indonesia, following President Joko Widodo’s recent visit to Washington, DC.
Japan’s ranchers do need time to adjust.
So why not protect our landscape as a resource for tourism – and even as a way of combating climate change?
But at this stage, the TPP is different: the odds of success would be much greater if the US attached the additional requirement that participating countries do not engage in currency manipulation.
Similarly, the US Treasury is legally required to determine if a country is intervening to an unfair and unreasonable extent.
Participating countries could allow their currencies to float, or they could operate a fixed exchange rate.
The fast-track measure, officially known as Trade Promotion Authority, passed only because Obama was able to rely on rare backing from the Republican majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
In 2007, by contrast, 109 House Democrats voted in favor of the US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, precisely because its terms had been adjusted as requested and in line with the May agreement.
And the May 2007 agreement makes it clear that “foreign investors in the US will not be accorded greater substantive rights with respect to investment protections than US investors in the US.”
Yes, the logic of market-based global commerce is very strong.
Regrettably, the United States is insisting on a series of intellectual-property provisions that serve the interests of US-based firms, but do little to create a sound environment for innovation elsewhere.
A firm in Thailand, the Philippines, or Vietnam can develop a new product line by plugging into the huge East Asian value chain and producing, for example, a tiny component which, along with myriad other components, will be assembled into a smartphone at a factory in China.
The US is pushing for longer copyright protection for published works, music, and films.
But most economists agree that such incentives must be balanced against the need to accelerate knowledge dissemination and absorption, and that the optimum is somewhere in the middle.
The US itself would benefit from having trade partners that can innovate, instead of serving only as passive buyers for American movies and songs.
Additional gains from trade include increased variety and the economies of scale implied by producing for global markets.
Through a succession of lengthy and difficult global negotiations – the so-called “GATT rounds” – tariffs were steadily lowered for an increasing variety of goods.
This can occur in a number of ways, such as the erection of non-tariff barriers that favor domestic incumbents at the expense of lower-priced potential imports that would benefit consumers.
WASHINGTON, DC – It is impossible to deny that trade and exchange rates are closely linked.
The most direct method is purchases of foreign assets.
Meanwhile, most other eurozone countries have lately been forced to tighten fiscal policy, thereby reducing or eliminating their current-account deficits.
The G-20 “mutual assessment process” – established to analyze national economic policies’ effects on other countries and on global growth, with the goal of formulating individual adjustment commitments – has highlighted the difficulty of reaching agreement on macroeconomic policies with significant spillover effects.
But aid is no panacea.
Trade is also an engine of political and economic reform.
What is needed, therefore, is a pledge by governments to make global trade liberalization a much higher political priority.
CAMBRIDGE – US President Barack Obama is still pressing to obtain Trade Promotion Authority and use it to conclude negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union. But many in the US Congress insist that provisions must be added to the agreements to prevent currency manipulation.
The People’s Bank of China, for example, bought a record quantity of dollars from 2004 to 2014, thereby preventing the renminbi’s exchange rate from appreciating as fast as it otherwise would have done.
Some have argued that even though the PBOC has stopped buying US and other foreign assets, China’s sovereign wealth funds still do, and that this, too, counts as manipulation.
NEW YORK – The massacre in Norway in July 2011 and the recent attack on a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, were the work of right-wing extremists who sought to remake the world in their neo-Nazi image.
Many in the US feared that, just as the nineteenth century had been British and the twentieth century had been American, the twenty-first century would be Japanese.
Similarly, Senator Charles Schumer of New York has indulged in Japan-bashing, China-bashing, and India-bashing – a singular record of truculence and economic illiteracy – while Senator Barbara Boxer of California attacked her most recent electoral opponent, Carly Fiorina, for eliminating 30,000 jobs at Hewlett Packard during her stewardship of the company.
Unfortunately, it has gotten a much lower standard than it anticipated.
The irony is that trade has collapsed just when these countries were becoming increasingly active in global markets, with their exports rising by more than 20% during this decade.
Trade increases competition and keeps inflation in check.
Despite the economic crisis, Aid for Trade donor contributions to help the less fortunate have risen 10% per year since 2005, and major donors are on track to meet or exceed their pledges for future funds.
The next Ministerial Conference ought to signal that we are ready to do so.
Our second message was optimistic: if the agenda of the current round is reoriented towards development, and if assistance is provided to manage implementation and adjustment costs, developing countries can gain much.
These were off the agenda in earlier trade rounds, as the US pushed for liberalization of financial services - thus serving its own comparative advantage.
Are developing countries really targeting this area in the next few years? Clearly, this issue is not high on their agenda.
The breakdown of the Cancun talks may yet provide an opportunity for deeper reflection.
She has written a manifesto about breaking the glass ceiling, called Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, and is drawing fire for it, because she argues that women often sabotage themselves.
So the opportunity to learn and practice speaking and negotiating skills is hardly inconsequential for women’s advancement.
The all-female peer group’s emphasis on supporting women to be strong and achieve their goals is critical, as two young leaders, Courtney Martin and Katie Orenstein (both Woodhull Institute alumnae) recently noted.
NEW YORK – As negotiators and ministers from the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries meet in Atlanta in an effort to finalize the details of the sweeping new Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), some sober analysis is warranted.
For starters, consider what the agreement would do to expand intellectual property rights for big pharmaceutical companies, as we learned from leaked versions of the negotiating text.
International corporate interests tout ISDS as necessary to protect property rights where the rule of law and credible courts are lacking.
Rather than shutting down manufacturers and forcing them to compensate those who had been harmed, under ISDS, governments would have had to pay the manufacturers not to kill their citizens.
(Members of Congress may read the technical text, under restricted conditions, but are not allowed to describe its contents in detail.)
Encouraging exports to these countries is surely desirable, but the economic impact on the US is unlikely to be more than a rounding error.
In Vietnam, moving large subsidies provided to state-owned enterprises onto a measurable, market basis would be a sensible goal.
As Levin recently argued in a detailed and persuasive speech, the US should be having a full and open debate about these dimensions of the TPP deal.
The drift in transatlantic relations during the eight years of George W. Bush’s presidency was meant to be stopped – and even reversed.
America fears deflation; Europe – driven by its largest economy, Germany – fears national debt and inflation.
Brown has few options left, and the UK is nowhere near the worst of the crisis.
This kind of legitimate and yet petty-minded thinking has serious international consequences.
If Europe sees its role in this crisis – which might yet turn into a full-blown depression – as that of a free-rider, it will be treated accordingly in the future.
Such actions undermine the slow renovation of transatlantic trust since Edward Snowden’s revelations concerning the extent of American surveillance of European governments and citizens alike.
Fortunately, solutions that satisfy the need for national security and demands for privacy are not out of reach.
That is why building transatlantic trust and cooperation is so important, and why America’s refusal to turn words into legal guarantees is likely to be self-defeating.
The Growth and Stability Pact would safeguard fiscal discipline.
But the International Monetary Fund and the United States rejected the idea.
The depreciation that followed the crisis helped accelerate recovery by boosting exports.
Europeans now have a regional monetary fund, which Asians wanted but could not have.
Although science has demonstrated that CO2 from fossil fuels is heating the planet, politicians are unwilling to follow his advice and stop building coal-fired power plants.
There is clearly a trend.
CO2 emissions result from other, generally beneficial acts, such as burning coal to keep warm, burning kerosene to cook, or burning gas to transport people.
Is it really treason against the planet to express some skepticism about whether this is the right way forward?
Earlier that day, the prince had the bomber flown in on his private jet from the Yemeni-Saudi border and reportedly ordered that he not be carefully searched.
For example, he offers significant financial inducements to individual jihadis, as well as their families, in return for political obedience.
Suicide bombings of public buildings and attacks on oil and other government installations have alienated many Saudis.
The annual World Economic Forum is rightly perceived as a global “barometer.”
Of course, the danger of Davos lies in this concentrated commingling of the chattering classes and the real world of politics and business.
The return of the state, even when it is the power of the European Commission to sanction Microsoft, is on everyone’s lips.
Traditional growth theories focus on systematic forces – for example, capital accumulation, employment, and technical change – that, by definition, operate all the time, although with varying degrees of intensity.
First, because financial crises as deep as the latest one are socially so costly, it is only natural to try to prevent them.
There are no policies that could suspend the operation of all these linkages without damaging longer-term growth.
Given the fiscal legacy of the current crisis, no efforts should be spared in anchoring fiscal discipline firmly in European Union countries.
ISLAMABAD – Sitting next to a four-foot-tall water pipe, I asked the tribal leader in front of me: What does victory mean to you? He sputtered smoke, raised his bushy white eyebrows, and said, “Victory.
America sends in missiles and air strikes that infuriate the people rather than aid and emissaries to engage them.
With five years of Iraqi experience – and powerful communication and financial support behind them – this network is growing rapidly.
And the international community is absent as well.
SRSP has the capacity; they just need direction and financial support in order to expand.
“Libertarian paternalists” like Sunstein and Thaler claim that we have two different ways of making decisions: one “from the gut” (called System I), and the other more deliberative and far more effective (called System II).
With a neat twist of logic, our cognitive imperfections are turned on their heads, and made to work to achieve System-II choices.
The benefits of tax evasion may far outweigh the risk of getting caught, but imagine if everyone decided to evade taxes at the same time.
The Enlightenment idea that our System-II rationality can always point to an optimal choice about which every reasonable individual would agree clashes with the widely accepted modern idea that there is a plurality of reasonable choices.
Japan’s new activism also was widely imitated. South Korea and then Brazil started similar action to drive down their currency.
But the report gave no guidance about how to judge whether exchange rates were appropriate or not.
As debate about Japanese economic decline intensified, a consensus emerged in Japan that outside pressure had forced the country into adopting a dangerous and ultimately destructive course.
The debate about China’s artificially pegged exchange rate has led Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to begin to believe that they, too, might try shaping exchange rates.
Harper’s tough talk on Russia’s annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine, and on China’s disturbing human-rights record won him wide public support.
And closer integration with Canada’s vast energy resources could provide Europe with an attractive alternative to its heavy reliance on imports from Russia and the Middle East.
Trudeau, by contrast, has vowed to be a very different type of leader, promising to pursue an inclusive approach to policymaking and to allow his ministers to take much greater responsibility for their portfolios.
And yet now we must ask whether the US current-account deficit is still a problem.
I propose a third, more speculative reason why it may be time to stop worrying about the US current-account deficit.
Everyone knows that errors and omissions are large, especially when it comes to financial transactions.
But part of the discrepancy also reflects the discovery of missing assets, some of which may have originated in the reinvestment of overseas income.
Admittedly, the country’s dire economic condition and its urgent need for energy made the agreement venal in a way.
Success would be guaranteed if the international community, especially the United States, clearly understands and admits its necessity, and supports it firmly and completely.
Nor has the Iranian government ever publicly expressed a will to possess nuclear weapons.
If we interpret the NPT correctly, we can launch negotiations with Iran that would carefully explore the potential sincerity or not of its official stance.
But Tsipras squandered Greece’s opportunity, because he and other Syriza leaders were unable to see beyond the horizon of their party’s origins in radical opposition activism.
I hope that they do not share policy priorities, particularly a change of strategic alliances, which would be equally bad for Greece and for Europe.
The Greek crisis cannot be used either to weaken European conservatives and change the balance of power within the EU, or to remove the Greek left from office.
Penurunan jumlah pemilih yang anjlok dalam waktu kurang dari dua bulan menggambarkan perubahan suasana hati pemilih secara drastis – dari penuh semangat menjadi murung.
Mulai tahun depan, setiap pengusaha diharuskan membayar 26% turnover tax dari setiap euro yang dihasilkan – sembari diwajibkan membayar pajak di muka pada tahun 2016 nanti yang besarnya adalah 75% dari jumlah pajak mereka tahun 2017.
Sayangnya, meskipun potong rambut ini diperlukan, sekarang sudah terlambat, hanya sedikit, dan terlalu berbahaya sehubungan dengan parameter keuangan dan hukum mereka.
Gagasan ini bertujuan untuk menunjukkan kepada pemilih bahwa pemerintah dapat menggabungkan kapitulasi pada troika dengan agenda reformasinya sendiri, terdiri atas peningkatan efisiensi dan serangan terhadap oligarki yang dapat membebaskan dana dengan tujuan mengurangi dampak austerity terhadap Yunani yang melemah.
That needs to change – especially as we learn more about the interaction between TB and another deadly global killer: diabetes.
Two decades ago, TB and HIV/AIDS were paired in a similar deadly interplay.
That event, hosted by the Indonesian Ministry of Health, drew experts from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.
In other words, the diseases that cause nine-tenths of what the World Health Organization refers to as “the global burden of disease” are getting only one-tenth of the world’s medical research effort.
At a meeting in Oslo in August, Incentives for Global Health, a nonprofit organization directed by Aidan Hollis, professor of economics at the University of Calgary, and Thomas Pogge, professor of philosophy and international affairs at Yale, launched a radical new proposal to change the incentives under which corporations are rewarded for developing new medicines.  They suggest that governments contribute to a Health Impact Fund that would pay pharmaceutical companies in proportion to the extent to which their products reduce the global burden of disease.
Hollis and Pogge estimate that about $6 billion a year would be required to enable the Fund to provide a sufficient incentive for drug companies to register products that target the diseases of the poor.
Given concerns about security and the fate of the democratic transition, economic issues were essentially put on hold in both elections. Now it is time for Tunisia’s leaders to put the economy at the top of their agenda.
There is already broad agreement among the major political parties on the necessary priorities: bringing public spending under control, encouraging private-sector growth and employment, promoting regional development and social inclusion, and investing in essential infrastructure.
The incoming funds, and the subsequent growth and job creation, would undergird the consolidation of democracy – and thus help cement the impressive gains that Tunisia has made so far.
They later found themselves on the losing end of a long history of violence between their own separatist forces and the Turkish army, as well as being subjected to an ongoing policy of discrimination and forced assimilation.
There are also understandable fears that diverging from the official line would trigger a flood of compensation claims, as occurred against Germany.
This is not healthy for the development of Armenia’s democracy and weak economy.
Turkey’s bureaucrats, politicians, and citizens united to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership and tolerated the pain of the IMF-directed structural-adjustment programs.
They consider a European Turkey an opportunity to develop their own relations with the EU.
Turkey’s constructive engagement with the EU creates a sense of trust in the West – among Western leaders at least, if not yet the general population -- for its regional initiatives.
At the start of the new decade, too, Turkey’s geopolitical position, rich historical heritage, cultural depth, well-educated young population, ever-strengthening democracy, growing economy, and constructive foreign policy make it an indispensable country in a world transformed by rapid globalization.
There are few countries that can play such a critical role.
History clearly shows that it is impossible to establish and sustain global peace without ensuring peace and stability in the Balkans and the Middle East.
Therefore, we urge Israel and all other countries involved to follow constructive and peaceful policies.
Turkey’s ever-increasing soft power is becoming one of its most significant traits, which we will continue to use to enhance regional and global peace.
Committed to regime change in Syria, Turkey turned a blind eye to some of these groups’ brutal tactics, radical ideologies, and big ambitions.
To this end, the US and its allies should consider striking Assad’s strongholds in Syria, while establishing safe havens for the moderate opposition under the protective cloak of a no-fly zone.
This means, first and foremost, adopting a zero-tolerance policy toward the Islamic State at home, aimed at preventing the group from fundraising and recruiting on Turkish soil.
In any serious variation of this Grand Strategy, Turkey will need to play a central role – politically, militarily, economically, and culturally.
The key dispute is over Cyprus.
But this attitude is irresponsible.
The final result of the accession process is therefore an open question for both sides.
Indeed, the Arab Spring strengthens rather than weakens Turkey’s position in the Arab world, and vindicates the new strategic thrust of Turkish foreign policy.
Arab intellectuals, activists, and youth leaders of different political inclinations have taken a keen interest in what some describe as the “Turkish model.”
Simply put, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the Nahda Movement in Tunisia, and Hamas in Palestine will all play important and legitimate roles in the political future of their respective countries.
Yesterday, there were flurries of snow in Istanbul. But today the sun glints across the water to the Asian coastline of the city; the seagulls bank in the breeze; a great liner sails majestically north towards the Black Sea.
And we dragged others into our struggles.
It worked far better than the doubters ever imagined was possible – indeed, perhaps even better than its progenitors expected.
Europe with Turkey as a member would naturally be a more dynamic economy.
TEL AVIV – As the Islamic State militant group has advanced across Iraq and Syria, traditional regional alliances, long shaped by Western powers, have been upended.
A couple of weeks later, Erdoğan himself unleashed a furious anti-Western diatribe at Istanbul’s Marmara University. In his speech,&nbsp;he compared the West’s interference in the Middle East today with the British officer Lawrence of Arabia’s involvement in the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans during World War I, and blasted the&nbsp;Sykes-Picot Agreement, which has since defined the Middle East’s political map.
Together, these groups have emerged as the most effective force in the war against the Islamic State.
Erdoğan now finds himself in a strategic quagmire.
The defendants had been given long prison sentences after the first trial concluded in September 2012, even though the evidence against them was clearly forged.
The Gülen movement – made up of the followers of the Pennsylvania-based Turkish imam Fethullah Gülen – did the heavy political lifting. The Gülen movement oversaw Sledgehammer and similar trials via its followers in the police and the judiciary, and used its extensive media outlets to craft and disseminate the narrative – built from countless stories of military plots and other malfeasance – on which these cases rested.
The Erdoğan government adopted legislation that lent credence to its false narrative.
Under intense attack by pro-government media, the general staff failed to mount even the slightest public effort on the accused officers’ behalf, even refusing to release an internal report that left no doubt that the defendants had been framed.
The Case for Turkey in Europe
Turkey has also been diligent in its efforts to consolidate its democracy through the expansion of civil rights and liberties.
Instead, they are facing a variety of criminal charges, including murder with a firearm, bank robbery, and the bombing of police stations.
In a region of predominantly Muslim countries, Turkey has proved itself to be the only one that can maintain and strengthen genuine democracy.
MADRID ‒ June’s Turkish general election sent a powerful message: Turkey’s democracy remains intact.
The direction of change will have to account for the various parties’ preferred approaches.
The escalation of warfare and sectarian violence, which are becoming chronic, endanger both Turkey and Europe.
European leaders should also carefully monitor the possible revision of Turkish foreign policy, grasping opportunities to reignite bilateral dialogue on issues of common interest.
Shortly after that decision, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reversed her previous opposition to Turkish membership in the EU, calling it an “open-ended issue” during a visit to Istanbul.
With the world now more determined than ever to defeat the Islamic State – an enterprise that will, it is becoming clear, require boots on the ground – the major powers are seeking immediately available forces.
Neither side can afford further complication of the already volatile situation.
In the wake of Turkey’s fraying relations with Russia, the decision to proceed with the planned EU-Turkey Summit is an important one.
The massacre of civilians (including many children) in Gaza last summer, the barbarity of ISIS, the murder of rabbis at a Jerusalem synagogue, and the terrorist attack in Ottawa last October – all convey a simple truth: violence is contagious.
The establishment of a more inclusive Iraqi government – enabled by the common sense and coordinated efforts of actors within and outside of the country – is also a positive sign, as are steps toward resolving disagreements between the Kurdistan Regional Government and the central authorities in Baghdad.
It is in everybody’s interest that Israel’s government acts with restraint regarding West Bank settlement and the status of Jerusalem and its holy sites.
The alternative may be too grim for even a pessimist to imagine.
Still, Turkey is in negotiations with a Franco-Japanese consortium for the construction of a second nuclear power plant on the Black Sea.
Indeed, the US has based nuclear weapons in Turkey for decades.
In these circumstances, it matters how the rest of the world portrays and talks about Turkey’s nuclear future.
But this did not happen as Atatürk planned.
Indeed, even Erdoğan, evidently trying to stop the MHP’s advance, used campaign rhetoric that alienated many Kurdish voters.
The third peace process in play concerns Turkey’s relationship with Armenia, which, if improved, could help create the conditions for a peace settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
So Turkey’s new administration should be ready to engage in a constructive dialogue, together with the United States and Iran, on possible solutions.
Many American policymakers and publicists, unable or unwilling to distinguish Turkish-Israeli relations from Turkish-American relations, interpreted Erdoğan’s condemnation of Israel’s blockade of Gaza as a bid to cozy up to his Arab neighbors at the expense of Turkey’s relations with not only Israel but with the West in general.
First, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) could not afford to be seen as opposing democracy in Syria, given that its own legitimacy rests heavily on its democratic credentials.
Finally, Turkey has invested far too much in its strategic relations with NATO, and with the US in particular, to fritter them away in exchange for uncertain gains in relations with Iran.
What makes the result so complex is that the ruling AKP got far more votes – up 13 percentage points from 2002 – but fewer seats than it had before.
A key factor was the increasing prominence and power of more traditional sections of the population from central Anatolia, where many small businesses grew big, enriching a more Islamic-oriented middle class.
The fact that two-thirds of the voters supported parties that were long considered extremist and whose allegiance to democracy is questionable has shocked many Turks, including those who comprised most of the ruling elite in modern times.
The president names the head of the armed forces, a power that could potentially turn the military into a servant of the government.
“Sledgehammer” is, sad to say, yet another alleged coup plot in a series of attempts to topple the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which was first elected in 2002.
General Yasar Buyukanit, the top commander of the Turkish Armed Forces back then, recently admitted that he himself wrote the April 27 memorandum.
If none of the above constitutes a breach of democratic principles, one wonders what would.
CAMBRIDGE – When questioned recently about a constitutional law professor who was arrested for lecturing at an institute run by the country’s main pro-Kurdish political party, Turkey’s interior minister, Idris Naim Sahin, couldn’t hide his irritation: “I am having a hard time understanding those saying a professor should not be arrested while thousands of other people are being arrested in Turkey.”
Previously autonomous regulatory bodies (such as the competition authority) have been quietly subordinated to the government, with no debate or discussion. 
The Gülenist media now set the country’s new ideological tone, producing a steady stream of disinformation in their vocal support of the country’s show trials.
For Turkey’s friends abroad, it is time for some tough love.
JERUSALEM – A few months before he became Turkey’s foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s chief adviser, met with a group of Middle Eastern academics and policy experts, including Arabs and Israelis.
This, he explained, was the reason that Turkey was trying to find an accommodation with Armenia.
Opposing new sanctions against Iran in the Security Council further alienated Turkey from both the EU and the US.
This is the exact opposite of a genuine “zero conflict” policy that aims to minimize tensions and enhance stability.
The region’s people are sliding into enemy camps, deepening their societies’ wounds in the process.
Second, there is an underlying historical tension between the large Sunni majority and the Alevi-Bektashi minority, loosely linked to Shia Islam.
Respect for diversity and individual freedom, and concern for generating growth and jobs in an atmosphere of social peace, must be guiding principles.
This kind of concern for the rights of all is a hallmark of Turkey’s young generation.
Domestic support for EU accession was 70% at the start of the negotiations, but is now closer to 40%.
Turkey was able not only to defuse the international tensions surrounding its Arab neighbor, but also to engineer the start of direct talks between Syria and Israel.
First, the rise of an Arab political class that is more influenced by religion than by secular nationalism has eroded the main structural barrier to Turkish engagement.
In that case, Turkey’s membership would not, as European federalists argue, lead to a weaker Europe.
As a result, in less than a decade, GDP has tripled, making Turkey the world’s 16th largest economy.
For example, we have quadrupled our trade volume just with our neighbors.
Every day, scores of people there die in pursuit of dignity.
Let us be clear: there is no military solution to this problem.
Turkey’s New Mission
Europe’s persistence in snubbing Turkey’s attempts to join the European Union, the rise of violent anti-Western popular sentiment in the wake of the Iraq war, and strained relations with the US – owing in part to the forthcoming Armenian Genocide Act – are major factors in Turkey’s change of direction.
The “Alliance of the Periphery” was a creative attempt to escape the consequences of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Surveying the regional scene, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has conceived of an audacious plan to enhance Turkey’s regional standing and extend his own political dominance at home.
A recently leaked account of Ocalan’s strategy highlights the risk, for it cites the PKK leader as threatening the government with full-scale war.
Under Iraq’s constitution, the Kurdish region is entitled to 17% of the country’s oil and gas revenues.
Turkey’s Rise and the Decline of Pan-Arabism
In Erdogan’s vision, modernization does not preclude a return to Turkey’s Islamic roots, nor does it require it to abandon its destiny as a Middle East power, even if this means flouting United States-led policies in the region.
Erdogan believes that, by exercising Turkey’s capacity for mediation, he will recover the burden of his Ottoman forbears as the guarantors of peace and security in the Mashreq.
Iran and Turkey are bound to assert their Islamic credentials more and more as they reach out to the Arab masses.
The Chief Prosecutor also formally recommended that Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, President Abdullah Gul, and 69 other leading politicians be banned from politics five years.
Its democratic content was also much weaker, assigning, for example, enormous power (and a military majority) to the National Security Council.
This may be why the Armenian Patriarch urged ethnic Armenians in Turkey to vote for the AKP in last July’s elections.
First, the AKP insists that it opposes creating a Sharia state, and experts say that there is no “smoking gun” in the Chief Prosecutor’s indictment showing that the AKP has moved toward such a goal.
This has caused consternation in both the United States and Europe, leading to growing concern that the West is somehow “losing” Turkey.
But Turkish democracy itself is not yet consolidated, and this is a precondition for Turkish foreign policy to become an asset for the EU and the US.
The EU’s role is even more critical.
Abdullah Gül’s election as Turkey’s 11th president marks a watershed in the country’s history.
He appoints judges to high courts and members to the Higher Educational Council (YOK). He selects the presidents of state universities from a list submitted by the YOK.
However, the contest is more accurately seen as one between an open and an introverted Turkey; between civilian, democratic rule and military tutelage; and between a globalizing and a protectionist economy. The AKP’s support came from both the winners and losers of globalization, from conservative middle Anatolia and cosmopolitan Istanbul, from the nationalist Black Sea region and the predominantly Kurdish Southeast.
Gül will be an engaged president.
With the political standoff surrounding the selection of a new president intensifying, Turkey is entering a critical period that could have a profound effect on both the country’s internal evolution as a secular democracy and its relations with the West.
These tensions have been compounded by differences between Buyukanit and Erdogan over Turkey’s struggle against Kurdish separatists led by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which the military regards as a serious threat to Turkey’s territorial integrity.
Given the key role the military plays in Turkish politics, especially on sensitive national security issues, Erdogan will need the military’s support – or at least its acquiescence – for any initiative to succeed.
So what is the EU left with? As its “hard power” ebbs, its “soft power,” as illustrated by the Copenhagen summit, seems to be very weak.
Europeans do not realize how little interest in “European affairs” there is in Seoul, Sydney, São Paolo, or San Francisco. There is a growing general global consensus that Europe is a pompous old has-been.
While the EU flatters itself on diversity, it is in fact one of the least diverse regions of the world.
Indeed, now it is the Union that will need to seduce the Turkish people, rather than the other way around.
He also isolated Turkmenistan from the outside world, forbidding access to the Internet and discouraging international travel.
Now Berdymukhamedov’s small opening provides an opportunity to build a different kind of reform-minded relationship not only with the US, but also with the entire West, particularly the European Union.
There are interest groups who benefit from the current system and the opportunities for corruption that it provides.
As the curtain drops, two developments will greatly influence the withdrawal process and the ultimate outcome.
Will these two developments bring about a stable peace, or will Afghanistan succumb to instability once more? And what consequences are in store for the US following this war without victory or defeat?
As a result, Afghanistan will remain what it was: a violent and ungovernable tribal melange.
Afghanistan’s history of occupation by foreign troops and their eventual withdrawal has been repeated so many times that one wearies of repeating the tale.
By contrast, the problems faced today – high energy and food prices and a crumbling financial system – have, to a large extent, been brought about by bad policies.
A country’s most valuable resource is its people.
A second major difference between left and right concerns the role of the state in promoting development.
The list of examples is long, but it includes subsidies to large corporate farms, tariffs to protect the steel industry, and, most recently, the mega-bail-outs of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.
The right’s deregulation mantra was simply wrong, and we are now paying the price.
SEOUL – Negotiations over the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula look set to resume.
In the late 1990’s, as China and Vietnam were posting rapid GDP growth, North Korea was ravaged by one of the worst famines in modern history.
We should think of North Korea’s economic transition process as a prerequisite for full denuclearization, rather than simply holding out the promise of a big assistance package as a quid pro quo .
Constructive economic engagement will be a tough sell outside North Korea.
The commission was to control the situation, and to ensure that serious measures were taken, particularly in regard to people’s health in the disaster zone.
Of course, the world first learned of the Chernobyl disaster from Swedish scientists, creating the impression that we were hiding something.
It made absolutely clear how important it was to continue the policy of glasnost, and I must say that I started to think about time in terms of pre-Chernobyl and post-Chernobyl.
According to scientific experts, one SS-18 rocket could contain a hundred Chernobyls.
Accordingly, most companies regard the entire issue warily, seeing only expensive disclosure requirements, constraints on their ability to collect information about their customers, and a potential source of legal liabilities.
But some companies actually want their customers to read and understand the statements.
B) 30%
Suddenly, the disclosure statement becomes a consumer application that adds value to the vendor-consumer relationship.
I see this happening already with a number of companies, including some with which I am involved.
But it is not quite as complex once Internet-based services provide the right tools – and once awareness and control of one’s own data become a habit.
The Electoral Court, however, decided otherwise.
Much more importantly, however – and perhaps to the surprise of many benevolent international observers – the Mexican left is nowhere near transforming itself into a modern, reformist, social-democratic party.
But they also entail the re-election of representatives and senators, recourse to referendums for constitutional amendments, and independent candidacies.
HAVANA – I was taking my usual morning swim, but this time on the roof of the Parque Central hotel in Havana, where the sun does not rise until 6.30 a.m. even in May. In the dim light, I saw a man poolside.
What did they want? Well, more freedom; the ability to be published and heard in Cuba.
I thought hard – and checked with Pardo and Rodiles – before publishing this column.
Pardo and Rodiles are probably better known outside Cuba than they are at home, thanks to the Internet, which allows them to publish worldwide, but which is barely available in Cuba. (I met them via Twitter, by posting a request to meet some “entrepreneurs” in Havana.)
Havana’s buildings are stunningly beautiful, but most are crumbling.
It is still unclear whether Google will continue to operate in China, but in any event we are not about to see much change in China’s Internet policy.
“Twitter can create a faster information flow than any official agency,” says Michael Anti, a journalist in Beijing who has long been at the forefront of the Chinese Internet movement.
Foreign companies, he added, could make available more secure browsers that would help “Chinese people to circumvent the GFW.”
In November, citizen protests against the construction of an incinerator in Guangzhou became a widely Tweeted event.
The world should continue to flood the Chinese market, and those of other countries that restrict freedom of expression, with cutting-edge technology.
Bolivia’s Morales also has managed to impose a similar Assembly, though with uncertain results, and Correa is wielding the threat of constitutional change against “the traditional parties, the native oligarchies, and the empire” – the common enemies of all three presidents.
Since its focus is the “law of laws,” the Assembly implicitly questions the status of all public norms and bodies, thus eroding the political system.
Indeed, often it is the state itself, now controlled by a powerful president, that mobilizes chosen groups, aided by the concentration of enormous resources in the government’s hands which has arisen due to greater state intervention in the economy.
Latin American populism has always nurtured itself on this dynamic.
Twenty years later, many revolutionary consequences of that night lie behind us.
After this terrible crime, countries – including in the Arab world – were ready to embrace far-reaching steps.
In Germany, which largely owes its reunification to its firm roots in the EU and NATO, Europe-weariness is palpable.
November 9, 1989, marked not only the end of the Cold War era, but also the beginning of a new wave of globalization.
Twilight of a Pontiff
In a conversation he protested: “No, the Church is not civil society, it is sacred society.”
Those of us who believe in a multidimensional culture will be grateful to him for his enormous efforts, thus for his “catholicism” in the original sense of the word, his all-embracing concerns.
This was all the more relevant to the extent that Pope John Paul II is not enamored with the United States.
For some time I thought that the Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States Constitution was probably the best way to ensure that political leaders do not overstay their welcome, and, just as importantly, wear out their effectiveness.
Of course, it is always very hard for leaders to relinquish power. Some have done so, more or less voluntarily, only to re-emerge suddenly from oblivion.
Disconnection is the beginning, followed by the belief that one is the only person who knows what is right and good.
Maybe it is time to be a bit more generous to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and look at the outcome of what he does rather than the way that he does it.
The original Barcelona Process, launched in 1995, was an excellent scheme.
There was some co-operation on common problems like drugs and illegal immigration.
We must also hope that his attempts to act as a peace-broker between West Bank Palestinians and Israel are blessed with success.
The New “Two Chinas” Question
China had overtaken Japan as the world’s second largest economy.
Corruption is pervasive, and Xi’s campaign remains broadly popular. But the wave of prosecutions that Xi has unleashed is discouraging Chinese officials from making decisions, owing to their fear that they could face criminal charges in the future.
A slow-growth China would undermine the global economic recovery.
Major social unrest cannot be ruled out.
This infant democracy was harshly interrupted when martial law was imposed in December 1981, with Solidarity outlawed and dissidents arrested.
But it took the Communists two more years to realize that they could not introduce economic reform without Solidarity’s assent.
While the election to the newly created Senate was entirely free, the opposition could compete for only one-third of the seats in the Sejm (the lower house).
In September 1989, Poland had the first government ever led by democratic parties in the Soviet bloc.
In a few months, talks between Communist bosses and their democratic opponents (often in the form of a roundtable) paved the way to free elections and new democratic governments in Budapest, Prague, East Berlin, and Sofia.

But that would require lowering the limit to walking speed – at an immense cost to society.
Making ever-stronger promises on top of ever more failed promises is hardly the right way forward.
When we talk about the environment, we know tougher restrictions will mean better protection, but with higher costs.
Like an off-road rally through a mountainous desert, it promises excitement and fierce competition.
In the Scramble scenario, nations rush to secure energy resources for themselves, fearing that energy security is a zero-sum game, with clear winners and losers. The use of local coal and homegrown biofuels increases fast.
Rising CO2 prices in turn accelerate innovation, spawning breakthroughs.
For example, Blueprints assumes CO2 is captured at 90% of all coal- and gas-fired power plants in developed countries by 2050, plus at least 50% of those in non-OECD countries.
I suppose it was the 50th anniversary of the so-called “kitchen debate” which he held with Richard Nixon that first triggered my memories.
Béla Király, released from a sentence of life in prison (one of the four death sentences he received from the communists having been commuted) was offered the job of commander of the Hungarian National Guard and the defense of Budapest.
We frequently met at conferences, where it was always a delight to hear him speak Russian – a Russian that had the accent and elegance of Tolstoi and Pushkin, not the degraded Russian bark of Vladimir Putin.
Király and Kolakowski became voices of moderation and reconciliation in the Hungary and Poland that emerged out of communism’s darkness at noon.
Although Europe’s leaders have made some progress on institutional reform, the measures taken so far will not lead to real convergence of economic and budgetary policies, or to genuine economic union.
·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Minimal harmonization of tax laws (such as a common basis for assessing corporate taxation) and social policy (such as further liberalization of national labor markets to encourage labor mobility);
In the Council, as in all cases of “enhanced cooperation,” only participating members have the right to vote.
To lose one international lending institution head is misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness (my apologies to Oscar Wilde).
Indeed, a week before Rato’s resignation announcement, the Fund asserted that it had the right to censure countries whose intervention policies threaten to undermine global economic stability.
On merit, some of the obvious candidates for the Fund job, such as Brazilian Arminio Fraga, and Egyptian-born Mohamed El-Erian, are not European.
Two wrongs do not make a right.
Despite such problems, effective measures were implemented to evacuate those at risk and limit the potential hazard from consumption of contaminated foodstuffs.
The JAEA demonstration projects can be used to develop estimates of cost and other resource requirements – and resulting waste volumes – for defined levels of contaminant reduction, but they cannot be used to specify or justify the numerical goals of the regional cleanup.
But don’t be fooled: Tzipi (Tzipora) Livni is nobody’s close friend.
Despite her brief spell in Mossad, Israel’s spy service, Livni is deeply civilian when set against Israel’s militarized landscape.
Moreover, Livni is as clean as politicians come.
And she is offering Jews and Arabs some hope, an open horizon, and low-key rationality.
But, given Livni’s record, she richly deserves the chance to try.
When it comes to the actual number of jobs available, there are reasons to question the doomsayers’ dire predictions.
This type of polarization has been going on in the United States for decades, and it is taking place in Europe too – with important consequences for society.
Labor becomes marked to market.
Rather than try to stop the unstoppable, we should think about how to put this new reality at the service of our values and welfare.
Many countries enacted regulations in the early 1970s to protect existing small shops against competition; as a result, the development of more modern distribution systems was delayed.
In Italy, the limitations on large stores created market power at home for those few that nonetheless managed to emerge and grow, but left them too weak to expand abroad.
And this is true in many other European countries and industries, where the structure of regulations protects suppliers more than consumers, hampering innovation.
Just ask any professional, university-educated descendant of a nineteenth-century textile artisan.
Taxi drivers in France and around the world are particularly incensed about UberPOP (called UberX outside Europe), a no-frills service.
While this problem always arises when disruptive new technologies appear, innovation and adoption are occurring faster than ever.
The final problem with innovative companies like Uber is that the financial returns overwhelmingly accrue to the company’s leadership, rather than to the service providers.
Working smarter is no empty slogan; it is the key to modernizing African agriculture.
The amount of spending on rice alone by Africans equals the combined national budgets of Ghana and Senegal.
Without protection, African farmers would once again be harmed by imports.
They are fighting back and, at least in the rice fields of Uganda, they are winning.
Indeed, with the English language now globally ubiquitous, the idea of an Anglosphere is little more than an artificial construct behind which anti-European sentiment can be hidden.
The country does punch above its weight when it comes to foreign policy; after all, it is a nuclear power and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Economically, the UK’s trading position with the rest of the world is strengthened by its membership in the EU.
STOCKHOLM – The next 18-24 months are likely to decide the shape of Europe for decades to come, and the United Kingdom has now started the clock on that process.
Next year should be a period of intense debate on a reform package that, when put together, will, it is hoped, be agreed by all of the EU’s members, because Cameron needs to hold his promised in-or-out referendum on the EU before the UK takes over the rotating presidency on July 1, 2017.
On the contrary, British withdrawal would likely inspire similar moves in other countries, with the risk that the EU, already weakened, might begin to fragment.
Support for the two main contenders – the Labour Party and the ruling Conservative Party – seems stuck in the low-to-mid 30s.
The closest anyone has come to putting some international fizz into the campaign was when US President Barack Obama fired a couple of warning shots across the UK’s bow.
The British economy is now growing fast by current European standards, so 2% of GDP is becoming a larger sum.
Ukraine, Russia, and European Stability
Ukraine is a leading example of the benefits that accrue when a country takes charge of its own destiny, and seeks alliances with other countries.
Indeed, since 1991, the West has offered Russia extensive co-operation with the European Union and NATO, as well as membership of the Council of Europe and the G-8.
But this comparison does not bear serious examination.
Russia’s foreign-exchange reserves fell by $16 billion in one week, and Gazprom’s value fell by the same amount in one day.
Its strong links to Russia are firmly in both countries’ interests.
But we do need to examine the nature, depth, and breadth of relations with Russia.
It would also have important implications for the Russian defense industry, notably air defense and missile production.
Ukraine has been pressing Russia to begin discussions on the fleet's withdrawal. But Russia has dragged its feet, suggesting that Moscow may seek to use the presence of the fleet as a means of pressuring Ukraine.
Russia encouraged and supported separatist movements in both entities, then used the separatist tensions to justify sending ampquot;Russian peacekeepersampquot; into the regions.
Ask Mikheil Saakashvili.
Under normal circumstances, there would be little cause for worry.
But, though this approach works in some circumstances, it is poorly suited for cases of genuine uncertainty like Ukraine.
Persuading the bondholders to agree would be challenging – even more so in light of recent court decisions in the United States that strengthen the hand of holdout investors. But there is no superior alternative.
When the inevitable restructuring finally came in 2012, it was, in the IMF’s words, “too little, too late.”
Ukraine is a victim of Russian military aggression, and, like it or not, its fate will essentially determine that of Europe’s, because the current crisis will define the rules and principles that Europeans live by in the twenty-first century.
Despite the war in eastern Ukraine, the country has managed to take important steps toward democracy since the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych last February.
A major weakness of EU foreign policy is its lack of versatile instruments for allocating financial aid to neighboring countries.
Today, the only thing needed to convert EU funds into financial aid for Ukraine is political will.
Ukraine’s fate has become Europe’s fate. Indeed, Putin not only wants to stop European political, civic, and social norms from taking root within Ukraine; he wants to roll them back in the Baltics, the Balkans, and anywhere else in Europe made politically brittle by economic crisis and/or demagogic populism.
Our national debt is mounting by the day to levels that inspired The Economist to suggest that we may become the “Greece of the east.” Moreover, much of our economy remains in separatist hands, and they, no surprise, are running the stolen assets into the ground.
For starters, the EU should help us create a more stable exchange-rate regime to overcome the currency volatility that has wracked our economy since Russia’s invasion. And, although fiscal consolidation is necessary, given the state of our economy, Ukraine’s most vulnerable people are now enduring a hand-to-mouth existence.
The shape it takes five years from now will be decided in the coming 3-5 months.
That is the wrong approach, and it is producing the wrong results.
He can choose between hybrid war and hybrid peace, and Ukraine and its allies are struggling to respond.
So Ukraine continues to teeter on the edge of the abyss.
A more likely scenario is that Europe muddles through by drip-feeding Ukraine.
Doing so would not only help Ukraine; it would also help the EU to recapture the values and principles that it seems to have lost.
But there were also lingering conflicts in Croatia, notably in the Eastern Slavonia region, adjacent to Serbia.
At the moment, I strongly doubt it.
There certainly are very difficult issues that must be sorted out before a peacekeeping mission could go into Donbas, notably the composition and formal mandate of whatever force is deployed.
We should be ready.
With Russia’s neighbors free to join the alliance, the natural result could only be a new dividing line, one pressing up against the Russian Federation’s western and southern borders.
The dispute over the fate of Crimea would continue; but an agreement between Ukraine and Russia on the issue could be made a precondition of the treaty’s entry into full effect.
European governments, however, remain unwilling to reconsider their position on supplying defensive equipment to Ukraine, and have instead reiterated that a diplomatic solution is the only option.
They would then be positioned to secure a “Novorossiya" statelet extending along the entire Black Sea coast, up to and including Odessa.
In such a charged situation, there will always be hotheads, eager to pursue military options.
KYIV – In 1983, the Soviet Union inaugurated two nuclear reactors in what is now Ukraine.
Three of Ukraine’s nuclear power units are currently operating beyond their design lifetime, with nine others set to reach the end of their intended lifetime within the next five years.
In other words, Ukraine’s dependence on nuclear energy, which accounts for about half of its electricity generation, has increased its strategic vulnerability to Russia.
Sending a clear military message remains essential.
Putting in place a rigorous oversight mechanism could help reassure governments and voters, and facilitate the country’s Association Agreement with the EU.
A greater emphasis must be put on preventing military miscalculations and unintended escalations, especially given the dramatic increase in provocations.
Ukraine\u0027s Borgia Campaign
Suspicions of foul play deepened when the opposition's second-leading figure, Yuliya Tymoshenko, a former deputy prime minister, was summoned by a Moscow prosecutor to answer questions related to charges that years ago she bribed a Russian military officer to benefit the gas firm she headed.
Yushchenko's promises resonate across Ukraine.
Pressure must be brought to bear on Kuchma to ensure that the vote in October is transparently free and fair.
These aspirations can be used to encourage Kiev to turn toward the West and democracy.
For a democratic-minded president to co-habit (as the French call it) with the very man who sought to sabotage Ukraine’s last presidential ballot would, I knew, provoke institutional paralysis and political chaos.
Economic growth since the Orange Revolution reinforces that reluctance, because an expanding middle class nearly always prefers the flexibility of pluralism to the thump of an authoritarian's fist.
As a result, something remarkable for a former Soviet country informs the habits of those who are demanding that their liberties be preserved: a deep respect for the rule of law, which is the ultimate check on abuse of power.
That Ukrainians will vote for their freedom this Christmas season is a coincidence of true perfection.
This left the regime to choose between using force to quell the growing resistance or cutting its losses.
Of course, our movement was created out of opposition: opposition to corruption, opposition to surrendering our national independence, opposition to the rule of the bully.
We will be guided, and bound, by the rule of law – and the spirit of ordered liberty that animates it.
KYIV – Politics and sports are often an incendiary mix, as the controversy now swirling around the Euro 2012 football championship, to be co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland, demonstrates.
Child mortality rates have declined in all Central European countries over the past 20 years, especially in Poland, where the rate fell from 17 per 10,000 live births to seven.
When spending is high, it is usually social spending that is badly targeted, which means that only a small share of poor people really benefit.
Poland introduced massive competition by dismantling monopolies and opening its economy to the world.
One year after our Orange Revolution, many Ukrainians see its ideals as betrayed.
Tamper with property, no matter how ill-gotten, and no investor will have confidence, they claim.
They reject the principle that there is a law which is superior to presidents, magnates, majorities, or mobs.
Another group also succumbed to this delusion.
Indeed, this did happen with the one property recovery that my government was able to secure, the giant Kryvorizhstal steel works that our former president’s son-in-law gained through a rigged sale at a bargain price.
If, as we were taught by Marx, belief in a higher law is a mixture of sentimentality, superstition, and unconscious rationalizations, then the predations that incited the Orange Revolution are in reality the only possible conditions in which we can live.
Ukraine’s Watershed Election
But the records of both alternatives suggest that Ukraine under those who backed the Orange Revolution will remain a member of the club of democracies and open economies, whereas under Yanukovich, Ukraine would turn its back on reform, and may re-embrace the grimmest aspects of our Soviet past.
Yanukovych’s foreign policy might not be openly subservient to Russia, but it won’t also be a clearly pro-western one either.
I have pledged that, under no circumstances will I form a coalition government with Viktor Yanukovych.
A Yanukovych restoration would be a disaster for Ukraine, for Russia, and for Europe, because it would put Ukraine’s independence in question and tempt Russia with dreams of renewed empire.
Most notable is the comparison with Poland: at independence, the two countries had roughly the same GDP per capita; today, Poland’s is more than three times higher.
The rest – Yanukovych’s renunciation of the EU agreement, the popular uprising that ousted him in response, two invasions by Russia, and thousands of people killed in the country’s eastern Donbas region – is history.
And the agreement with the EU must be used to drive the reform process forward.
That is why the emergence of a strong and democratic Ukraine from decades of failure is needed now.
Indeed, it is patently clear from his own words that Yanukovych does not accept the legitimacy of the Orange Revolution, which means that he does not accept the bedrock principle of democracy that you cannot cheat your way to power.
It is mind-boggling that an unrepentant, twice-convicted violent felon, a man who had sought to steal a presidential election – and who advocated a violent crackdown on the men and women peacefully protesting against his electoral fraud – should be a candidate for any office, let alone the presidency of a country of nearly 50 million people.
Although the whole world has suffered severely from the crisis, Ukraine was hit worse than most countries, as international demand for steel, which accounted for 42% of exports in the first half of 2008, collapsed.
Tymoshenko’s government also made a clean break with the ancien régime in the gas business, increasing Europe’s energy security in the process.

यही नहीं, शीत युद्ध के दिनों में संयुक्त राष्ट्र का योगदान मात्र एक कहानी नहीं है। उसके वि-उपनिवेशीकरण प्रयासों ने लाखों लोगों को साम्राज्यवादी दमन के जुए से मुक्त कराया। आर्थिक और सामाजिक विकास उसकी कार्यसूची में सबसे ऊपर आ गए।
इसके अलावा, संयुक्त राष्ट्र ने साबित किया है कि वह उल्लेखनीय रूप से अनुकूलनशील संगठन है; यदि वह ऐसा न होता तो इतने समय तक जीवित न रह पाता। जहां एक ओर इसे आज की दुनिया के अनुकूल बनाने के लिए इसमें सुधार किए जाने चाहिए, वहीं जिस एक और चीज़ की ज़रूरत है, वह है सात दशक पहले दर्शाया गया थोड़ा सा राजनीतिक कौशल, जब दुनिया भर के नेताओं ने अपने फ़ौरी अल्पावधि निहित स्वार्थों को उस तरह की दुनिया के दीर्घकालिक हितों के सामने त्याग दिया था जिसमें वे अपने बच्चों को बसाना चाहते थे।
Saya akan hadir, sebagai menteri Denmark yang bertanggung atas isu-isu iklim, dan saya yakin konferensi tahun ini akan menandai momen ketika negara-negara menunjukkan komitmennya untuk mengendalikan pemanasan global.
Pendekatan baru ini telah memperluas ruang lingkup perundingan iklim.
Kesepakatan di Paris akan menghasilkan kerangka kerja global yang sangat dibutuhkan semua negara dalam mengurangi total emisi gas rumah kaca.
The selection process is constrained further by an informal – but, after 43 years, essentially requisite – agreement to rotate through regions every two terms.
Indeed, that may be the main factor derailing the prospects of former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski.
Indeed, South Korea was the only Security Council member country to conduct such a campaign.
OXFORD – When the United Nations elects a new secretary-general next year, the world will face a crucial choice.
Ethical standards also need to be strengthened.
For decades, countries borrowing from the World Bank and regional development banks have begged for the loan process to be expedited; most cannot afford to wait more than two years to find out whether a loan has been approved.
Among their demands are a clear job description for the role, public scrutiny of candidates, and a shortlist with more than one candidate.
CANBERRA – The United Nations Security Council’s membership will be reconstituted in 2015, but it will not look very different from its predecessors.
The challenges that the Council faces today are as acute as they have ever been.
Too often the Security Council goes missing on the world’s most serious security and human rights problems, constrained by Realpolitik, out-of-date thinking, timidity, institutional limitations, or inadequate resources.
The solution seems to lie in some variation on the “Responsibility while Protecting” idea first proposed by Brazil (with China and Russia privately showing some sympathy), which would require some form of ongoing monitoring and review of military mandates.

समिति ने दावा किया कि संधि के मानवाधिकार जनादेश का अनुपालन करने के लिए, तंज़ानिया को उन प्रथागत उत्तराधिकार कानूनों को निरस्त और संशोधित करना होगा जो महिलाओं के खिलाफ भेदभाव करते हैं। उसने यह भी सिफारिश की है कि इस देश को महिलाओं को सीईडीएडब्ल्यू के तहत अपने अधिकारों के बारे में शिक्षित करना चाहिए और प्रथागत कानून से भेदभावपूर्ण व्यवहार को दूर करने के लिए समर्थन जुटाने के लिए न्यायाधीशों, वकीलों, स्थानीय अधिकारियों, और पारंपरिक नेताओं को प्रशिक्षित करना चाहिए। तंज़ानिया की सरकार को सितंबर तक इस फैसले पर प्रतिक्रिया देनी है।

Political impediments often enable lax arrangements to linger even after they are recognized as inefficient.
Institutional investors receive funds from individuals and invest them in publicly traded companies.
However, some events – such as a wave of corporate scandals or a stock market crash – can interrupt the ordinary pro-insider operations of interest-group politics by leading ordinary citizens to pay attention corporate governance failures.
It also assumes China’s annual growth rate will stabilize at 6.5-7%, thereby enabling the risks posed by pockets of excessive leverage in the shadow-banking system to be gradually defused, even as the economy’s growth engines continue to shift from exports and public capital spending toward domestic consumption and private investment.
This experimental approach by central banks has involved the conscious decoupling of financial-asset prices from their fundamentals.
The fact is that central banks do not have the tools to deliver rapid, sustainable, and inclusive growth on their own.
The United States’ trade and current account deficits have begun to shrink relative to American and world GDP.
The prospect of a truly hard landing – that global investors wake up one morning, suddenly recognize the US current account’s cannot be sustained, dump dollars, and bring about a crash of the global economy – is becoming less likely with each passing day.
Five or six years hence, the world economy faces the danger that it faced two years ago, although the fear this time is not of a sudden crash in the dollar’s value, but of a sudden crash in the value of the dollar and the euro against Asian currencies.
Indeed, just in the last year and a half, the European Central Bank adopted its own version of FG, then moved to ZIRP, and then embraced CE, before deciding to try NDR.
To be sure, most of the doomsayers have barely any knowledge of basic economics.
Commodity markets, too, have become a source of disinflationary pressure.
Perhaps more important has been a profound mismatch with fiscal policy.
All three of the remaining mainstream Democratic presidential candidates now agree that the existing state of the financial sector is not satisfactory and that more change is needed.
For example, Lehman Brothers was a standalone investment bank, and AIG was an insurance company.
Unfortunately, this is a great exaggeration.
Consider all the instances of money laundering and sanctions busting (with evidence against Credit Agricole last week, Deutsche Bank this week, and almost every major international bank in the past few years).
These policies are complements, not substitutes.
Perhaps the answer lies in human psychology.
Societies with well-functioning institutions allocate the burden of distress in predictable ways.
One answer may be to use arrangements that depend in a limited way on the legal system for enforcement.
Or they may hire informal workers who have no rights, or pay inspectors to look the other way (a related point could be made about workplace safety in Bangladesh’s garment factories).
How to Move China
Indeed, for all the characterization of China as a despotic state that one hears from the political right in the United States, its president enjoys fewer powers than his American counterpart.
Could they expect to see US troops and bases along the Chinese border on the Yalu River, or perhaps a string of listening posts to gather intelligence? Though such deployments would be inconceivable to most thinking Americans (indeed, the real task would be to maintain budget support in Congress and elsewhere for any deployments in a united Korea), Chinese security experts worry about it.
But the composed manner in which they delivered their remarks belied their countries’ long-simmering tensions over the islands, which have come to a near boil in the last few months.
Indeed, South Korea’s government denies that there is any dispute over the islands.
A survey of historical documents shows a distinct shift in Japan’s position on Dokdo.
In this context, the unconditional return of Dokdo to Korea – and Korea’s continued sovereignty over Dokdo – is indisputable.
Both involved terrible earthquakes that resulted in tremendous human suffering and large-scale physical damage.
Such predictions counsel caution against over-reaction by policymakers outside Japan.
The country’s sovereign rating is AA-, not AAA, as it was 16 years ago.
If this analysis proves correct, it implies that Japan’s reconstruction challenge will be more difficult than after the Kobe earthquake.
The Japanese have shown admirable courage in the face of unthinkable tragedy.
It is disastrous because it courts defeat by attacking superior forces: the 1967 Six Day War, Saddam Hussein’s challenge to the United States and his attack on Iran, Yasir Arafat’s fighting an endless battle in which he was always defeated, and so on.
That is why the kind of tactics that work well in conflicts elsewhere in the world do not function in the Middle East.
For its part, Israel will win an objective military and political victory but is not able to destroy Hezbollah for several reasons.
Naturally, most other Lebanese are unhappy that Hezbollah’s adventurism has dragged their country into war and inflicted great destruction on it.
At the same time, though, it will confine its threats mainly to the verbal level.
Sometimes errors are not discovered until later, when they are working papers, as with Reinhart and Rogoff, or after publication, as with Nobel laureate Ken Arrow, who had to correct a mistake in the proof of his famous impossibility theorem.
That sounds simple, but it is a much higher hurdle than politicians in Europe and the US have set for themselves in recent years.
Both could be expansionary – or not, depending on details and circumstances.
This is a crucial outcome.
However, progress has not gone as far or as fast as Pachauri and others would have liked.
Doing so would allow the IPCC to get on with its work – and enable governments around the world to focus on the challenges of climate change and the urgency of tackling them.
It is easy to see where Obiang – who seized power in Equatorial Guinea after killing his predecessor – gets the money that he tosses around.
My nieces and nephews in Equatorial Guinea still go to school on an empty stomach. They return home by mid-day to help supplement the household income by selling doughnuts in the streets – at a time when they are supposed to be completing homework.
Unfreezing Credit
Consider, for example, the real possibility that a large indebted financial institution faces a run on its deposits, as Lehman did, and starts dumping loans onto the market.
Any voluntary resumption of lending will necessitate reducing both fears and potential opportunities.
Perhaps, therefore, a mix of the two approaches can work best, with the authorities buying illiquid assets, which can help even unregulated entities, even while cleaning up the regulated financial sector, focusing particularly on entities that are likely to become distressed.
First, it must be understood that the EU and the US start from very different points in the race to reduce emissions. When the then 15-nation EU ratified the Kyoto Protocol, it pledged to cut CO2 emissions by 8% from 1990 levels by 2012.
But the bill that finally emerges from Congress is likely to have less ambitious targets.
Early and constant communication with Obama’s top climate officials would help the EU understand the likely US position.
Americans’ attitudes toward climate change have been transformed under the Obama administration.
Indeed, the UN has had two major recent triumphs, with two more on the way before the end of this year.
The precise value of the peace, poverty reduction, and environmental cooperation made possible by the UN is incalculable.
Some UN programs should be merged or closed, while other new SDG-related UN programs should be created.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains the world’s moral charter, and the SDGs promise to provide new guideposts for global development cooperation.
In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, great civil-rights battles were waged against racial discrimination and apartheid, followed by struggles to advance the rights of the disabled and sexual minorities.
Moreover, states are not legally bound to change the policies or laws that are deemed to be violating their international human-rights obligations.
Indeed, frustrated with adults’ failure to discharge what should be their duties toward children, young people are forming child-marriage-free zones, launching anti-slavery groups, and organizing education-rights campaigns.
For more than a half-century, no US president was willing to pay the political price for admitting failure and resuming diplomatic relations with the island.
Perhaps his effort to change America’s Cuba policy – which means challenging the highly disciplined lobby opposing the rule of Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl – will show the way.
By maintaining Cold War-era financial subsidies to Cuba, Russia has tried to ensure that the island remained a geopolitical flashpoint, as it was for the Soviet Union.
Ultimately, world peace is in the hands of leaders.
The government denied this, claiming that the experiments were conducted without its knowledge by academic researchers “for scientific interest.”
Indeed, Robert Schuman once declared that “Europe will not be built in a day, nor as part of an overall design. It will be built through the practical achievements that first create a sense of common purpose.”
North and South Korea must begin the work of reconciliation and community-building on their own initiative, as France and Germany did in 1952.
Although the United Kingdom is currently building two carriers of its own, the Royal Navy is years away from the capability to deliver instant airpower from the sea.
The operation, held annually and comprising 5-10 combat vessels, 1-2 auxiliary ships, and 2-4 maritime-patrol aircraft, includes forces from 26 European navies, and has undoubtedly helped to discourage, if not end, pirate attacks.
Adopting a comprehensive legal framework would be a useful first step.
While reducing such capabilities might seem like an expedient way to cut costs, European governments must not lose sight of their long-term security priorities.
Palestinians complained that the international community acted unjustly, simply because they were unhappy with the result of a free and fair election in the Palestinian territories, which Hamas won overwhelmingly.
Money, however, is not the only need.
The past year has been one of the most difficult years in modern Palestinian history.
Syria once boasted universal education.
It is truly fitting that South Korea is hosting this forum, because it is so often seen as a model of what investment in education can deliver.
The job is not done.
Less than 1% of the earth’s land area is densely urbanized, and even in the most populated major countries, the share is less than 10%.
But, to the extent that the products of land (food, timber, ethanol) are traded on world markets, the price of any particular kind of land should be roughly the same everywhere.
A few years ago Karl Case and I asked random home buyers in US cities undergoing bubbles how much they think the price of their home will rise each year on average over the next ten years.
Health and development experts, economists, non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies, and banks agree that the key to unlocking Africa’s potential lies in expanding women’s education, freedom, and job opportunities.
Simply put, women must be allowed to decide, free of coercion or violence, about their sexuality and health; if, when, and whom to marry; and whether and when to become a parent.
They are also more likely than older women to die of birth-related complications, and are more prone to abuse.
Attitudes can change.
Europe’s Hidden Stimulus
To be sure, the fact that companies are holding on to their cash, rather than paying it out in dividends, signals that they expect investment opportunities to return – a far more positive situation than in Japan, for example, where companies lack cash to invest.
Some degree of investment will add to demand, which may persuade others to invest – a virtuous circle.
In most European countries, action to spur private investment in local services and transport – both large sectors – should also be considered.
Over the past year, however, the shroud of mystery has begun to drop.
As part of his government’s efforts “to construct a harmonious society,” a tax on agricultural produce was scrapped last year, while the State Council vowed to boost annual investment in rural infrastructure.
He has revived the use of ideological campaigns, akin to those used during the Cultural Revolution, such as a requirement that Party members study The Collected Works of Jiang Zemin .
But it is equally obvious that Hu, the sphinx-like apparatchik in whom Chinese and Western liberals alike had once invested hope, is unlikely to deliver the more open and humane China that they thought he had promised.
When Putin welcomes Hamas’s leaders without consulting the other members of the “Quartet” – the United Nations, the European Union, and the United States – charged with shepherding peace talks between Israel and Palestine, is Russia testing its “nuisance value” or simply performing an “avant-garde” role for the other Quartet members?
Indeed, escalating tensions in the Middle East – particularly Iran’s nuclear ambition – is likely to incline the US to overlook Russia’s diplomatic prickliness even more.
But resigned acquiescence in whatever Putin’s regime chooses to do would only confirm it in its belief that it now holds all the cards.
In general, the exchange of information between the billions of neurons that make up the neuronal forest takes place through two types of highly specialized structures: chemical synapses (the majority) and so-called gap junctions (a substrate of one class of electrical synapse).
Furthermore, it has been proposed that glial cells are involved in information processing through their bi-directional signaling with neurons.
Nevertheless, even using this technology, full reconstruction of whole brains is possible only for relatively simple nervous systems.
If we succeed, we will finally be able to see the forest – without having to look for every tree.
The recent upsurge in milk-sharing can be explained by shifting attitudes toward breastfeeding in many countries, with the public-health and medical communities sending the message that breastfeeding is the best option for babies.
And, of course, it is possible that some breast-milk sellers adulterate their product to boost volumes and profits.
In this sense, though breastfeeding remains the best choice for able mothers, the single-minded focus on breastfeeding that prevails today could have adverse effects – at least in advanced countries where safe alternatives are available.
A “strongman” who cannot keep order in the streets is of no use to anyone.
Most Western leaders think naturally in terms of a “transition to democracy.”
But America’s long-term project is to remake the world in its image.
But, taking the long view, can anyone doubt that the invasion had the effect of shaking up the pieces, not just in Iraq, but across the Islamic chessboard?
True, America’s intervention in the Middle East also strengthened extremist Islam, breeding on the resentment that the US presence arouses.
Indeed, looking at the agenda they produced – more than 15,000 words and a headache-inducing 169 development targets – one might conclude that they simply threw everything they had heard into the document.
Other targets assume that helping “small-scale artisanal fishers” and “to promote sustainable tourism” are among the most important goals for the world. There is even a target to “ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature”.
In lofty language, the UN claims that the Agenda for Sustainable Development’s 169 targets are “integrated and indivisible.” This is nonsense.
People often attribute this to China’s hukou, or household registration system, which separates the urban privileged and the rural poor from the start of their lives.
Households can keep this entitlement for the term of the lease (now 30 years), but they do not have a property right in the land itself.
To achieve “permanent urbanization,” China must develop a new safety net.
Rather the key to success will be to make rural immigrants to Chinese cities equal citizens in terms of opportunities and public services.
The most important question to ask of any financial system is how much loss-absorbing equity major banks have on their balance sheets.
At the end of 2012, when Hoenig started to publish his US GAAP-IFRS adjustment, the average for the largest US banks was roughly 4% equity.
The latest significant development to surface is what Better Markets, a pro-reform group that has put out a helpful fact sheet, calls “de facto guaranteed foreign subsidiaries” that trade derivatives – a murky phenomenon that likely involves all the big players.
TOKYO – US President Barack Obama’s hesitations, ambivalence, U-turns, and political gamesmanship with the US Congress over punishing Syria for its use of chemical weapons has achieved only two things with certainty: it has raised Russia’s diplomatic profile for the first time in many years, and it has spooked those of America’s allies – from Saudi Arabia and Israel to Japan and South Korea – that rely heavily on US promises. To minimize the impact of both consequences, the United States now must enforce with utmost determination its agreement with Russia on eliminating Syria’s chemical weapons.
As Pakistan’s then-president, Pervez Musharraf, dismissively put it when I visited Islamabad as Japan’s defense minister, “Democracy?
His government continues to place great faith in the Japan-US alliance as the bedrock of Japanese (and Asian) security.
If America attempts to wash its hands of the Middle East in the coming years, will a similar rupture be inevitable?
First, would even a partial withdrawal of military force create a security vacuum that could be filled by a rival – say, China or Iran? And, second, would any diminution of America’s commitment to the region incite the kind of instability that breeds failed states and terrorist havens?
They will need to be clear with themselves about whether they have the means to achieve their national security ends.
The notion that the dollar’s global dominance is contributing to financial repression represents a significant historical shift.
If they failed to do so, their “undervalued” exchange rates were criticized as unfair.
The problem, as McKinnon recognized, is that these speculative inflows of “hot” money have weakened China’s macroeconomic tools and fueled ever more financial repression.
It is time for US leaders to recognize that what former French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing called the “exorbitant privilege” that the dollar’s global dominance affords America also entails considerable responsibility.
Indeed, whereas the US Federal Reserve terminated its large-scale securities purchases, known as “quantitative easing” (QE), last month, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank recently announced the expansion of their monetary-stimulus programs.
But a new issue risks bringing about a similarly problematic outcome: By repeatedly repressing financial-market volatility over the last few years, central-bank policies have inadvertently encouraged excessive risk-taking, which has pushed many financial-asset prices higher than economic fundamentals warrant.
NEW YORK – Since my teenage years, I have been fascinated by the permutations and machinations of national politics.
The Tea Party in the US is a case in point.
As a result, Western economies are running chronically below their potential – and risk undermining their future potential.
Over time, Western political systems will evolve to meet the needs of their economies.
Even now, seven years after the global financial crisis triggered the Great Recession, “official” unemployment among African-Americans is more than 9%.
But, with the bulk of the increase in incomes since the US “recovery” began going to the top 1% of earners, it is not true for most communities.
Inflation hawks argue that the inflation dragon must be slayed before one sees the whites of its eyes: Fail to act now and it will burn you in a year or two.
The Fed should simultaneously stimulate the economy and tame the financial markets.
But the killing of Eric Garner in New York City, like that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer and of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland in November, reflect the heightened risk that young African-American men face at the hands of the police in many US cities.
Over and over again, the same story plays out: a local power-broker is willing, even eager, to support the new US-backed government, only to be denounced as a Taliban member by a fellow Afghan – typically for local political or personal reasons – to unwitting American troops.
“There are those who will seize upon the report and say ‘see what Americans did,’” Feinstein said, “and they will try to use it to justify evil actions or to incite more violence.
We Americans must learn how to look at ourselves and our government the way others do.
All sides acknowledged progress toward eliminating Iran’s capacity to achieve a nuclear “breakout,” which would enable it to begin weapons production within a year.
It is now understood that even the sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime may have impeded the transition to majority rule.
The Revolutionary&nbsp;Guard is not worried about whether it is in the international community’s good graces.
But a strategy of compartmentalization requires focus and fortitude on the part of policymakers.
Weakness in the rest of the world implies a stronger dollar, which will invariably weaken US growth.
And Japan seems to be intent on inflicting on itself a second, growth-retarding consumption-tax increase.
The risk of a global crash has been low, because deleveraging has proceeded apace in most advanced economies; the effects of fiscal drag are smaller; monetary policies remain accommodative; and asset reflation has had positive wealth effects. Moreover, many emerging-market countries are still growing robustly, maintain sound macroeconomic policies, and are starting to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms.
Nonetheless, they are slowing down capital spending and consumption, given the option value of waiting during uncertain times.
After-tax income for the middle three quintiles in 2010 was 40% higher – equivalent to 1.1% average annual growth.
But that is not money that America’s poor can spend, so some downward adjustment should be applied.
America’s poor in 1979 lagged so far behind normal OECD social democracies in terms of health and health care that even though each extra dollar produced only $0.25 of real health-care services, that $0.25 was worth about one dollar to the poor in terms of material wellbeing.
After independence in 1947, India adopted an inward-looking planning system that focused on heavy industry.
Likewise, India’s annual per capita income of $1,760 is just one-fifth that of China. Even more striking, while 95% of the Chinese population is literate, the proportion for India is only 74% – and only 65% for women.
No one should expect an Indian-American alliance any time soon, given historical Indian public opinion. But one can predict a relationship in the coming years that will be both sui generis and stronger.
Meanwhile, scaling up infrastructure spending could provide an often-overlooked opportunity for long-term institutional investors.
There is little reason for US policymakers to accept this fate. Low interest rates, the dollar’s continuing role as the world’s main reserve currency, and the capacity of the public sector to increase spending make the case for higher infrastructure spending compelling.
Second, even if the Fed acts quickly, investor appetite for returns will anchor yields.
Given the deflationary impact of a stronger currency – and the Fed’s general intolerance of deflation – there is good reason to believe that the Fed will exercise caution in raising interest rates.
In this context, interest rates would remain capped, mitigating the risk of a disorderly bond-market sell-off.
At the same time, there is no shortage of money waiting to be put to productive use.
In 2002, Western financial institutions were thought to be wizards at managing risk and allocating capital; today, we see that they are wizards at market manipulation and other deceptive practices.
But today, there is no such way.
Last year, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released information about Luxembourg’s tax rulings that exposed the scale of tax avoidance and evasion.
New geopolitical realities demand new forms of global governance, with a greater voice for developing and emerging countries.
They have been a key element of Mesopotamia’s ruling classes for centuries, and their sense of entitlement is palpable.
If Maliki or Abadi were Nelson Mandela, they would recognize and act on the imperative to reach out to Sunnis and urge them to be part of the country’s future.
Overall, however, the US is addressing many of the region’s most important issues in the right way.
The Decline of US Military Innovation
The Navy’s research budget has been cut by some 20%, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – the organization tasked with keeping the US military ahead of the technological curve – has had to slash R&amp;D spending by 18%.
By contrast, America’s technology giants invest 4-6 times as much in R&amp;D.
“Continued fiscal pressure will likely limit our military’s ability to respond to long-term challenges by increasing the size of our force or simply outspending potential adversaries on current systems,” he said.
Now that Russia has knocked at least some of Assad’s enemies on their heels, the Kremlin has decided that the time has come to discuss forthcoming political arrangements – or, perhaps more accurately, the time has come to tell Assad what will happen next.
The administration’s difficulties in Syria emerged early on, with the assumption that Assad would be ousted within weeks of the conflict’s eruption.
Instead of attempting to impose a new Syrian leadership, the US should host a meeting with internally selected representatives to help them draft a constitution and make other political arrangements.
The Congressional Budget Office warns that falling off the fiscal cliff would push America’s economy into a serious recession next year.
The tougher problem will be how to raise revenue.
Opponents of tax increases should see that, because such revenue-raising is really cutting government spending, it does not imply the adverse incentive effects of raising marginal tax rates.
The cap rate could be higher, or it could start higher and be gradually tightened, or it could vary with an individual’s income level.
Unemployment remains persistently high, despite the $787 billion stimulus package in 2009, and house prices, though recovering slowly, remain far below their pre-2008 peak.
But governments can influence the development of productivity.
Such misallocation of resources was not just a menace of the interwar period.
It is no longer the real state of the economy, but rather the perception of asset markets, that is crucial.
The usual question posed about presidential aspirants is: Why is he running? This year, the answer seems to be: Why not?
She seems packaged and cautious, slow to get around to a position on some key issues, such as trade, that divide Democrats.
Evangelical Christians play a crucial role in the Iowa caucuses, the first contest in the quest for the nomination, but putting too much effort into pleasing them can make a candidate unelectable.
They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” – sent his popularity soaring, to the mortification of many Republican leaders.
NEW YORK – It is impossible to know whom American voters will choose as their next president.
In any case, foreign policy probably will play little role in the decision, as the issues that most concern voters likely to participate in the Democratic primary elections are domestic and economic in nature.
Questions will be raised about which sanctions are to be eased and when; about the terms of compliance inspections; and about what will happen once some of the limits on Iran’s nuclear activities expire.
The rhetoric, especially on the Republican side, will be muscular.
The answers to these questions should become clearer during the campaign.
So he promised that his party would try to compromise on a few issues, and offered an explicit pledge that there would be no government shutdowns like the highly unpopular one in 2013.
The Tea Party's rise exacerbated this split.
Numerous proposals are pending to undo significant parts of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature health-insurance program (if the Supreme Court does not do the job later this year).
To break the impasse, McConnell has proposed addressing the issues in separate bills.
These agreements go well beyond trade, governing investment and intellectual property as well, imposing fundamental changes to countries’ legal, judicial, and regulatory frameworks, without input or accountability through democratic institutions.
Admittedly, both countries went a little further than the US, mandating the inclusion of graphic images showing the consequences of cigarette smoking.
Fundamental to America’s system of government is an impartial public judiciary, with legal standards built up over the decades, based on principles of transparency, precedent, and the opportunity to appeal unfavorable decisions.
And high-priced corporate lawyers in the US, Europe, and Japan will likely outmatch the underpaid government lawyers attempting to defend the public interest.
In the US, where concern has been heightened by weak recent trade numbers, President Barack Obama is pushing for Congress to give him Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), previously known as fast-track authority, to conclude the mega-regional Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with 11 Asian and Latin American countries.
Countries benefit most from producing and exporting what they are relatively best at producing and exporting, and from importing what other countries are relatively better at producing.
The volume of trade increased rapidly, owing partly to NAFTA in 1994 and the establishment in 1995 of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Of course, if one country erects import barriers, its trading partners are likely to retaliate with “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies of their own, leaving everyone worse off.
America’s Education Bubble
In China’s case, the government hoped that broader stock-market participation – achieved through efforts to bolster equity prices and promote lending for investment – would make citizens more open to pro-market reforms.
This is where the US risks falling short.
But this is no excuse for complacency; it merely provides time for a concerted effort to implement measures that will ameliorate the destructive trends stemming from student loans.
And more could be done to expand income-based repayment schemes.
Software engineers call backdoors “vulnerabilities,” deliberate efforts to weaken security. They regard a request for backdoors the same way an automobile manufacturer would view a request for a defective engine.
An initial report identifies 18 proposals from more than a dozen European governments on subjects including new undersea cables, encryption, localized data storage, domestic industry support, international codes of conduct, and data protection laws.
Principle 1 requires that policymakers “promote and protect the global free flow of information”; Principle 2 insists on promotion of “the open, distributed, and interconnected nature of the Internet”; Principle 8 mandates “transparency, fair process, and accountability” across the Internet; Principle 11 promotes “creativity and innovation”; and Principle 13 “encourage[s] cooperation to promote Internet security.”

निराशावादी तो मानकर चलेंगे ही कि व्यवहार को बदलना बहुत कठिन होता है, खास तौर पर तब जब जीवाणु-विज्ञान के बारे में अशिक्षित श्रोताओं को सिखाने की बात हो। इस सोच के कारण निम्न आय वाले देशों के मरी��ों को एचआईवी की दवा किफ़ायती दरों पर उपलब्ध कराने के बारे में सबसे घृणित यही तर्क दिमाग में आता है: अफ्रीका के लोगों के पास घड़ी तो होती नहीं, इसलिए वे एंटीरेट्रोवायरल दवा दिन में तीन बार नहीं ले सकेंगे।

Uncertain funding prospects not only discourage scientists from pursuing risky or undirected lines of research that could lead to crucial discoveries; they also make it more difficult to recruit the best and brightest for scientific careers, especially given the extensive training and specialization that such careers require.
The problems are clear. But addressing them requires a prudent strategy that accounts for the structural fragility of the scientific enterprise, in which scientists must complete extensive training, regulation can easily stifle creativity, and funding limitations can substantially delay progress.
India’s Data of Discrimination
But Indian society, which comprises more than 1.2 billion citizens, is hardly homogeneous.
Moreover, in the same region, more than 60% of girls are married well before the legal age, making pregnancies among anemic and malnourished teenagers a common occurrence. But, at the same time, most girls complete 12 years of schooling in the northern mountain state of Himachal Pradesh, demonstrating that the north-south distinction is no more conclusive than countrywide generalizations.
On one hand, universities are abiding by long-standing agreements with government; on the other, they face zealous reformers who seek market-based solutions that stress competition among institutions, encourage staff and student mobility, and emphasize student-centered learning.
And if years of schooling do not translate into greater cognitive skills, then much of the economic justification for investing in higher education falls apart.
Policymakers must be aware of the educational and cultural damage that continuous reforms – all justified in the future-oriented jargon of the day – can wreak.
I live in London now, but my roots will always be in Pakistan.
In 1994, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto launched the first national vaccination drive by inoculating her baby daughter, Aseefa.
According to UNICEF, Pakistan has the second-highest rate of child mortality in South Asia.
Vaccination’s Lifetime of Blessings
In the remaining three countries where polio has not yet been eliminated – Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria – there were just 223 reported cases in 2012. This makes me optimistic that I will live to celebrate the day when this dreaded disease is stamped out forever.
Strengthening routine immunization will protect our gains against polio and enable us to reach the most vulnerable children in the hardest-to-reach and most underserved communities.
But, as I told them, they have a big task of persuasion ahead of them.
In 2005, on the UN’s 60th anniversary, the General Assembly, convening at head of state and government level, unanimously endorsed the concept of states’ responsibility to protect populations at risk of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes.
Wall Street employees received more in annual bonuses ($33.2 billion) in 2007, the year before the global financial meltdown.
But the essence of that agenda was – and remains – largely correct.
Whether deemed naive or belligerent, this approach undeniably upset and angered European politicians.
He could not influence in any meaningful manner the national narratives that had sunk deep roots in other European countries and thus undermined those countries’ ability to adapt.
MUNICH – Game theorists know that a Plan A is never enough.
Capital flight does not mean that capital is moving abroad in net terms, but rather that private capital is being turned into public capital.
If Greece abandoned the euro, a substantial share of these funds – which totaled €43 billion at the end of April – would flow into the rest of the eurozone, both to purchase goods and assets and to pay off debts, resulting in a net loss for the monetary union’s remaining members.
In other words, thanks largely to the ECB, the Greek government would be able to secure a far more favorable outcome – including increased financial assistance and reduced reform requirements – than it could have gained at any point in the past.
But are we in the West radically misinterpreting Muslim sexual mores, particularly the meaning to many Muslim women of being veiled or wearing the chador ? And are we blind to our own markers of the oppression and control of women?
On the contrary, they felt liberated from what they experienced as the intrusive, commodifying, basely sexualizing Western gaze.
Islam and Judaism never had that same kind of mind-body split.
Veils of Ignorance
This is not the case - at least not yet - in Europe, where the majority, according to the same survey, believes that poor people are ordinary people who have been unlucky.
Suddenly, two days of training became sufficient before starting real jobs; the failure rate was low.
A bill banning any kind of negative discrimination against young women (including the headscarf) would have been enough to accomplish this goal.
Now its president is lashing out at academics.
The toll of this “taxation” is not confined to bondholders: pensioners, depositors, and anyone else with claims against the government – or who holds a bolívar – is affected.
But let’s not pretend that such a step is unprecedented in Venezuela’s history.
WASHINGTON, DC – The congressional elections to be held in Venezuela in December offer a flicker of hope to a country facing dark prospects.
And, fifth, observers must be free to issue public statements and reports with their findings and recommendations.
The observers are to request explicit approval for any visit, interview, or meeting to be carried out at the office of any electoral authority.
Venezuela’s democratic opposition has finally united behind a single candidate, Manuel Rosales, to challenge the incumbent populist maverick Hugo Chávez in the presidential election scheduled for December 3rd.
Under Rosales, Venezuela’s relations with its biggest trading partner, the United States, would also be re-established in a climate of mutual respect.
Forty-four thousand students are currently part of the
Whichever way it goes – even if Chávez really is recovering as quickly as he would have us believe – talk in Venezuela about the post-Chávez era has already begun.
But neither his tweets, his image as a sportsman, his government’s televised ministerial meetings, nor the articles in which he lashes out at the opposition have been able to stem a growing perception that his illness has launched an uncertain transition.
In the wake of his illness, Chávez is trying to strengthen his movement.
The military can choose to uphold the elected government, regardless of which party wins, or prevent the eventual triumph of the opposition Mesa de Unidad.
We spent a lot of time considering which short-term measures (specifically excluding government regulations and policy) could make a difference. We came to the conclusion that what start-ups need most is greater access to mentors.
If they can’t be bothered to get the details right, why should I waste my time with them?
Each side needs the other – and needs to keep the other side in check.
They may want a chance to try things again through someone else.
Moreover, their triumphalist rejoicing is a cruel reminder that when the oppressed become liberated, they can very easily turn into oppressors themselves.
There is no power – save a new violent dictatorship – that can bring Shi’a, Sunnis, and Kurds to live once again in one body politic.
The consequences of this re-ordering of power are not yet clear.
This week, Austria is providing the world an opportunity to rethink its complacency.
On more than one occasion, the actions of plucky individuals, applying their intelligence against orders, saved us from catastrophe.
As long as some states possess them, other states will be led by envy or fear to desire their own.
TOKYO – For 30 years after World War II’s end, Vietnam claimed the global spotlight.
And earlier this summer, while hosting US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vietnam encouraged her to intervene in the growing maritime disputes between China and Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan, and Vietnam itself.
But, when the fighting ended, it was Deng who had to absorb most of the lessons.
Vietnam’s total trade turnover now equals 160% of GDP, making it one of the world’s most open economies.
For example, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) offer free or low-cost, high-quality higher-education classes to hundreds of thousands of people on the Internet, making it easier to learn whatever – and wherever – they want.
Fortunately, many governments are taking steps to promote the online education revolution. Malaysia’s government has announced a plan to provide lightweight laptops to primary and secondary schools nationwide, and has adopted free Web-based email, calendar, and document processing for ten million students, teachers, and parents.
With sufficient bandwidth, students can now meet virtually via Google+ Hangouts or other social-media platforms and study together – or with the leading experts on the planet. Thanks to the Internet, distances no longer matter: the world really can be our classroom.
Laws against child pornography in other countries may also have the effect of prohibiting games that permit virtual sex with virtual children.
Those who play violent video games are often at an impressionable age.
To date, such lawsuits have been dismissed, at least in part on the grounds that the manufacturers could not foresee that their products would cause people to commit crimes.
Africa’s Inclusive Growth Potential
Creating a sufficient number of rewarding jobs is a substantial challenge.
Similarly, with 60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land, Africa has a huge opportunity to feed the world’s growing population and promote agriculture as a business.
Infrastructure projects, by their very nature, are long-term and exposed to political vicissitudes; but investors need regulatory certainty.
Providing exit options where none now exist could also seed an explosive growth in private equity capital.
Today, shared interests have shrunk and values have diverged.
The first option may involve international conflict, the second domestic conflict.
This is the kind of civilizational choice that sovereign countries are entitled to make for themselves.
Twice in the twentieth century – in 1931 and again in 1969-70 – France helped to bring down the world monetary system.
In the West, he is regarded as an “authoritarian,” an “autocrat,” even as a “dictator” while in Russia a huge majority regard him as the most “democratic” of leaders, on the grounds that he has done more than his predecessors to improve the lot of ordinary people.
More important is that an almost equally large majority values the power to hire and fire their czar – in free elections held at regular intervals in line with the constitution.
Integrating the presidency into broader political structures and procedures – especially into party politics – would reduce this risk.
The habit of changing the rules to keep power would persist after the strongman eventually leaves the scene, but the superficial stability of his rule would not.
The Internet remains vibrant, and street protests continue to be held in major cities.
For starters, the nationwide anti-Putin demonstrations last winter and spring should not be underestimated.
This is why former President Dmitri Medvedev’s “rise and fall,” staged like a soap opera, has played a socially corrosive role.
Vladimir Putin’s Potemkin Nation
Upon assuming the presidency in 2008, Medvedev proclaimed: “We must achieve a true respect for law, and overcome the legal nihilism that is hampering modern development.”  And, in a much discussed newspaper article entitled “Russia Forward,” he declared, “Should we continue to drag into the future our primitive raw-materials economy, endemic corruption, and inveterate habit of relying on the state to solve our problems?
He does not need to modernize Russia so that it can actually compete with the world’s mightiest powers; he just needs to bluster enough that people – particularly his own – believe that Russia is once again among the first rank of nations.
Journalists and human rights activists and lawyers – Anna Politkovskaya, Stanislav Markelov, Anastasia Baburova, Natalia Estemirova, and dozens of others – are murdered, and no one in the Kremlin seems to mind, because they are not really a part of the New Russia that Putin is building. Indeed, just this November, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management, died in prison because of his captors’ negligence.
Indeed, an ethos of perpetual vigilance is central to sustaining President Vladimir Putin’s high popular-approval ratings.
The supposed threat to Russia today was underscored for the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, with billboards springing up across Moscow to remind Russians of the sacrifices that victory required.
Now, however, many seem ready to give up this right.
It is an insidious and effective strategy, one that marginalizes dissenters and generates the impression of near-universal support for the regime.
The first timeline certainly receives the most attention.
And the rise of Kurdish military forces against them raises the possibility that a full-fledged Kurdish state will eventually emerge.
Having learned the hard way that they cannot dictate regional political outcomes, Western powers – as well as Russia, China, and India – will likely limit their involvement to protecting their direct interests and, if necessary, containing regional threats.
Of course, these ideas would amount to little were they not backed by modern weaponry, and had the countries whose territory the Islamic State is seizing not failed to create inclusive social contracts.
As the Ukraine crisis unfolded, Russian policymakers and commentators talked about “the end of the Post-Cold War era,” while Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dimitri Rogozin even appeared to welcome the start of a New Cold War.
Cynicism and schadenfreude may also be playing a role.
EU member states have no interest in letting their continent slip back into ethnic nationalism and power politics.
But what it can do is launch a much-needed political process and, more important, produce a ceasefire agreement between government and opposition forces.
Meanwhile, the Assad regime benefits from the fact that parts of the country that it no longer controls cannot be called “liberated zones,” given the prevailing chaos and extremism in these areas.
Moreover, a ceasefire would enable the FSA and its allies to coordinate action with units of the regular army against Al Qaeda bands, which would undoubtedly try to sustain the violence.
BERLIN – The Russian-American plan to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons – now embodied in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 – may open a more constructive approach to ending the country’s civil war, because the Security Council is also demanding that the long-planned Geneva II conference on Syria convene as soon as possible.
Such region-wide instability is not just a theoretical scenario; it follows from developments on the ground.
From Turkey’s perspective, a confederation of Syria’s northeastern region with the KRG might be favorable to continuing domestic Kurdish unrest, much less rule by the anti-Turkish Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) along its border with Syria.
Rather than pondering or devising new borders, regional and external powers need to focus their efforts on holding Syria together.
Warring parties start to negotiate seriously only if and when they know that other alternatives are out of reach.
You might think she heads a charity, rather than Kingfisher, a home-improvement retailer with some 1,200 stores across Europe and Asia.
In 2014, the International Council on Clean Transportation commissioned West Virginia University’s Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines, and Emissions to do just that.
It is even more obviously true if value includes the sense of satisfaction that all those involved take from their work.
Life goes on.
Critics consider it a form of insider dealing.
Everyone knows that actual fuel economy does not correspond to the numbers on the showroom sticker, which are generated by tests carried out with the wind blowing from behind or on a particularly smooth road surface.
As regulators’ focus turned toward limiting global warming, there were tremendous incentives to manufacture vehicles that produced fewer greenhouse-gas emissions, even if that meant, as with diesel engines, emitting other gases and micro-particles that are much more harmful to humans in their vicinity.
Its consequences are about to catch up with America, and the world.
Thus, it made sense to pursue a fiscal stimulus of some kind in early 2009.
Most American politicians like to think and talk only about the US.
Some people expected Paul Ryan, a rising star within the Republican Party who will become Chairman of the House budget committee in the next Congress, to provide a fiscally responsible anchor to the next round of the deficit debate in the US.
Sarkozy, despite initial attempts to roll back some French entitlements, has thus far produced less reform than Cameron or Harper, let alone Ronald Reagan or Margaret Thatcher in the 1980’s.

But the size of the welfare state – and the erosion of incentives to work, save, and invest, owing to high taxes and bloated transfer payments – is a major impediment to faster income growth.
But comparing the US, Canada, the UK, and France reveals that the stakes are immense.

In this time of crisis and unemployment, the American public may question freer trade.
If he achieves this, Obama’s long trip will be valuable for Americans, and Asians will realize that it was worth waiting for him.
Those negotiations failure are generally attributed to India and the United States, but most observers seem to agree that America’s responsibility was greater.
These attitudes also largely echo their less convincing economic performance.
As regulation is a form of competition between governments, focusing on improved regulation increasingly looks like the best channel of influence available to OECD countries.
Even though each new store takes away business from Wal-Mart stores established nearby, ever-improving supply efficiencies help maintain the chain’s overall growth.
I have nothing against big box stores.
Big-box stores are not exactly attractive – hence their name. If they continue their explosive growth over the next 20 years, will Americans someday come to regard their proliferation as a spectacular example of the failure to adopt region-wide blueprints for balanced growth?
Americans, in turn, must think about where the proper balance lies between aesthetics, community, and low prices.
It was suggested that these outcomes required a force equivalent to a multi-story fall or major motor-vehicle accident, causing immediate symptoms or collapse.
These findings, combined with the immature anatomy of the infant dura, suggest that dural bleeding in young babies may be a natural protective device – a reservoir to prevent backflow into the brain’s blood vessels during the pressure fluctuations of normal labor and delivery.
They simply predict the likelihood that specific findings will be categorized as abusive, and that, consequently, the child’s caregiver at the time will be accused or convicted of abuse, regardless of the accuracy of the diagnosis.
After a reportedly tough meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vice Marshall Choe Ryong-hae, one of the four members of North Korea’s ruling presidium, the US-China summit in California took place with North Korea as one of the central points of discussion.
Though Chinese leaders became more active by hosting the six-party talks, they still regarded their role as that of mediator between the US and the North, rather than that of a party whose security interests were seriously affected by events on the Korean Peninsula.
Chinese leaders may still view North Korea as a strategic buffer state, but China’s status as a global power is pushing them to view the North in a new way.
Those improved ties matter, because the time has come for China to rebalance its traditional geostrategic interests with its role as a global leader.
However, this impression – correct where the past is concerned – might prove deceptive in the future, because two global megatrends will subject the region to more profound change than all the many previous political crises and wars were able to bring about.
And the same applies to the increasing demand for energy: although the region as a whole is rich in energy resources, their uneven geographical distribution suggests that any viable solution must be built on cooperation.
This would, finally, give the Middle East – a region poor in growth and rich in conflicts – a distinct identity, making it a player in global economic terms as well, and thus enabling it to become the architect of its own future.
Brazil’s finance minister speaks of a latent currency war, and he is not far off the mark: it is in the currency markets that different economic policies and different economic and political systems interact and clash.
It is no exaggeration to say that since the financial crisis, China has been in the driver’s seat of the world economy.
Countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Brazil are intervening unilaterally in currency markets.
At nearly 70% of GDP, consumption in the US is too high.
Whether it recognizes it or not, China has emerged as a world leader.
History is replete with examples of war expanding the voice of those who provided the resources to fight.
Modern democracy, with its mix of universal suffrage and property rights, looks remarkably like a compromise born of centuries of military competition among constitutionally evolving states, according to which the general public supplies the manpower to fight and moneyed interests supply the capital to train and equip the troops.
Volunteer soldiers – including many non-citizens – and mercenary units for manpower reduce even further the reasons for voters to care.
We do know, however, that until now governments have had to subject themselves to increased political oversight when they needed manpower or money to fight wars.
Still others are men and boys recruited and press-ganged into militia units.
Thousand more peacekeepers – let many of them be women – must be deployed in the affected provinces.
Whether it is civil war, pogroms, or other armed conflicts, all too often women’s bodies become part of the battlefield.
In cultures where girls and women are married off and chastity is central to womanhood, all is lost for a woman who loses her honor.
So it is all the more striking – and painful – that for so long this specific war crime has received little attention.
Recently, the Congolese militia leader Thomas Lubanga became the first prisoner to be tried at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for the recruitment of child soldiers.
Maybe then its judges would pay closer attention to sexual violence against women.
As a result, the banks have been focused on returning the bailout funds at the earliest opportunity, rather than using them to boost lending.
But, “[t]o reflate the economy,” he told us, “the Fed doesn’t have to restore business investment; any kind of increase in demand will do.”
The Irish National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) was set up in 2009 to clean up Irish banks’ balance sheets.
To rely instead on central banks to refloat the US and European economies is an abdication of responsibility that will cost us dearly in the future.
At the moment, the UN is considering 169 new development targets to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (hunger is one target area, among many).
More than three-quarters of the waste occurs well before the kitchen, in inefficient agriculture, because birds and rats eat crops during harvest, for example, or pests spoil grain stores.
Most of these gains would be in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the world’s most deprived regions.
This month, water once again takes center stage at the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico City.
This is a situation that few people in rich countries face.
Ethiopia and Yemen are equally stark examples.
Water infrastructure can and must be developed in parallel with sound institutions, good governance, great attention to the environment, and an equitable sharing of costs and benefits.
If we calculate the time and energy lost in developing nations to gathering, treating, and storing water, and the health burden caused by a lack of decent drinking water and sanitation, the costs of creating a typical water and sewer network can remain higher than the benefits.
A single reservoir located in Ethiopia’s scarcely inhabited Blue Nile gorge, for example, could produce large amounts of sorely-needed power for Ethiopia, Sudan, and Egypt, mitigate droughts, and lead to improved irrigation.
A cheaper and more successful approach in South Asia mobilizes communities to achieve environments that are free of open defecation by raising awareness of disease transmission, health costs, and the social benefits of sanitation.
The trouble is that residential water use accounts for less than 15% of total consumption.
And, because this arrangement is tied to property rights, only the bravest of politicians dare to address it.
The adoption of technologies like drip irrigation would make current water use seem primitive and outdated.
Unfortunately, the Forum is not yet an official body and has no decision-making power.
The multiplicity of interlocutors inevitably creates a multiplicity of water systems with vastly unequal levels of efficiency.
But the acknowledged responsibility of states in implementing the right to water cannot turn them into the sole paying authority.
But humanity already seems to be making more progress on matters related to drinking water than other global threats, such as climate change.
As a result, the United States and Europe often spend tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars to send troops or bombers to quell uprisings or target “failed states,” but do not send one-tenth or even one-hundredth of that amount to address the underlying crises of water scarcity and under-development.
In Senegal, for example, a world-leading pipe manufacturer, JM Eagle, donated more than 100 kilometers of piping to enable an impoverished community to join forces with the government water agency PEPAM to bring safe water to tens of thousands of people.
Solutions will have to be found at all “scales,” meaning that we will need water solutions within individual communities (as in the piped-water project in Senegal), along the length of a river (even as it crosses national boundaries), and globally, for example, to head off the worst effects of global climate change.
NEW YORK – Vaccines are one of the great success stories in the history of individual and public health. They have helped rid the planet of the scourge of smallpox, are poised to eliminate polio, and each year prevent millions of deaths, reducing the suffering and costs caused by infectious diseases.
Consider this: In just the past few years, many candidate vaccines against HIV, dengue, herpes, tuberculosis, and staphylococcus aureus have failed, at a cost of more than $1 billion.
Today, technological advances in vaccine discovery and immune monitoring allow us realistically to explore this potentially game-changing approach to disease prevention.
At the heart of their concerns is the lack of sustained demand needed to drive growth. While structural reforms – particularly on the supply side – are required in developed and developing countries, they are not sufficient to address what former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has called “secular stagnation” – that is, the difficulty of sustaining sufficient demand to permit normal levels of output.
The Brisbane Summit therefore needs to rediscover the activism that it displayed in 2008 and 2009, during the height of the financial crisis. It must be led by the United States and other advanced economies, and backed up by major emerging economies.
Barack Obama’s first act as America’s president was to ban torture immediately.
The stakes, then, could not be higher in the “torture debate” gripping the US.
To drive this point home to the general public, which, in the US, is still easily persuaded by Cheney’s point of view that torture is justified if it saves lives, liberal commentators and politicians have called for a special commission to investigate fully the last administration’s record.
In the case of torture, that is the aim, which is why it is different from other acts of war.
In fact, the creation of the US Constitution and the birth of the American people offer reasons to hope that some of the most difficult issues facing Europe can one day be resolved.
Individual states held elections for their officials, but there were no elected officials (or parties) who ran on platforms and programs that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign state units.
Greece first tried and failed to use a referendum to impose its preferences on its creditors, which then used their superior leverage to render the referendum’s outcome moot.
And yet, in his book The Quartet: Orchestrating the Second American Revolution, the American historian Joseph J. Ellis points out that at the time that phrase was written, few in the country had a strong American identity.
That this is untrue is demonstrated by those, from Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez to Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, who are exploiting America’s loss of standing and influence.
In Ukraine, political forces resisting closer strategic links to the West have gained ground.
In today’s interdependent world, however, it is no longer the number of nuclear warheads that bestows influence, but a country’s ability to get others to go along with policies that it regards as serving its major interests.
If European governments today distance themselves from America, as their citizens frequently demand, they will both antagonize and further weaken the US.
But now Europe’s anchor has become a brake, hindering forward movement.
It was assumed that this would generate strong domestic demand in Germany, helping the periphery to export more.
This year, the public-sector budget might move from a small deficit to what German officials call a “black zero” – a very small surplus.
Public investment is the one area where the government could act.
Europe’s German anchor has become stuck, and the rising tide of anxiety among Germany’s partners should not leave its government indifferent.
Indeed, regulatory agencies like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) arose because common-law fiduciary duties failed to protect distant owners.
Faced with a no-fire rule, shareholders have reason to be very cautious: if expansion is not profitable, they cannot reduce labor costs.
So, where political and social values strongly favor labor, managers' loyalty to shareholder interests will be weaker.
The Failed State of Egypt?
Assuming power only stoked their paranoia.
Egypt has always relied on munificent benefactors to sustain its patchy state and economy.
The US should increase funding for projects that focus on governance, civil society, and strengthening the rule of law.
Whoever triumphs in future elections will lack the legitimacy that only a majority can provide.
Do events like the Paris attacks show that forecasting them is impossible? Or did the attacks expose precisely the type of risk that long-term projections should identify?
Machiavelli referred to it as fortuna:the events that shape us and determine our wellbeing are often beyond our reason and control.
At the same time, such moments remind us that future generations ultimately will judge us not on the basis of what we accumulated – whether personally, as organizations, or as states – but by the impact we had on those around us, and by how well we responded to their needs.
If taken to extremes, Russian society’s response to its wrenching modernization could degenerate into a nationalist revolution led by xenophobes.
Opinion polls, for example, indicate that 50% of Russians support the slogan “Russia for Russians.”
For example, no one even mentions the idea of introducing a dictatorship, abolishing elections, and so on.
What liberals should do in these circumstances is obvious: support Putin’s regime insofar as it maintains the foundation and institutions of a liberal order.
They point to the fact that the world's major central banks - the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan - have so firmly established their anti-inflation credibility that the inflation risk premium has been wrung out of interest rates.
What, then, is an economist to do? One could emulate J.P. Morgan, whose standard response to questions about stock prices, bond prices, and interest rates was to say simply, "The market will fluctuate."
As Ron Suskind reports in his recent biography of Bush's first Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, former Bush Budget Director Mitch Daniels once whispered to himself at the end of a disastrous meeting, "Not a typical Republican package.
BREMEN – An estimated 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 550 million in Africa and 400 million in India, have no access to electricity.
Until three or four years ago, photovoltaics were prohibitively expensive.
Many residential systems break down after 3-5 years when the battery dies, undermining confidence in the system among owners who assumed that they had a lifetime supply of energy.
WASHINGTON, DC – Ukraine may not be grabbing as many headlines now as it did a year ago, but the crisis there is far from over. The latest ceasefire agreement, concluded in Minsk in February, has contained, but not stopped, Russian military aggression.
A Russian attack on, say, Mariupol, eastern Ukraine’s second-largest port (accounting for roughly one-third of the country’s exports), would devastate an economy that is already tanking.
Europe’s leaders claim that they want to avoid giving Russia reason to escalate its war on Ukraine. But that is already happening, and Ukraine’s fight against Russia is, after all, a defense of core European values – and, indeed, of Europe itself.
The eurozone’s GDP remains mired below 2008 levels, and the United States last enjoyed Chinese-style growth back in 1984, when gasoline was $1.10 a gallon and the first Apple Macintosh was rolling off the production line in California.
Coming from the other direction, China’s crawl toward a more market-oriented brand of capitalism also has potential pitfalls.
By contrast, China’s rapid growth should not obscure its need for economic change.
One thing is certain: enlargement has confronted Western Europe with extremely stiff wage competition.
Since unemployment is low among the more highly qualified, higher demand for their services will lead to an increase in wages rather than an increase in employment.
Considering all these factors, the assertion that the EU’s eastward enlargement will lead to net job creation in Western Europe appears to be nothing more than empty politically correct rhetoric.
For example, there is talk of installing anti-missile defense systems in Poland in proximity to the Russian border, supposedly to prevent terrorist missile strikes, which by definition cannot reach Poland.
They will be fought for, and bloodshed is not hard to imagine.
The Age of Financial Repression
When the economy is growing, automatic stabilizers work their magic.
Among other things, Basel III stipulates that banks do not have to set aside cash against their investments in government bonds with ratings of AA- or higher.
A senior Italian banker once said that Italian banks would be hanged by the Ministry of Finance if they sold any of their government-debt holdings.
But lately an even more troubling sentiment seems to have emerged, with Western leaders willing to settle not for “our son of a bitch,” but for just about any son of a bitch who can impose stability, whatever the cost.
Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel noted the necessity of including Assad in talks about Syria’s future.

Unfortunately, Western leaders have repeatedly shown that they lack the patience and dedication needed to engage consistently and humbly with communities in crisis-stricken countries or to provide the reliable, incremental, and prolonged governance assistance needed to prevent state collapse.
But they are definitely stirring up the politics of fear.
But it is hardly an existential threat.
ISIS, despite its claims, is not a state, and Hollande should not treat it as one.
Republican candidates in the US are already using the recent murder spree in Paris to blame President Barack Obama, and by extension any future Democratic candidate, for being weak.
Indeed, the Black Sea region is the Euro-Atlantic community's eastern frontier with the wider Middle East.
But both organizations need to reach out to these countries, a process that should be seen as the next phase in completing the wider Europe.
Recent events in Georgia remind us that resolving the region's "frozen conflicts"- i.e., those in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, of Transdneistria in Moldova, and Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan - must be a priority.
What About the World?
There is something of a consensus, for example, emerging around the notion that the US should remain in Iraq for some time to come, albeit with a reduced level of military forces.
There may also be latent concern about foreign policy in the attention being given to the quantity and quality of candidates’ relevant experience.
America’s next president will face a host of pressing and difficult foreign policy challenges – and how he or she responds will affect not only the US, but the entire world.
But the boom generated by such beliefs cannot go on forever, because prices can’t go up forever, and there are already signs of a hard landing. In the United States, newspapers and magazines are trumpeting reports in the last few months that the decade-long boom in home prices may be at an end, and that the bubble may be bursting.
Changes in people’s fundamental ways of thinking are not easily reversed.
Though a small group of collectors invests speculatively in antique or specialty cars, the idea of speculating in automobiles just is not in the public consciousness.
What Asian Century?
Nor does Asia cohere politically; parts of it are democratic, other parts are ruled by despots.
Asia’s lagging capacity for innovation is probably rooted in its rote education: Asian students, when they have the opportunity, flock to North American and European universities.
The fragility of Asia does not mean that Western domination is guaranteed: with its universities, cultural values, entertainment industry, and strong military, the West keeps an edge, but maybe not forever.
Similarly, there is no contradiction between the West and Asia when it comes to threats to global security, like terrorism or nuclear rogue states.
But, already before the recent debt-ceiling imbroglio, the dollar had begun to lose its luster.
There was no realistic alternative, I concluded, to a future in which the leading national currencies, the dollar and the euro, still dominated international transactions.
The answer, unfortunately, is no.
The Yale University economist Robert Shiller has long argued that national governments should issue GDP-linked bonds as a safer way to borrow, but convincing them has been difficult.
Couple these tax increases and spending cuts with the provisions of “Obamacare,” the US health-care reform championed by President Barack Obama, and, as of January 1, 2013, America’s &#160;long-run structural budget deficit disappears.
It is, rather, an austerity bomb that hits an economy in which unemployment remains high, the employment-to-population ratio remains horrifyingly low, and there are only feeble signs that the large gap between current and potential output is closing.
Third, the large government-sponsored mortgage enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should be used as macroeconomic-policy tools to restore housing construction to its long-term trend level.
During the communist era, most people believed that individual efforts to effect change did not make sense.
In general, Western societies, it seems, are experiencing a certain crisis of the democratic ethos and active citizenship.
Instead, we witness a process of economic globalization that has escaped political control and, as such, is causing economic havoc as well as ecological devastation in many parts of the world.
Industrial civilization, which now spans the whole world, originated in Europe.
This provoked a small firestorm of distortion in the West: “Wolf Wants to Institutionalize the Burka,” etc.
Her aim is to replace journalists’ acceptance of the “party line” – even if the party is her own extended family – with a more critical perspective.
Honor killings claim an estimated 5,000 women every year, and are increasingly common in immigrant communities abroad.
Indeed, there is growing concern on both sides of the Pacific that Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama intends to turn away from the declining US hegemon and reach out to a rising China.
Likewise, his proposed regional community would be open in nature, and would welcome strong US involvement, although without formal US membership, on geographic grounds.
Nor does it hold the two-thirds majority in the lower house needed to override upper-house resolutions.
What Euro Crisis?
Worse, the leader of the German delegation to the EU meeting fell ill and was taken to hospital upon arrival in Brussels.
I do not share this view.
The average interest-rate spread relative to Germany of the countries protected by the new rescue package was 1.08 percentage points on May 7, when the world was claimed to be going under.
Any political attempt to stop this process any sooner is bound to fail.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who often complained about trade imbalances in Europe, should applaud these market reactions, which were unintentionally strengthened by her president.
In the wider European Union, countries like the United Kingdom or Hungary are as much afflicted by structural deficiencies as some peripheral eurozone countries are.
Much remains unknown. Are we seeing tentative signs of escape from the eurozone’s malaise?
More generous support for countries in trouble is essential, because the euro must be preserved (albeit not necessarily on the base of a larger eurozone).
Yet, despite the gray and chill of March in Central Europe, Berlin exudes confidence.
He is a happy Berliner and a proud new German.
But to emphasize only these problems, as some French do, is pure escapism.
The places of power in France do not encourage modesty.
Greek government spending per quarter climbed to a plateau of around €13.5 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2009-2012, before falling to roughly €9.6 billion in 2014-2015.
Greece has not departed from past fiscal norms; it has returned to them.
Such measures would only help Greece to revive government spending.
Nurturing an abundance of imaginative innovators and vibrant entrepreneurs requires embracing a vision of venturesome lives of creativity and discovery.
Most Palestinians are in complete agreement with these priorities.
It is difficult for an international superpower like the US or a regional one like Israel to realize that a group or a people dare to have priorities different from theirs.
For the time being, and until this will is found, the world should give Hamas time to deal with the daily needs of Palestinians.
Hardest to understand, though, is why India is underperforming so much relative to its potential.
In any event, that election suggested a need to spread the benefits of growth to rural areas and the poor.
For example, industrialization requires a transparent system for acquiring land from farmers and tribal people, which in turn presupposes much better land-ownership records than India has.
As a result, industrial, mining, and infrastructure projects have ground to a halt.
On June 3, while I was visiting Guantánamo with other journalists, the press office there issued a terse announcement that al-Hanashi had had been found dead in his cell – an “apparent suicide.”
Al-Hanashi, it turned out, had been elected by the detainees to serve as their representative.
I have been putting questions to Lt. Commander Brook DeWalt, the head spokesman for the Guantánamo press office, about how al-Hanashi died, for eight weeks now.
Was al-Hanashi suicidal? Binyam Mohamed told the Associated Press that al-Hanashi was a positive person (and, one can assume, a natural leader) who would never consider suicide.

If Denmark were indeed to become 100% fossil-free by 2050, and remain so for the rest of the century, the effect, by 2100, would be to delay the rise in average global temperature by just two weeks.
Direct-current lines need to be constructed to carry solar and wind energy from sunny, windy areas to where most people live.
Even oil supplies are likely to be significantly boosted by non-conventional sources like tar sands.
DUBLIN – Both sides of the austerity debate that is now gripping economists and policymakers cite Ireland’s experience as evidence for their case.
Rather than restoring the banks to financial health and ensuring responsible behavior, the Irish economy as a whole was dragged down.
Growth has resumed, financial-risk premia have fallen sharply, foreign investment is picking up, and exports are booming.
Yet there is some good analytical news.
Efforts to regain national control of the country’s destiny, the Irish seem to believe, must take time.

And an additional 6.7 million are working part-time but would like to work more hours per week.
This group is eligible for Social Security (pensions) and Medicare (health insurance), and the majority are retired.
Or consider minimum-wage legislation, which reduces employers’ willingness to hire low-skilled workers.
Investors in the coming years will need to be persuaded to hold mountains of new debt.
Indeed, few governments have submitted remotely realistic budget projections, typically relying on overly rosy economic scenarios.
Countries with European-style growth rates could handle debt obligations of 60% of GDP when interest rates were low. But, with debts in many countries rising to 80% or 90% of GDP, and with today’s low interest rates clearly a temporary phenomenon, trouble is brewing.
How much further will the dollar fall? Or has it already fallen so far that it will now start to move back to a higher level?
In falling, the dollar lowers the value of the dollar securities in foreign portfolios when valued in euros or other home currencies, shrinking the share of dollars in investors’ portfolios.
And that means further depreciation of the dollar.
BERKELEY – The International Monetary Fund has been one of the few beneficiaries of the global economic crisis.
The IMF’s first role is to assist countries that, as a result of domestic policies, experience balance-of-payments crises.
It would be more efficient to pool the reserves of countries that need them at different times.
The IMF, with its universal membership, is more representative, and it has a larger expert staff.
But, as the sub-prime mortgage debacle reminds us, large countries’ policies can place the global financial system at risk. The Fund, wary of biting the hand that feeds it, has been reluctant to issue strong warnings in such instances.
If the Fund does not provide a clear vision of its future by then, the opportunity will have been missed.
Where does Shanghai stand?
The non-Westerner, however, would rather place tradition above innovation.
The Western scholar remains perfectly legitimate when putting to death Western values: there is no Chinese or Muslim Nietzsche claiming that his own God is dead.
If we accept the above definition of the West as a mindset, this leaves open three major questions: can the East be modernized without being Westernized? Where do we draw the line between West and East?
Vast groups who live in the West, Western and non-Western fundamentalists, fight the unending Westernization process in the name of tradition.
Addressing them will require a broad range of policy interventions.
Meanwhile, rapid technological change, including distributed manufacturing and digital business, has put many people aged 50-65 out of work.
It is unfortunate that precisely when loosening restrictions on immigration would help labor markets, the world is experiencing a spike in xenophobic attitudes and politics.
That is why well-functioning labor markets increasingly require both firm leadership and open minds.
Land was relatively abundant and allocated by tribal chiefs without regard to Western-style property rights.
Instead, anti-colonial liberation leaders often developed personality cults and hogged power for decades.
Structure, institutions, and policies are critical determinants, as is the availability of qualified technical and administrative personnel.
On the other side, Europe and the United States face stagnation – indeed, a Japanese-style malaise – and stubbornly high unemployment.
The outcome of premature fiscal consolidation is all but foretold: growth will slow, tax revenues will diminish, and the reduction in deficits will be disappointing.
Politics aside, property bubbles leave in their wake a legacy of debt and excess capacity in real estate that is not easily rectified – especially when politically connected banks resist restructuring mortgages.
The problem is politics: in the US, the Republican Party would rather see President Barack Obama fail than the economy succeed.
PRINCETON – Barack Obama worked for three years as a community organizer on Chicago’s blighted South Side, so he knows all about the real poverty that exists in America.
Again, Obama has both the background – with his family ties to Kenya – and a promising policy, to increase America’s foreign assistance to $50 billion by 2012, using the money to stabilize failing states and bring sustainable growth to Africa. (Currently, of all the OECD donor nations, only Greece gives a lower percentage of its gross national income than the United States does.)
The global ethical challenge that has been most prominent in the campaign is climate change.
Monetary policy is usually the first line of defense in such situations.
But what could take the place of the stable exchange rate as an anchor for monetary policy and for tying down inflation expectations?
Only a shift in strategic focus would be needed to anchor monetary policy with a long-run target range for low inflation.
Unfortunately, the new sanctions are unlikely to be any more effective than the first two rounds.
The results amounted to little more than a pin prick.
But Europe’s negotiating experience raises doubts about that prospect, as Iran remains unequivocal about never abandoning its nuclear fuel cycle program.
Absent a dramatic improvement in the Middle East’s grim political landscape, the failure of deterrence would bring the sum of all the fears of our nuclear age upon us.
Unilateralism seems very expedient to shortsighted politicians, for it obviates the need for what they perceive as the mess of actual negotiations – that is, meeting their counterparts face to face and discovering the human results of their policies.
In the absence of relatively well-paying jobs, what will happen to the lines of unemployed Gazans? The potential flight of employment seekers – a formidable force worldwide – is only one problem.
Serious face-to-face talks, in accordance to international law and with the help of the international community, are the only way forward.
So while some members may walk out, Sharon can easily hold on to control of the party.
Today, most Israelis believe that this step, though justified on strategic grounds in the face of constant attacks by the Lebanese group Hizbollah, convinced Palestinians that violence worked.
Will it be able to put together an effective governmental authority to rule the Gaza Strip, or will that area dissolve into bloody battles among Palestinian factions and a staging area for attacks into Israel that will bring reprisal raids?
What Next for Europe?
Chances that it gets the budget approved this year are slim, and, unless the dispute is resolved soon, the Union will not have an operational budget by 2007.
Unfortunately, the host of the 2000 summit was José Manuel Barroso, then Prime Minister of Portugal and current President of the European Commission, who has staked his presidency on the Lisbon Strategy.
Now, with countless private interest groups trying to water it down into irrelevance, the battle will be firmly on the EU’s agenda in 2006.
It distracts the ECB, adds to the impression that Europe is bad, and, more importantly, will be used by ineffective governments as a scapegoat for their failings.
In the end, whatever light there is, it may not shine until 2007, after the French elections.
Follow it, and you will conclude that, ultimately, the war is all about the American superpower’s military victory over the Taliban, so that it can finally withdraw its troops – for a second time.
And in the north, the Tajik Northern Alliance and Abdul Rashid Dostum’s Uzbek militia were supported and equipped by Afghanistan’s northern neighbors and Russia.
On the other hand, the West’s strategy in Afghanistan up to now has also yielded little progress, only strengthening the Taliban day by day.
But the big question remains whether the US and its European allies still have the strength, perseverance and far-sightedness for such an undertaking.
Above all, the “no” votes in France and Holland – and rising discontent in other member states, such as Germany – are the result of the inability of national governments and the Union to respond effectively to the problems that most concern citizens.
The European Constitution has little to do with this, but referenda are never confined to the actual questions put to voters.
A key opportunity presents itself with the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration to define a common position to support democratic change in the Mediterranean by ceasing to back the political status quo there.
Diversity and inclusiveness, through the integration of European democracies with a common project, remains Europe’s great gift to the world.
The existing power relations in the Middle East have indeed been permanently shaken and, indeed, revolutionized.
The most the US can hope at this point is a withdrawal that saves face.
So at stake is no longer just Iraq, but rather the future of the entire region.
What’s more, it is threatened by a de-facto anti-Iranian coalition of all other regional powers, united by their fear of Iranian ascendancy.
Indeed, of the more than 200 countries in the world, only 30 use nuclear power.
But only five came onstream during this period – three in 2007 and two in 2009.
The view that the amount of energy derived from nuclear power worldwide will continue its slow decrease during the coming years is further supported by the 2008 annual report of the Euratom Supply Agency, which coordinates the long-term uranium needs of nuclear power plants within the European Union.
What Rebalancing?
In 2010, China ran deficits of more than $100 billion in processing trade with East Asia and surpluses of $100 billion with Europe and $150 billion each with the US and Hong Kong.
Europe’s ordinary exports to China increased from $85 billion in 2009 to $115 billion in 2010.
At that point, the US trade deficit will shrink.
For both men, the goal of clinging to power was a top priority.
Moreover, the opportunity provided by the oil boom was wasted.
So the government will prefer to muddle through the crisis, rather than risk any decisive reform.
The current government’s tactic of muddling through without changing the political system or the structure of the economy is fraught with the risk of gradual decline.
The economy seemed to have escaped its dependence on inventory accumulation.
This creates a strong incentive to default, because mortgages in the US are effectively non-recourse loans: the creditor may take the property if the borrower doesn’t pay, but cannot take other assets or a portion of wage income.
Lower share prices will now have negative effects on consumer spending and business investment.
Goldman Sachs coined the term in 2001 to call attention to profitable opportunities in what it considered “emerging markets.”
Although Russia accounts for only 5% of China’s trade, the two countries announced a similar agreement.
When one looks closely at the numbers, the heart of the BRIC acronym is the rise in China’s resources, but the role of Brazil is a pleasant surprise.
Poverty and inequality remain serious problems.
The Internet’s domain-name system (DNS) was formalized in the late 1990’s by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
The value is in people’s heads – in the meanings of the words and the brand associations – not in the expanded namespace.
But now someone comes along and says, “We will divide your land into smaller parcels and charge you to protect each of them.”

In fact, we were building an orderly market, setting policies for how much registries could charge, fostering competition among registrars, and making sure that we served the public interest.
And the way West Germany rolled over the wreckage of its East German neighbor seemed almost like an act of cruelty.
Society, Margaret Thatcher once famously declared, doesn’t exist.
People on the left would defend brutal dictators (Castro, Mao, Pol Pot, Khomeini, et al.) simply because they opposed “Western imperialism.”
Their promotion of American military force as the strong arm of democracy may have been misguided, crude, arrogant, ignorant, naïve, and deeply dangerous, but it was indisputably idealistic.
He has some modest ideals, and may yet be an excellent president.
So what should replace it?
It leaves open basic metaphysical commitments and takes a plural and tolerant view of religious life.
Jiang Qing advocates a tri-cameral legislature – a democratically elected People’s House representing the common people’s interests, a House of Exemplary Persons to secure the good of all those affected by government policies, including foreigners and minority groups, and a House of Cultural Continuity that would maintain China’s various religions and traditions.
Although the new tax law is generally described as a fiscal stimulus, it is more accurate to say that it avoids a large immediate fiscal contraction.
The previous temporary tax cuts in 2008 and 2009 appear to have gone largely into saving and debt reduction rather than increased spending.

I expected that many men of that younger generation would also have strong reactions, given how many of them are trying to figure out how to be with their children, support their wives’ careers, and pursue their own plans.
One major German magazine decided to frame my contribution to the debate as “career woman admits that it’s better to be home.”
After all, women have ascended the political ladder faster in many other countries than they have in the US.
In an article on “Women in Washington,” the National Journal observed that women in the US capital have come a long way, but “still face career barriers, and often the biggest one is having a family.”
The economy is slowing – the Bank of Korea cut its growth forecast for this year to 4.7%, while the OECD expects only 4.3% growth – inflation is rising, and some are concerned that Lee’s policies are too geared toward foreign investors and big business.
While most in the West applauded Lee’s visit, the reaction in Korea was significantly more negative.
The upside of all this political turmoil is that it demonstrates the vigor of Korean democracy.
But police officers across Europe continue to use it.
Given its failings, why is ethnic profiling so widespread? The answer is simple.
Over the past two years, a project that our organization undertook with police forces and civil-society groups in Hungary and Spain found that, when stops were systematically monitored and data publicly reported, the proportion of stops that produced an arrest or other law-enforcement outcome actually increased.
Campaigns are always more extreme than the eventual reality, but countries should be wary of calls for transformational change.
But inadequate understanding of the Iraqi and regional context, together with poor planning and management, undercut Bush’s transformational objectives.
Nor is this an argument against transformational leaders in US foreign policy.
But Shultz’s Stanford colleague, Condoleezza Rice, wanted a more transformational diplomacy that did not accept the world as it was, but tried to change it.
Educating the public to understand this complex globalized information age, and what is required to operate successfully in it, will be the real transformational leadership task.
I was the lone dissenter.
Indeed, intolerance goes right to the top of the Turkish government.
What sort of Union would that be?
That is why former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing feared that Turkey’s entry would lead to the EU’s breakup, and it is why former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said, “Accession of Turkey would be more than the EU could bear.”
Global institutions, not ad hoc groups of countries, must be at the center of the reform effort.
Three central issues of IMF reform should also be taken on board.
In all these areas, the IMF should make more active use of regional institutions.
A global system for prudential regulation and supervision; a revamped IMF managing a global reserve currency, coordinating global macroeconomic policy, and providing agile credit lines; and an international debt court – all of these must be on the agenda.
Moreover, for too many investors, Portugal, with its poor growth prospects and insufficient domestic savings to fund the public-sector deficit, looks like Greece.
Everyone knows that in case of fire, only the first to leave will be safe. So, if the exit is small, even the faintest whiff of smoke can trigger a stampede.
So each one want to be among the first to get out.
First, governments should not be pushed into insolvency just to save all banks.
Who will grant him asylum?
A state that emphasizes security over civil rights and liberties is easily hijacked by security agencies.
Google already has some experience in turning over information to China’s security services.
Russian society will also pay a price, with the NSA’s surveillance programs giving the Kremlin ammunition to defend the expansion of state control over the Internet and other aspects of citizens’ personal lives.
It shattered the Georgian military, grievously damaged Georgia’s economy, and stirred up discord within the Western alliance.
The intense personal hatred between these men overlays two centuries of tortured history between Russia and Georgia.
Gurgenidze also foresees negative economic growth, a huge budget deficit, and a collapse of tourism, which was just taking off in this beautiful country.
On occasion, he has berated the Europeans for insufficient support – not a good tactic for someone trying to join the EU – and has used rhetoric about Russia that, while understandable, only increases the danger to himself.
NEW YORK – Campaigns, be they political or military, are waged to be won, and the current American presidential campaign is no exception.
Where the two candidates differ is on the timing and pace of this drawdown, not on its general direction.
One of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture.
On other issues, such as trade, there are distinctions between the candidates.
It is on this question that the entire development-aid complex is based.
There should be no illusion that the transformation that the protesters started will be smooth.
For example, the US will again give more than $1.5 billion of aid to Egypt this year. But who is receiving that aid?
That may not be the sort of outside intervention that could cure the ills of centuries of repression and underdevelopment overnight, but “we” need to stop searching for a non-existent panacea, and instead do something better than feeding the Egyptian military.
That failure was epitomized by the inability to impose a peace agreement on Palestinians and Israelis in 2000.
Nor does the appearance of hypocrisy end there.
In strategic terms, the waning influence of a paralyzed Europe is also very bad news for America.
But there has been far less constructive discussion of new ideas about how to confront these risks.
Despite all the intellectual applause, however, wage insurance programs are still not a significant force in the world economy.
With government deficits the norm, that appears unlikely.
In other words, this insurance policy would protect against lifetime income risks.
NEW YORK – Here’s a concept you’ve probably never heard of: “viral sovereignty.”
Indonesia’s government has accused NAMRU-2 scientists of everything from profiting from its “sovereign” viruses to manufacturing the H5N1 bird flu as part of an alleged biological warfare scheme.
It is even more ludicrous to extend the sovereignty notion to viruses that, like flu, can be carried across international borders by migratory birds.
They must get involved. And China must use its substantial influence with Indonesia on this issue – in its own self-interest.
Bipolarity is a thing of the past, and it is unlikely to re-emerge in a new Sino-American “G-2.”
Without actually admitting it, the US was clearly unhappy that these two states tried to play a diplomatic role of their own in the dispute.
There is little reason to react with anger when states like Turkey, Brazil, and South Africa set priorities different from those of Europe or the US, or have different views about how to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iran, development aid, democracy promotion, or environmental protection.
The story would ordinarily be a mere curiosity.
Bewitched by symbols of affluence and a level of consumption that she could not afford, she acted like a child herself, with no thought to the future.
The manageable, honorable American Dream of the 1950’s – a decent, affordable college education; a small house of one’s own; hope that one’s children will be better off than oneself – was misplaced in the last decade and a half.
A better analogy for the No vote was the rejection in 1954 of the treaty to establish a European Defense Community (EDC).
Political parties and others who mobilized opposition to the EDC feared a remilitarized Germany and a threat to France’s sovereignty.
The reality is that Europe does manage to move ahead, but step by step through mutual compromise.
Europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity, and that Europe’s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitutional framework that promotes a common identity.
The numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be staggered over five phases, ending only on May 13, with electoral and security personnel being moved from state to state as polling is concluded in each place.
(Small ones were removed from the list when one candidate, running against another whose symbol was a parrot, wrung the neck of a live parrot at a public meeting to signify what he would do to his rival.)
It has been some time since there were reports of the occasional election worker, candidate, or voter being assaulted, kidnapped, or shot.
But, in Thailand in 2006, as in Egypt last month, they were happy to see their political leaders ousted by force.
Only the frail and ailing 85-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej still functions as a symbol of national cohesion.
One man, who was savagely stomped by a member of the armed forces in Tahrir Square in 2011, now claims that the Egyptian people should “stand together” with the military, and that all Muslim Brotherhood leaders should be arrested.
Nor was Morsi an Egyptian version of Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The other solution is to give democracy a chance.
PRINCETON – When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan in March, Brian Tucker was in Padang, Indonesia.
True, those walls did not work as well as had been hoped, but Japan was nonetheless much better prepared for a tsunami than Padang is.
One reason for this is that preventing a disaster does not make good television.
Instead, we should be guided by the best estimates of the chances that an intervention will save lives, as well as by the number of lives that would be saved, and the cost of saving those lives.
In other words, when the Fed even hints at tightening monetary policy, other countries suffer. Depending on just how much the FOMC decides to tighten at a future meeting, we foresee negative effects on world GDP in the medium term, not only for emerging markets but also for industrialized economies.
Using information released by the Fed in March, we have constructed two scenarios: “lift-off” is based on the maximum projected interest rates, while “delayed lift-off” is based on the minimum.
MANILA – The possibility that the US Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade sent jitters across emerging markets for weeks.
For starters, countries should embrace policies that favor foreign direct investment (FDI) over inflows that can be withdrawn more quickly, such as foreign bank loans, debt, or equity investments.
Third, domestic macroprudential and microprudential policies increase resilience.
ISLAMABAD – Relations between the United States and Pakistan have continued to fray since a US Special Forces team killed Osama bin Laden in a comfortable villa near a major Pakistani military academy.
For more than a decade, Pakistan and the US were close allies.
To do that, Pakistan would need help from some of the Afghan Pashtun tribes with which it had developed strong relations during the war against the Soviet Union.
On the other hand, the Chinese have been invited to develop Gwadar port on the Balochistan coast, and to use it as a base for their fast-expanding navy.
Income measured in PPP helps to avoid this problem.
One of them is agriculture-based, and people consume only food, while the other is industry-based, and people not only consume food but also buy clothes.
When it comes to the comparison of purchasing power in the international market, a more sensible question is: how many goods can a Chinese buy in the US using the income he earns in China?
By almost all recent estimates, China has little time to prepare.
Likewise, France’s economic growth is waning not because France has failed to undertake necessary structural reforms, but because European interest rates are too high.
But Berlin would not like a No vote.
A French No would sit well with the Union’s newer members from Eastern Europe, who know Chirac is not their friend, and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mischief.
“The EU is on autopilot, in stalemate, in deep crisis,” claims Joschka Fischer, the former German foreign minister and an important voice in Europe.
On the contrary, the quick international acceptance of the euro as one of the world’s premier currencies, aided by the European Central Bank’s determination to keep inflation under control, indicates that the monetary project is going full steam ahead.
Moreover, with the disappearance of the Soviet Union as a common threat, Europe’s left-wing parties are increasingly defining themselves as anti-American.
The world is in deepening crisis.
The first is the incoherence of American leadership.
This is obviously affordable, and is modest compared to military spending, but is far above the pittance that the G-8 actually brings to the table to solve these urgent challenges. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has made a valiant effort to get the rest of Europe to honor the modest aid pledges made at the G-8 Summit in 2005, but it has been a tough fight, and one that hasn’t been won.
They should agree to address shared global goals, including the fight against poverty, hunger, and disease (the Millennium Development Goals), as well as climate change and environmental destruction.
Time is short, since global problems are mounting rapidly.
Addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, which in turn involves choices in technology, some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed.
Similarly, it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal-fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide. 
And the US will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low-density population sites – such as the southwestern deserts for solar power and the northern plains for wind power – to the high-density populations of the coasts.
Of course, part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low-emission technologies, so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right.
Islam, many say, is a threat to democracy. The West is said to be “at war with Islam,” to quote the Somali-born activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
Whatever drives the extremism of Osama bin Laden, he would not have found so many willing recruits for his acts of mass murder if the regimes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or Algeria had been less oppressive and corrupt.
But this does not mean that political parties whose programs are based on religious faith cannot be democratic.
Such an outcome remains possible, especially if the rebellions fail and more oppression follows.
But the vicious civil war that followed – and has still not entirely concluded – caused the violent deaths of up to 200,000 people.
Is the whole investment world on Prozac?
George Soros once made a billion dollars off the Bank of England in just an hour.
Yes, the big Asian central banks do sit on almost $3 trillion in assets; China’s central bank alone has around a trillion dollars.
Moreover, financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before, placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it.
Which Globalization Will Survive?
Europeans carried diseases to the Americas in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that destroyed up to 95% of the indigenous population.
The effects will include stronger storms, hurricanes, and floods, deeper droughts, and more landslides.
Today, Al Qaeda and other transnational actors have formed global networks of operatives, challenging conventional approaches to national defense through what has been called “asymmetrical warfare.”
Modern technology means that pathogens travel more easily than in earlier periods.
It is thus unlikely that the Grand Coalition will adopt a different political approach towards Turkey than the previous Red-Green government.
Nationalist Turks, on the other hand, regard joining the EU mainly as a confirmation of national power and view all criticism of the country as a violation of Turks’ collective honor.
Many “old” Europeans, including Germany after Schröder’s resignation and France under a weakened Jacques Chirac, share that stance.
When Turkey's parliament voted in March 2003 against allowing American troops to open a northern front against Iraq, Turkey's traditional strategic partnership with the United States ended.
So the authorities responded quickly to the Bush administration's request for Turkish troops to join the coalition, although the idea was stillborn - rejected by both the Kurds and the American-appointed Governing Council in Iraq.
These steps led to the European Commission's recent recommendation to begin accession negotiations with Turkey.
Furthermore, Turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in Kurdistan between the two largest Kurdish factions.
NEW YORK – Sex crime has a telltale signature, even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States.
Looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture, it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this.
All this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person, but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders.
Whither Africa’s “Frontier Markets”?
Every year, Africans living outside the continent send roughly $30 billion to family and friends back home.
While Yar’Adua could use the goodwill that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger margin, the 90-day election campaign would almost certainly trigger civil unrest, and Nigeria’s leadership would be too busy navigating domestic political rivalries to help stabilize conflicts elsewhere in Africa.
The resulting political firestorm may well force Zuma to rely on core support from key allies within the country’s trade union movement and Communist Party, challenging the political elite’s pro-market consensus and provoking debate over the future of South Africa’s economic policy.
The United States’ economy is gradually reviving, albeit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession.
In the second scenario, a two- or three-tiered Europe includes a two-tiered euro, with the weaker countries using a separate “euro-B” currency that can float against the stronger economies’ “euro-A.”
Legal chaos would result.
European banks are far more thinly capitalized, and account for a much larger share of credit extended, than banks in the US, where much more lending originates in capital markets.
LAHORE – Pakistan remains the world’s never-ending question.
The economy is in shambles, and unable to meet the International Monetary Fund demands for its continued support.
The political system also remains unsettled.
Will the economy collapse if the IMF withdraws its support? Will the US increase its pressure by intervening militarily if Pakistan continues to harbor Taliban fighters operating from the tribal areas?
Whither Tunisia’s “Jasmine Revolution”?
This time, however, the report is less clear, less reassuring. Who were the protesters?
The protesters are holding Tunisian flags or signs bearing various symbols and slogans rejecting Ben Ali and the authoritarianism he represented in his late years.
That does not bode well for a domino effect, as no other Arab country has either a strong middle class or a tradition of modern, secular government.
Nevertheless, the new government has expressed a solemn commitment to freedom of information and assembly, the release of all political prisoners, and free and internationally supervised presidential and legislative elections within six months.
But the West (and Europe in particular) will finally have to take Turkey seriously as a partner – and stop viewing it as a Western client state.
The eastern Mediterranean, the Aegean, the western Balkans, the Caspian region and the southern Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East are all areas where the West will achieve nothing or very little without Turkey’s support.
Turkey’s “no” to new sanctions against Iran in all likelihood will prove to be a significant error, unless Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan can deliver a real turnaround in Iran’s nuclear policy.
Meanwhile, news reports indicate that high-end shopping malls in India and China are increasingly empty.
The number of rich households amounts to barely 0.7 million in India and one million in Brazil.
He estimates that 18% of the world’s middle class lived in North America in 2009, while another 36% lived in Europe.
The median Russian will be even older, at 43.3 years.
By contrast, the extended family is giving way in India to nuclear families, which now account for 64% of households.
All societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure.
They tend to be the most despotic and corrupt, not because poor people care less about good governance – on the contrary, their very lives depend on it – but because they lack the means to keep their government disciplined and law abiding.
For example, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam.
The natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power.
Who is to blame for this situation getting so out of control, and what is likely to happen next?
And its export lobby is fighting fiercely to keep the exchange rate roughly where it is relative to the dollar.
As a result, emerging-market countries, aiming to ensure that they avoidneeding financial support from the IMF in the foreseeable future, are increasingly following China’s lead and trying to ensure that they, too, run current-account surpluses.
But, honestly, the US has been overconsuming – living far beyond its means – for the past decade.
The “currency wars” themselves are merely a skirmish.
The elder Assad’s approach was, if anything, more brutal than his son’s, as the survivors of his 1982 siege of the town of Hama, aimed at quelling an uprising by Syria’s Muslim Brotherhood, can attest.
To be sure, the Assad regime bears most of the blame for Syria’s current situation. But, in the absence of any meaningful political process, it would appear that external demands for regime change back in 2011 – which amounted to a choice between Assad and extremist Sunni terrorist organizations – were not entirely thought through, to say the least.
As a senior member of Blair’s government throughout its tenure, he shares responsibility for everything that Blair has done.
First, inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale.
This “closeness” has led the police to investigate claims that some Labour Party donors have been rewarded with political honors.
With hindsight, it is clear that Britain’s participation in the Iraq war was driven solely by Blair’s determination to stick limpet-like to the US.
Others have suggested that the 26-year-old Tamerlan, an ethnic Chechen, may have witnessed the Russian/Chechen war of 1999, or Russia’s brutal efforts to pacify insurgent fighting in the North Caucasus.
In her view, Tamerlan’s radicalization was made in America.
Indeed, so rapid was the vilification of Chechens that the Czech Republic’s ambassador to the US felt compelled to issue a statement aimed at preventing any confusion among Americans about his country’s involvement.
For years afterward, the US was held out as an exception – a country in which young men, whatever their background, felt truly at home.
Governments are now vulnerable, and politicians are under attack almost everywhere.
Today the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establishment.
In fact, developments or fashions in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valuations of complex and inherently unfathomable securities.
It was playful, allusive, and edgy – in short, post-modern.
So let’s remind ourselves how compelling the logic of the financial innovation that led us to our current predicament seemed not too long ago. 
The crisis that engulfed financial markets in recent months has buried Wall Street and humbled the United States.
Isn’t this the crux of the matter?
Perhaps it is futile to look for the single cause without which the financial system would not have blown up in our faces.
Who Lost Europe?
The reasoning seems to be that growth requires market confidence, which in turn requires fiscal retrenchment.
Even though its fiscal and external accounts are strong, Germany has resisted calls for boosting its domestic demand further.
But eurozone membership deprives these countries of this powerful tool, and depreciation of the euro itself is of limited benefit since so much of their trade (around 50%) is with Germany and other eurozone members.
Germany’s leaders may take comfort in lecturing other governments about their profligacy.
If Turkey has indeed been “lost,” those responsible include the European Union, the United States, Israel, and Turkey itself.
To do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian, Muslim, and Middle Eastern historical trajectory.
Israel is not in the European Union, but it, too, is in great danger of losing Turkey.
But what about the humanities – all those disciplines (literature, history, languages, and so forth) whose relevance to economic competitiveness is not so obvious?
What was originally called the “liberal arts” provided the skills necessary for this transformation.
What is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring.
But the enrichment provided by the humanities was no less enduring, though its subtler nature makes it harder to track.
The key point here is that Europe won’t be able to upgrade the job later.
This was among the problems that the EU’s controversial Lisbon treaty was designed to fix.
The second is the politics of detail, where the new foreign policy chief’s role is to create a single EU stance on the wide range of issues about which European governments still have wildly different national positions.
Who Owns Bolivia?
Genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people, he recognized that Bolivia needs foreigners’ expertise to achieve growth, and that this entails paying fairly for their services.
(Bolivia may, of course, not want to bear the risk of a fall in the price, so it may strike a deal to transfer some of the downside risk to foreign companies, giving them in exchange more of the upside potential.)
The problem in Bolivia is a lack of transparency, both when contracts are signed and afterwards.
The new method spread: chickens disappeared from fields into long, windowless sheds. Factory farming was born.
When this grain, which humans could eat directly, is fed to chickens, they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat.
Supporters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free-range flocks, or by wild ducks and other migrating birds, who may join the free-range birds to feed with them or drop their feces while flying overhead.
Factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods.
In the 1980s, Japan was widely regarded as on the verge of overtaking the US; today, after more than two decades of Japanese stagnation, no one would take this scenario seriously.
One hopes that the Indian government will heed Subramanian’s account of how China grew through exports of manufactured goods and associated productivity improvements.
The bigger issue is China’s exchange-rate policy.
For example, the US built the world’s trading and monetary system 70 years ago, but now Republicans in Congress refuse to support change at the IMF – including sensible reforms that almost all other countries favor.
But that does not make its news reporting untruthful.
Along that tortuous route, the world's major powers are bound to be offended, probably quite regularly.
Its leading journalists are Western-trained, many having worked for years at the BBC.
If American, British, and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world, they must support reform-minded Arab individuals and organizations, even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times.
In each case, the city has managed to protect itself from such large sea-level rises and thrive.
Not according to Nicholls, Tol, and Vafeidis.
Not only do we have this capacity, but we have demonstrated it many times in the past.
This may explain recent polling data showing that public concern about global warming has declined precipitously in the last three years.
Today, however, with Asia’s giants, India and China, joining the global economy, prices for oil, gold, wheat, and virtually every other commodity are exploding.
In the late 1800’s, oil extraction involved dredging with a mule. Today, no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor.
They do not share the political evangelism of the Americans, who don’t just want to trade with commodity exporters, but to convert them as well.
But it is not immediately obvious whether it is Schroeder licking Putin’s boots nowadays or vice versa.
It is highly instructive to read the recommendations of these people and groups, as they unobtrusively render the objectives of their Kremlin clients into a language familiar to American leaders.
His recipe? Western countries should write off half a trillion dollars’ worth of debt owed to them by the Russian state corporations run by his pals from the Dresden KGB and the Ozero dacha cooperative.
It’s just that not all customers have the same motives.
After the government’s infusion of funds in September 2008, AIG’s losses continued to mount, so the government provided substantial amounts of additional capital two months later.
Without necessarily affecting the operations of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, the reorganization process would have simply shifted ownership of AIG’s assets from AIG’s existing shareholders to AIG’s creditors.
In the future, governments should not bail out failing financial institutions’ derivative counterparties, even when they provide a safety net to some of these institutions’ creditors (such as depositors).
It has rethought its traditional opposition to capital controls.
Sarkozy’s popularity is hitting new lows, and Strauss-Kahn’s friends say that he has never made a secret of his political ambitions.
The obvious choice is Asia, home to the most dynamic emerging markets.
समलैंगिक पुरुषों को जोखिम-पूर्व रोग-निवारण (PrEP) के लिए तैयार करना

एचआईवी के खिलाफ लड़ाई का दस वर्ष से अधिक का अनुभव रखनेवाला एक अफ्रीकी कार्यकर्ता होने के कारण, मुझे उम्मीद है कि डब्ल्यूएचओ जोखिम-पूर्व रोग-निवारण (PrEP) के उपयोग की सलाह देने के अपने पहले महत्वपूर्ण कदम से आगे बढ़ेगा। इसका मतलब है नाइजीरिया, युगांडा, गाम्बिया, और रूस जैसे देशों के साथ एचआईवी के खिलाफ लड़ाई में शामिल किए जाने के महत्व पर एक सार्वजनिक वार्तालाप की शुरुआत की जानी चाहिए।
But agreement about the regulatory role of central banks is not widely spread.
Under the new law, Snow would have been in charge of the stability of the entire US economy.
The same problems occur in many other countries.
Who Wants Cold War II?
In its quest to counter what it sees as a hostile US strategy of creating American “Cubas” on its doorstep, the Kremlin is promoting alliances with Raúl Castro’s Cuba and Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela.
But, as a power burdened with too many domestic ills and a chronic sense of insecurity along its vast and dangerously depopulated borders, Russia cannot be interested in a Cold War II, either.
Israel still refuses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because Hamas is part of that government.
We have nothing against Hamas; we are against their belligerent policies, which service in government has not changed.
Nobody in Israel will accept this.
The issue is not one of restoring nuclear “balance” to the Middle East, as Iran’s leaders maintain.
But we cannot reach that goal alone, much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel.
In particular, Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership.
On this dimension, the US seems destined to repeat the mistake of the British.
Similarly, it remains unclear that the Chinese development path will remain smooth.
China might well step in to fill that vacuum, but that is quite different from being able to elbow America aside.
In the Western world, the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation.
In a world of increasing complexity, perhaps what is needed are simple solutions.
But, when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice, perhaps “global deculturation” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions.
A few weeks of rain in Australia has emboldened those who think that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by the United Nations or conspiring scientists or maybe men from Mars.
We need Bill Clinton’s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals.
They want less government, lower taxes, and a smaller deficit, a combination to be achieved seemingly without pain.
But the fiasco in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games showcased some of India’s problems, not least deep corruption and inadequate infrastructure.
But who, exactly, is responsible for the rescue operation?
China’s standard response to any suggestion that it exercise global leadership is to hide beneath its vast internal agenda and plead poverty.
Yet emissions are not just rising, but accelerating.
This is hardly surprising.
Whether countries abide by agreements has far more to do with international processes of persuasion, socialization, and capacity-building – and those can be done by anyone with a good argument.
The rise of former President Hosni Mubarak’s last prime minister, General Ahmad Shafiq, who will enter the presidential runoff alongside the Muslim Brothers (MB) candidate Mohamed Morsi, has raised eyebrows across the political spectrum.
And Shafiq received financing and support from Mubarak’s National Democratic Party (NDP), as well as from business and security interests that benefited from the status quo.
If anything, the first-round results revealed the power of the non-Islamist revolutionary bloc, as well as Egyptians’ willingness to punish Islamists for their weak job performance in the parliament.
Moreover, the MB will most likely have to offer some concessions to guarantee balanced representation of Islamists and non-Islamists in the assembly that the parliament is to choose to draft a new constitution.
The latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation (and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host-country regulations).
This is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee – both the subject of lawsuits in recent years.
Such CSR builds the firm’s image as a “good” corporation, just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as “good” billionaires.
In this case, the choice of CSR spending is focused directly on generating added revenue, much like advertising, and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is.
With popular dissent growing and opposition forces strengthening, the authorities have sought to controll non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and strengthen the security forces.
Thus, those of us who value Georgia’s historical ties with Russia are called, at best, “archaists,” and at worst “enemies of Georgian independence,” as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power.
Regardless of what the Saakashvili government claims about his opponents, our political orientation is not pro-Russian, but pro-Georgian.
Whose War on Terror?
Many Muslims understand – as well as anyone in the West, and in the same terms – the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence. They know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations. Only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies.
Almost from the moment of Saddam’s fall, Saudi/Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded.
NOTTINGHAM – North Korea’s third nuclear test is a game changer not only for the United States and Japan, but also for the regime’s last ally, China.
Indeed, China should make clear that, much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper, it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode.
The US will remain committed to de-nuclearizing the peninsula, while the Korean government will be tempted to retain the North’s nuclear capabilities.
Europe’s Path to Disunity
These advantages include the right to move freely across borders, the free movement of goods and services, legal certainty for cross-border economic activities, Europe-wide transportation infrastructure, and, not least, common security arrangements.
The decisions taken by the European Central Bank are a particularly dramatic example of this problem, taken as they are by a simple majority of a body that is not even democratically elected.
The path toward a union based on joint liabilities, against the wishes of large parts of its population, is not leading to a federal state in the true sense of the term –&#160;that is, to an alliance of equals, who freely decide to unite and promise to protect each other.
And, despite having left the church, I still feel a profound reverence for the holy truth.
Investigative journalism and serious commentary, like religion, do not have a profit model.
In our market-driven times, we tend to think about the price of everything and the value of nothing, as Oscar Wilde put it.
And, finally, there is Project Syndicate itself (which publishes this column).

One reason, of course, is that the financial system takes time to heal – and thus for credit to begin flowing properly again. Pumping vast taxpayer funds into financial behemoths does not solve the deeper problem of deflating an overleveraged society.
Deferred maintenance on income equality is one of many imbalances that built up in the US economy during the pre-crisis boom.
All in all, the G-20’s policy of aiming for gradual stabilization of growth in government debt, bringing it into line with national-income growth by 2016, seems a reasonable approach to balancing short-term stimulus against longer-term financial risks, even at the cost of lingering unemployment.
President George W. Bush is endangering the United States and the world's safety while undermining American values.
In fact, Bush played right into the hands of Osama bin Laden.
Nor was the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison the work of a few bad apples.
It is a war of choice, not necessity.
The Bush administration's flip-flops and missteps are legion.
North Korea, Iran, Pakistan, and other countries pursue nuclear programs with renewed vigor.
A moment's reflection should raise another question: does Bush's Texas swagger qualify him to remain America's Commander-in-Chief?
In 2012, the aggregate fiscal deficit in the eurozone is expected to be slightly above 3% of GDP, compared to more than 8% in the US.
As early as the second half of 2009 – that is, before bond markets got nervous – policymakers’ top priority was to find the exit from fiscal stimulus.
As in continental Europe, productivity has suffered from a combination of insufficient profitability and dysfunctional capital markets.
Calling Off America’s Bombs
Neighboring Turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground, giving sanctuary to rebel forces along its border with Syria.
The US government’s misguided move from potential mediator and problem solver to active backer of the Syrian insurrection was, predictably, a terrible mistake.
The Russians openly backed Annan’s peace initiative.
To put it simply, President Barack Obama’s administration has inherited the neoconservative philosophy of regime change in the Middle East.
More broadly, the US should stop using countries like Syria as proxies against Iran.
Living with tyranny might be less life-threatening than embracing anarchy.
It is not as if maintaining its $1.3 billion in annual military aid gives the US any leverage over Egypt’s behavior.
And there was the 2008 agreement to trade nuclear material and technology with India, despite its unwillingness to accept serious new disarmament or non-proliferation commitments.
No state that aspires to win the support or cooperation of others can afford to be seen to be comfortable with unambiguous double standards.
How can this be? After all, power and influence are built on the back of economic success.
Moreover, in remaining preeminent, America requires other key states and regional groupings, such as ASEAN, to acquiesce in its security relationships.
Indeed, China’s strategists are frequently puzzled by the lack of “balancing” that takes place against the US in the region.
False triumphalism breeds poor discipline.
Its effects on risk-taking are debatable.
One might expect that after a dangerous crisis rooted in growing structural imbalances and an unsustainable growth pattern on the demand side, there would be serious, ongoing debate about what is needed to restore long-term growth and productive job creation in the context of a rapidly evolving global economy.
Many countries, including developing ones, will adopt defensive postures, some of which, such as making better use of the domestic market as a driver of growth, will have broadly positive impacts, even if growth prospects are somewhat diminished in the aggregate.
While a relatively high and sustainable growth pattern can be achieved, it will take time.
Second, I described how emerging data could suggest measurement problems with the conventional wisdom that more rapid trading in financial markets is making them more oriented to the short term than ever before.
So the company has wisely left its cash invested in global financial accounts, not business operations.
Apple has been one of those companies.
Could the rollout last fall of the inferior Apple Maps, which sent people to the wrong destination – causing severe public embarrassment and leading to a managerial shakeup – foreshadow a time when Apple’s best days are behind it? The company could be at a high plateau and could stay there for years, even decades, but does it really need $137 billion in cash for new investments?
Credit easing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse.
For that price, American taxpayers will get an extra $1 trillion of goods and services, and employment will be higher by about ten million job-years.
They are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new homebuyers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid-2000’s, or of the princes of Silicon Valley to spend more building new companies during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990’s.
What the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt, but that it has too much private debt, which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive.
What accounts for the apparent lack of effective policy action across a broad range of countries and regions?
Economic deleveraging takes time.
Others support constrained government on the grounds that it protects everyone from waste, rent-seeking, and interference with freedom of choice, and that, when needed, inspired leadership can build the required consensus to address changing circumstances.
This brings us to a crucial obstacle: Government, business, financial, and academic elites are not trusted.
Bernanke’s original speech emphasized several factors – some that decreased the demand for global savings, and some that increased supply.
A lot has changed since 2005.
Witness, for example, the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or decelerating.
Similarly, the integration of emerging-market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor.
In 1988, the household savings rate in China and the United States was roughly equal, at about 5%.
When interest rates decline, borrowers are able to borrow more.
In fact, there was a remarkable contrast in savings behavior across age groups in China and the US in the period 1992-2009.
Austerity and Demoralization
John Maynard Keynes, in his 1930 essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” speculated that, within a hundred years, that is, by 2030, higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours, for a total workweek of only 15 hours.
Work-sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump, thereby preserving their self-esteem.
In his book Why Wages Don’t Fall During a Recession, Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage-setting and layoffs.
And for that we need fiscal stimulus – ideally, the debt-friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally.
Instead, GDP has collapsed, with the Spanish and Italian economies expected to contract by close to 2% this year.
For example, according to official estimates, Spain’s public debt, which amounted to only about 36% of GDP when the crisis began, has almost tripled – and the actual figure may be much higher.
Investors’ subsequent efforts to price in the risk of a eurozone breakup – not the volume of sovereign debt – caused bond yields to spike.
The long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates’ positions, style, and personal qualities.
And Barack Obama has it.
By starting to draw down combat troops in Iraq, Obama would change the image and policies of America immediately.
Here again, the contrasting styles of Obama and McCain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one, between a major change in the nation’s direction and a minor one, between a conciliatory style and a more combative one.
The explanation of why the obvious lessons of the crisis are being not drawn lies in the curious character of financial activity.
Banks got much bigger very quickly, and bigness brought problems.
China can handle its large banks, even if they have large portfolios of poor credits.
By contrast, in the US, the government pushed big banks into buying up smaller and vulnerable banks, and is now doing everything it can to press them to lend more.
George W. Bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him. He then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times, egged on by his vice-president, Dick Cheney.
When they are plainly wrong, why let them off the hook? Here we have had Republicans criticizing an increase in America’s budget deficit after doubling America’s national debt in the Bush presidency’s eight years.
They are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism, if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone.
Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech, take seriously the views of his critics, and defend their right to disagree with him.
Indeed, can central bankers be truly independent? Unquestioning acceptance of a greater government role in taming markets would, in short, give way to asking whether that role can sometimes be part of the problem.
To enforce the statute, regulators periodically examine banks for CRA compliance.
The authors speculate that easier loan securitization may have made risky CRA-compliant loans seem less costly.
Studies like this one are useful in setting the record straight.
The Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with Mexico. And on a Sunday morning talk show, another Republican candidate, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, described building a wall on the US-Canada border as “a legitimate issue for us to look at.”
The US employs more than 20,000 Border Patrol agents; but even if they were all on duty at the same time, each would need to guard a 1,700-foot section of the border.
Football Fury
Have millions of Brazilians suddenly lost their passion for the game?
Football teams are now like multinational franchises, with coaches and players from all over the world.
It was striking to see how often the most prosperous-looking representatives came from the world’s poorest countries.
On the contrary, by protesting against the grotesque manipulation of the modern game, they are trying to take it back.
For investors, that outcome justified the creation of the catchy acronym.
And both have worked to thwart efforts by India, Brazil, and South Africa to become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
Unless it improves its infrastructure and literacy rate (particularly for women), India is unlikely to catch up with China.
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – China’s current economic slowdown has no shortage of causes: Europe’s financial turmoil, sputtering recovery in the United States, and weak domestic investment growth, to name the most commonly cited factors.
But there is another explanation for China’s excessive export dependence, one that has more to do with the country’s poor political and economic institutions.
Unfortunately, as China has already claimed a large share of the world’s merchandise exports (10.4% in 2010) and economic stagnation in the West is constraining external demand, this strategy can no longer work.
So in a sense, the Chinese bubble – as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one – has burst.
As the IMF noted, China’s growth rate has been declining steadily for five years – from 10.6% in 2010 to a projected rate of 6.8% this year and 6.3% in 2016.
Many Western analysts, especially in financial institutions, treat China’s official GDP growth of around 7% as a political fabrication – and the IMF’s latest confirmation of its 6.8% estimate is unlikely to convince them.
In mid-September, for example, when the private-sector Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) came out at 47.0, the result was generally reported along these lines: “The index has now indicated contraction in the [manufacturing] sector for seven consecutive months.”
This suggests that the government’s policy of shifting gradually to a market-based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed; even the measures to support the stock market now look less futile than they did in July.
Some observers, including those most fearful of a trade war, will be relieved.
In fact, both sets of critics have it wrong.
And if its exports grow more rapidly, they can allow the renminbi to rise.
But, as investment now rises relative to saving, there is a danger that the US current-account deficit, which fell from 6% of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5% of GDP last year, will widen again.
While the previous round of housing-sector restrictions, implemented less than two years ago, dampened market sentiment temporarily, it failed to curb rising property prices.
In order to curb this trend, policymakers have reverted to the quota as a macroeconomic tool, but this time for housing credit.
But China has attained much higher GDP growth than the OECD economies, driven largely by the rapid productivity gains that characterize the initial “catch up” phase of emerging-market development.
To manage exorbitant demand for financial and physical assets, China’s leaders must address its root cause: the low cost of capital.
To compare, M2 in the United States amounts to only roughly 63% of GDP.
Indeed, the rapid expansion of bank credit needed to finance skyrocketing government-led investment is increasing the amount of liquidity in China’s financial system.
China’s low official government debt largely reflects the role of currency in assuming quasi-fiscal liabilities – not only the write-off costs incurred from reforming state-owned banks, but also the takeover of banks’ bad debts via note financing and the purchase of asset-management companies’ bonds.
By 2010, close to 100 ozone-depleting substances, including CFCs, will have been phased-out globally.
Meanwhile, many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health, agriculture, and the planet’s multi-trillion dollar ecosystems, including forests.
WASHINGTON – In most advanced democracies, a large center-right party competes with a large center-left party.
In some countries, the “Greens” have their own identity, close to the left; but, despite remarkable progress in Germany, they remain unable to reach the electoral size of the large center-right and center-left parties.
As income inequality has increased – dramatically in some countries, such as the US – it is moving to the forefront of the debate, reinforcing the traditional political divide.
Such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream, while facilitating alternation in power, which is essential to any democracy’s dynamism; a system in which a large centrist party remained permanently in power would be far less desirable.
China, in turn, is a major market for final products, intermediate goods (including those used to produce finished exports), and commodities.
In particular, although China’s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies, the government is likely to accept some short-run slowdown, rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures.
Moreover, overall economic performance in Brazil masks an important fact: growth rates have been substantially higher among the country’s poorer citizens, and unemployment is declining.
Most of the downside risk to this scenario lies in the systemically important economies of Europe, the US, and China.
Power has also shifted in the global political arena, with the global financial crisis catalysing the emergence of the G-20.
These countries are able to choose a different technological path to growth, one based on low-carbon strategies and green principles.
Tax havens make economic crime more profitable, and the only way to fight them is to adopt global agreements on transparency in financial transfers, which should also cover companies on a country-to-country basis.
It is not true that we academics did not have useful models to explain what happened.
But hindsight distorts analysis.
Or it may be an explicit bias: an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear, or give testimony that is purely mercenary.
Yet, to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas – just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease.
Malala’s Revolution
Dawn, Pakistan’s largest-circulation English-language newspaper, reported that Hakimullah Mehsud, the Pakistani Taliban’s leader, had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad in response.
But, even with this growth rate, girls still accounted for just 44.3% of the total number of enrolled students in 2010.
She will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway.
Some 4.25 million are displaced internally, and more than 1.5 million have fled the country, sheltering as refugees mainly in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey.
Delivery problems abound in the war zones, but not everywhere.
But it remains the case that there are no obvious takers for a military role, partly because of the scale, difficulty, and risk of the commitment required, and partly because of the likely political and legal costs, given the minimal prospect of Security Council endorsement.
Painful concessions will be required from both sides if the Geneva conference is even to convene, let alone reach agreement on a cease-fire and transitional administration.
It is hard to find a US ambassador in any part of the world who has not embraced the challenge of mastering these communication technologies.
All fun stuff.
She did what any good – and, in her case, superb – diplomat should do: maintain relations with both sides and try to find a way forward.
Lo and behold, political leaders, especially tough and terrible ones like Assad, tend not to embrace a process whose stated purpose is to eliminate them.
But, in terms of growth and living standards, the cost of economic diversification, when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, eventually outweighs the benefits.
When the private and social returns of investment diminish too much, growth cannot be sustained indefinitely, even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while.
First, in one or several dimensions, some part of the economy’s base of tangible, intangible, and natural-resource assets is being run down.
Contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays, some degree of Keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period.
Not long before he died, Kuznets recommended to a young colleague that one ought study the role of Jews in economic life.
They pioneered new retail institutions, from department stores to box stores.
Jews were spread across many countries, but to some extent shared a common language and a sense of common fate.
Societies long oriented to economic dynamism tend to welcome the economically successful, viewing them as a source of mutual gains.
Indeed, the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well-known risk factors for illness and death, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, high blood glucose, and high cholesterol.
After all, the brain is just one organ of the body, so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others’.
As adults, they tend to have better diets, exercise more, gain less weight, have fewer hangovers, and so on.
Researchers have also searched for clues about the intelligence-mortality link in specific types of death.
The ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer.
Moreover, German politicians rarely heed the advice of German economists.
But the contraction will be primarily because of declining exports, a large portion of which consists of investment goods, as well as the drop in domestic equipment investment.
Germany should prepare its economic stimulus program now and implement it when the time comes.
After all, aside from political under-representation, Germany’s annual contribution to the EU budget (most recently €7.4 billion) makes the country by far the largest net contributor.
So his recent exercise in speculative future history, which asks whether economic growth in the United States has come to an end, has attracted much favorable attention.

Together, these companies invented mail order as the “killer app” of the railroad age, creating a continental market for consumer goods, with all of the economies of scale that followed.
Decades of frustration are now yielding to success: the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so-called Big Data that the Internet simultaneously generates and captures.
And here, too, Gordon disappoints.
The eurozone aspires to full economic integration, which entails the elimination of transaction costs that impede cross-border commerce and finance.
No one even keeps track of, say, Florida’s current-account deficit with the rest of the country, although we can safely guess that it is huge (since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere).
Even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance, there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so.
If European leaders want to maintain democracy, they must make a choice between political union and economic disintegration.
It must capture the imagination, address the public’s anxieties, and generate realistic hope.
Europe, in particular, needs a narrative of long-term hope that will trigger a real recovery.
It can secure decent jobs and prosperity, with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2%.
This implies two-tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries: the “euro-ins” and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger Europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values.
Rather, the problem is that the benefits of growth have failed to trickle down to disaffected youth.
So far those masses have little to complain about.
Thus, China needs to move quickly on education reform.
Recent migrants from the countryside and graduates with degrees from second-tier universities sorely lack such connections.
Yes, globalization represents a challenge to all EU member states; but it is not clear how more integration would help them to confront it.
Economists long ago recognized that it is theoretically possible that the emergence of new growth poles abroad does more harm than good to an economy.
Moreover, this relatively good trade performance has been achieved with a much lower increase in wage inequality in Europe than in the US.
The claim that Europe needs more integration to save its social model has long lost credibility.
Federal assumption of the states’ war debts also yielded an advantage in terms of economic development: once states no longer had any debt, they had no need to raise any revenues through direct taxation, which might have impeded the growth of America’s internal market. Indeed, after the federal government assumed the states’ debt (already a small part of the total), state revenues fell by 80-90%.
By contrast, growth prospects in Europe today are rather dim, and interest payments, even for Greece or Italy, account for less than 20% of total revenues.
The bailout request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states (represented by the Senate) and the population (represented by the House of Representatives) under the normal decision-making procedure (the “Community method,” in European Union jargon).
The policy’s scope is also widely misunderstood.
US leaders are well aware of the geopolitical factors that make Europe their most important and reliable ally.
To this end, the EU can leverage its position as a leading trading partner, investor, and aid donor; it can also contribute at leaders’ summits, such as the Asia-Europe Meeting and the ASEAN Regional Forum.
The crucial issue is the extent to which creditors will have to participate in rescue measures by accepting “haircuts” – that is, partial losses on their claims.
But haircuts in the case of a solvency crisis are indispensable for the stability of the European financial system itself.
This level of protection would induce them to invest their money only if the borrowing country offered a reasonable, limited interest-rate premium over safe assets.
This mechanism is not available in a monetary union such as the eurozone.
In the United States, businesses and labor unions use “fair trade” laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls “barbed-wire barriers to imports.”
By the end of 2007, more than 600 producers’ organizations, representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries, were selling fair-trade products.
This has raised farm producers’ income independently of the fair-trade movement’s efforts.
This is without considering the effect that FAIRTRADE has on the poorest people in these countries – not farmers but casual laborers – who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards.
Is US Monetary Policy Made in China?
In 2005, US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan pointed to the phenomenon as an explanation for his famous “conundrum”: interest rates on Treasury bonds were lower than market conditions appeared to warrant.
His estimates imply that foreign sales at a rate of $60 billion per month raise yields by ten basis points.
Why Finance Can Save the Planet
In 2011, “Unburnable Carbon,” a path-breaking report by the nongovernmental Carbon Tracker Initiative, showed that the proven fossil-fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exceed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees Celsius.
A second reason why finance matters is that the transition to a low-carbon economy requires huge investments.
But, because high fuel prices are unpopular with consumers and raise competitiveness concerns among businesses, governments are reluctant to take action today – and may renege on their commitments to act tomorrow.
There would be no procrastination.
So, should governments step back and let financial firms reform themselves?
As a result, even if corporate governance problems in financial firms are fully addressed, a government role in regulating their compensation structures may still be warranted.
In such a case, firms could still remain free to choose the number of shares and options awarded to any given manager, as well as to adjust somewhat the length of the post-vesting period during which cashing out would be precluded. 
Consider the facts.
Indeed, the figures have been repeatedly revised, even over quite short periods of time, casting strong doubt on the validity of the economic models being used.
This may be true when the economy is operating at full employment – when state and market are in competition for every last resource.
This implies that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit – reluctance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market.
These are trying times for French President François Hollande.
For Islamic fundamentalists, France is now the “Great Satan.”
While the French public agrees that Mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists, the way Afghanistan did in the late 1990’s, attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades.
For Hollande, war in Mali is both an opportunity and a risk.
It is no less significant for Hollande and France.
Moreover, the capabilities of the Malian army and those of other West African countries that are supposed to join the operation are too weak to turn the tide.
To be sure, Europe has the means for joint action.
Britain’s bilateral cooperation with France – highlighted during the Libyan crisis – is sometimes very strong.
Now, however, it recoils at any prospect of military intervention, even as it remains the world’s third-largest arms exporter.
Two striking statements on economic policy by France’s leaders in the first weeks of this year have highlighted the force of this logic.
Not surprisingly, the preference has been for transfers, which, until the 2008 financial crash, took the form of cross-border private-sector lending to governments and banks.
From this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity, because this would boost economic growth, in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run.
The specter of continuing economic stagnation and ever-rising unemployment (with the young and older workers being the worst hit) should remove the second, geopolitical obstacle to a French exit from the eurozone.
For example, Arvind Panagariya of Columbia University divided developing countries into two groups: “miracle” countries that had annual per capita GDP growth rates of 3% or higher, and “debacle” countries that had negative or zero growth rates.
He has also shown that many of the nineteenth century’s successful high-tariff countries, such as Canada and Argentina, used tariffs as a revenue source, not as a means of sheltering domestic manufacturers.
The opposite is true.
That refrain is followed by a chorus from the rest of the monetary union demanding to know why Germany is taking such an inflexible approach.
To be sure, even Germans know that rules sometimes need to be bent. Thinkers as far back as Aristotle have argued that rules fail when they are too rigid.
The default of 1945 was the consequence of losing World War II. Indeed, the tradition of so-called Ordoliberalism that has shaped Germany’s post-war economic policy was a response to the Nazis’ destructive arbitrariness.
ATHENS – The centrality of Germany to Europe and, more widely, to world affairs has been amply, and often bloodily, demonstrated over many centuries.
And yet, despite the risks, European leaders remain remarkably inactive, apparently reassured by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s promise to do “whatever it takes” to protect the monetary union from collapse. But prolonged inaction, induced by relative calm in financial markets, will perpetuate stagnation and eventually lead to a breakup of one sort or another.
Austerity should be eased, particularly in the fiscally stronger core economies, and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium-size firms in the over-indebted countries.
There is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982.
When the European Union was created, it was the embodiment of an open society – a voluntary association of equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good.
But the periphery is seething with discontent.
If the euro breaks up in disarray, the common market and the EU will be destroyed, leaving Europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began, owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility.
The same result could be achieved, with less cost to Germany, if Germany chose to behave as a benevolent hegemon.
But, whatever form the default takes, the current owners of Greek debt will get less than the full amount that they are now owed.
There simply is no way around the arithmetic implied by the scale of deficit reduction and the accompanying economic decline: Greece’s default on its debt is inevitable.
The substantial surge in the interest rate on Greek bonds relative to German bonds in the past few weeks shows that the market now regards such a default as increasingly likely.
Now, 15 months into the expansion, the level of real GDP is still lower than it was when the recession started.
When those price bubbles burst, households lost substantial wealth and financial markets became dysfunctional.
But it is worth remembering that the saving rate averaged 9% in the quarter-century from 1960 to 1985.
Now those projections have been cut to less than 2%, which is too slow to make a dent in the very high rate of unemployment.
“Reform” suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life, undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism, as an antidote to Mao Zedong’s ideology of “revolution.”
Little in China today speaks of moderation.
After all, Mao’s Cultural Revolution against “feudal society” did raze much of the cultural landscape, denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions, but also of failed socialist efforts, leaving China ready for the seeds of capitalist development.
The first wrong Chinese was Gao Xingjian, a critical playwright, artist, and novelist, who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000, while living in exile in Paris.
As the warm welcome given to Hillary Clinton on her recent swing through Asia – even in communist Vietnam – appears to show, Southeast Asians are more than happy to hang on to Pax Americana for a bit longer, out of fear of China.
Communist ideology is a spent force.
Democracy has not tempered South Korean chauvinism much, either, since the demise of the military dictatorship in the 1980’s.
The urban disturbances in France have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968.
The first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census – or by government agencies or public or private enterprises – on ethnicity, religion, and even social class.
France is now very bad at creating new jobs.
One study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants, those with an Islamic-sounding name, and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb, had only one-fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French-sounding name and a “safe” address.
Similar sentiments are all but universal among modern physicists.
You can write the equations of the core theories of physics – known as the standard model – quite comfortably on a T-shirt.
The answer likely lies within us.
Viewed from this perspective, the apparent beauty of the laws of physics – our attraction to their symmetry and exuberance – is not surprising.
Rather than recognizing the beauty of laws otherwise discovered, we use principles of beauty – vast symmetry and a high ratio of output to input – to enable discovery.
Virginia Woolf called the ideal of womanhood in this period “The Angel in the House”: a retiring, fragile creature who could not withstand the rigors of the public arena.
My alma mater, Yale, used anonymity in reporting of sex harassment and rape to sweep sex-crime incidents and repeat offenders’ records under the rug for two decades, thereby protecting its own interest in preventing systematic investigation.
And we have the myth of higher false reporting of rape relative to other crimes (in the US, the rate is no different: 2-4%).
It is no one’s business whom a victim has slept with previously, or what she was wearing when she was attacked.
The interest-rate spreads for Italian and Spanish government bonds have dropped dramatically, corporate-bond issues have resumed, and a sense of normalcy is slowly pervading the continent.
By the time the German Bundestag decided, it could be too late.
But why is Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, who is not an elected politician (and has promised not to run for election), so hesitant? Given that he does not have to fear electoral defeat, he could help Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy by filing first, which would weaken the political stigma for Rajoy’s government were it to file subsequently.
While Monti’s mandate was set to last until the election, he might be trying to extend it with the support of the new parliament.
Given that France overcame similar weaknesses and political deadlock with the creation of the Fifth Republic, which includes a robust executive led by a powerful president, the French model seems like an effective one to follow.
The right-wing RPR-UDF coalition did even better in 1993, when it won 38.5% of the vote in the first round but obtained an astonishing 82% of the seats.
At the end of the day, there is no institutional reform that could miraculously “save” Italy.
For example, when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases, it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities, because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations.
Lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished.
Saddled by a viral infection, drug-related insecurity, and rising crime, Mexico feels like a besieged place.
That is why home seems far, far away for so many Mexicans.
Against the backdrop of rapid globalization, the individual risks and costs of moving internationally will continue to fall.
Approximately 200 million people, around 3% of the world’s population, now live in countries in which they were not born.
As education levels rise, so do expectations about work.
Opening borders completely could produce gains as high as $39 trillion for the world economy over 25 years.
Occasional frustrations notwithstanding, it is, in fact, unlikely that the US will turn against a faithful – and dependent – ally, especially one whose leader enjoys cordial personal relations with Bush.
Obaidullah’s capture – carried out reluctantly – underscores the Pakistan military’s ambiguous relationship with the Taliban.
This is clear in Islamabad, where over the past two months, Kalashnikov-toting students have openly challenged the state, following a government order for the demolition of dozens of illegally built mosques and seminaries.
Hardline Islamists, favored previously, are now out, and soldiers charged with mutiny have received the death penalty.
It is unresolved because the scientific question has always been entangled with politics.
Society would be spending scarce resources on losers rather than winners.
The evolutionary story was now recast as a battle of genes to secure their survival over time by means of mutations, which create individuals (phenotypes) best adapted to pass on their genes.
Consideration for others is “located in the prefrontal cortex.”
Obama’s Rocky Path to Success in Syria
There simply was not enough hard evidence of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, at least before the Ghouta massacre in August, to pressure Russia – either in the United Nations Security Council or the court of global opinion – to reconsider its reflex support of the regime.
And the administration could have helped itself by better explaining that a cooperative response to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons had long been on the table, and was not just the result of deftly opportunistic Russian diplomacy in response to a Kerry thought-bubble.
And that outcome is not possible without Iran.
In December 2012, Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons, including sarin gas, being transferred to Syria.
America’s regional position weakened, and Iran’s strengthened, following the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq; US intervention in Syria could reproduce that pattern.
This, in turn, would strengthen the Russia-Iran alliance.
Obama has his “red line” on the use of chemical weapons. So does Khamenei.
If the market price rises above that figure, the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher.
Economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children, you can pay $10 for a pound of non-Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children.
Why Put Charles Taylor on Trial
Both our home government and friends in Sierra Leone agreed.
When we tried to escape, the rebels captured us.
They then cut off David's arms before setting him ablaze.
Russia’s conflict with the Islamic State, the argument goes, has aligned the country’s interests with those of the West.
Ordinary Russians may be in danger of attacks by Islamic extremists, but they pose little threat to Putin or his allies.
Putin’s Russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum, while the United States and Europe (despite the protests of civil libertarians) have chosen to occupy the other end.
Hard to be Easing
Moreover, fiscal support is absent this time: QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip, respectively, because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus.
Indeed, the bond-market channel is unlikely to boost growth.
Empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker US dollar on the trade balance is close to zero.
NEW HAVEN – The politicization of central banking continues unabated.
The reason is not hard to fathom.
Not only is QE’s ability to jumpstart crisis-torn, balance-sheet-constrained economies limited; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy.
Household debt stood at 112% of income in the third quarter of 2012 – down from record highs in 2006, but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75% norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century.
Where it goes, the next crisis is inevitably doomed to follow.
In fact, Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end.
Japan’s military thrust into Southeast Asia led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s administration to impose sanctions.
On December 1, it was decided that the war would commence in six days.
However, high-handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response, for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated, and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice.
Romney’s proposed contractionary policies –&nbsp;the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely, while the US economy is still frail –&nbsp;will almost surely weaken America’s already anemic growth, and, if the euro crisis worsens, it could bring on another recession.
Indeed, the model blew up even before Bush left office.
Consider, for example, the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier: climate change, financial regulation, and trade.
A stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the US from China to lower-cost producers of textiles, apparel, and other goods.
Of course, Scotland’s technocratic nationalism made sense.
In fact, the “no” campaign’s victory might have been even more resounding if the Westminster establishment’s desperate, last-minute offer to grant Scotland more powers on taxation, spending, and welfare had been included as an option in the ballot.
True, Scotland’s great minds in the age of Enlightenment, such as David Hume, Adam Smith, and even the national poet, Robert Burns, were all fervent advocates of “Britishness,” whatever that might mean today. Yet an identity-based campaign could have resorted to the heritage of the Scottish Renaissance of the mid-twentieth century or to the Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight movements, which awakened a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots in the late nineteenth century.
Long Live China’s Slowdown
That number has potentially huge implications, because it means that China could grow at an annual rate in the 7-8% range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction.
Yet services offer more than just a labor-intensive growth path.
Invariably, the middle-income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early-stage development models for too long.
Who will then fund America’s budget deficit – and on what terms?
How can this be?
John Maynard Keynes, however, had little time for this view.
The financial reaction to the collapse of a bubble and the resulting wave of bankruptcies drives the natural rate of interest below zero, even though there are still many ways to put people productively to work.
MILAN – Until recently, relatively little attention was paid to states’ balance sheets.
Of course, state ownership is not the only way to impede efficiency and dynamism.
States own land, mineral rights, and infrastructure.
Here is the dilemma: Governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act, but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism.
The alternative is a poor intergenerational burden-sharing choice.
In fact, those concerned about labor rights and the environment risked hurting their own cause.
The agreement includes substantial steps to enforce the prohibitions contained in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).
There was, of course, a danger that such protections for corporations could go too far.
In all these areas and more, traditional textbook arguments about the gains from trade apply: new export opportunities lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living.
In response, US President Barack Obama’s administration has been working through the United Nations Security Council to impose tougher economic sanctions.  Nonetheless, Iran edges toward mastering the process of enriching uranium to weapons-grade purity.
Accordingly, if tougher sanctions prove to be useful, they will do so by confronting Iran with a united diplomatic front, thereby encouraging its government to make a deal in order to end the country’s isolation.
In response to an attack, Iran might well seek to obstruct shipping in the Persian Gulf, potentially triggering oil shortages and soaring prices.
Dialogue with the US could focus on areas, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where the two parties share a measure of common ground.
Credit mistakes are made during the boom, not during the crash, so the argument goes.
Small failures can give birth to large panics, which means that in a crisis almost everyone is “too big to fail.”
Those that failed were relatively small, like IKB, Bear Sterns, and so on.
Let’s not forget the essays in central banks’ stability reports on how credit derivatives were benefiting the financial sector.
Europe’s Non-Deal of the Century
One of the most powerful arguments for the EADS-BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market, while also creating a powerful new defense industry.
Mario Draghi’s Opiate of the Markets
And they regard this outcome as the worst-case scenario, one that implies a delay of any further economic measures, deep policy uncertainty, and the risk of an even less favorable electoral outcome.
For this reason, triggering the OMT mechanism requires the unanimous consent of eurozone governments.
Even after Germany’s election, I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives – and even the composition – of Italy’s ruling coalition.
There are many reasons for these gyrations, but the expectation that the Fed will start to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as September – is clearly one of them.
Some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors, which have reduced the labor force, as well as to weak productivity levels, which have been low.
Estimates from Citigroup indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrupted in the coming decades.
The direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods.
If the Fed is seen as unleashing a major crisis in emerging markets, this will almost certainly do long-term damage to the global financial system.
And without structural reform, there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth – not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay.
Back in 2013, IMF staff wrote a sobering report on the organization’s experience in the country.
Breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers (as they do in much of southern Europe, including Italy and, to some extent, France) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers. Making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier.
In an ideal world, offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state.
These six international banks alone accounted for nearly 20% of the prime money-market funds’ value.
The proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money-market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value “float” – and not be rounded up – to reflect its true, underlying risk.
But the 2008 financial crisis showed that, when push comes to shove, the government will backstop money-market funds nonetheless.
So the mutual-fund industry had the regulators all to itself.
Given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self-sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms, America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi-polar international order.
The US and the EU (taken as a whole) are not only the world’s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies; they also maintain the world’s largest bilateral trade relationship.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement spearheaded by the US, is set to be a game-changer in the Asia-Pacific region, with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015.
But let’s not wait: faced with predictions of the West’s relative decline, the US and the EU must commit themselves to more union, more cooperation, and more prosperity.
At the same time, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has become a bastion of sensible thinking on financial-sector issues.
But what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time?
Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig’s The Bankers’ New Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it? will appear officially in March, but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks.
Whatever else happens in 2013, we can be sure that they will not win the Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award.
On the unification of Germany, he resisted the advice of Thatcher and others, apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Other critics complained that Bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding Russian democracy, the Middle East, or nuclear non-proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid.
He was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev, and to manage the transition to Boris Yeltsin’s presidency in a newly independent Russia.
The lesson is that in some circumstances, we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like George H. W. Bush (or Dwight Eisenhower before him), rather than by more flashy and inspirational transformers.
But, for several reasons, the Turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small-scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all-out war.
That’s hardball politics, not a declaration of war.
It can close the two countries’ principal border crossing, an important route for food, fuel, and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds.
Most supplies headed for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the Incirlik airbase in Turkey.
The outcome of this standoff could determine Ukraine’s future, as much as the military confrontation with Russia.
Russia’s intervention has to some extent backfired, strengthening support for a European orientation.
The energy monopoly Naftogaz, previously a cesspool of illicit transactions, has in a year managed the seemingly impossible: making Ukraine virtually independent from direct gas delivery from Russia for at least a year.
Infrastructure Minister Andriy Pivovarsky, also a former investment banker, was most recently CEO of Continium, one of the country’s largest holding companies.
The stakes could not be higher.
The US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves, but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth.
Indeed, almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of QE, more than 95%, are sitting in excess reserves, neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation.
The new Consumer Financial Protection Board is also a deterrent, as banks consider it safer to lend to the government, large corporations, and giant real-estate speculators.
It will take a clearly stated, widely understood strategy – the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979-1982 – to complete the job.
There are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial-market participants would rather forget.
Our national politicians, increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises, are suspected, often with good reason, of simply looking after their own interests.
In the Anglo-Saxon media world, Rupert Murdoch, owner of far too many newspapers, TV stations, and movie studios, is a typical populist tycoon.
A few years ago, a clown named Brozo, with a large red nose and a bright green wig, was Mexico’s most popular political commentator on television, actively courted by all candidates running for national office.
They are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views.
Their main interest is in their own business.
NEW YORK – The sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle.
Lifestyle changes, for example, have spurred increasing per capita water consumption, with rising incomes promoting dietary change, for example, especially higher consumption of meat, production of which is ten times more water-intensive, on average, than plant-based calories and proteins.
China, however, is not yet in the category of water-stressed states.
With the era of cheap, bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints, many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil.
But recently, a fifth element, information, has entered the debate.
Given that females bear the physical burden of offspring, an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous – and thus more common – in nature.
For example, those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier, more vibrant, and more attractive than those who do not.
But mimicry’s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz.
Such tools can be used to comprehend, for example, the difference between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and US President Barack Obama.
In “House of Cards,” the world is not as viewers believe it should be, but as they fear it is.
The series has become known not just for its massive budget or intricate storytelling, but also for its sustained choreography of brutal violence.
They relish the reminder that politics is just as ruthless in the US as it is at home.
Many of the links were obvious, but had been given insufficient attention.
The Bank’s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state, and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government.
Worse, the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance, an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies, thereby enervating their effectiveness.
He has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up.
Such arguments also ignore the fact that affluent working women and their partners overwhelmingly offload the work-family imbalance onto lower-income women – overwhelmingly women of color.
This solution was not framed as a “women’s issue,” but as a family benefit.
Reding invited corporations to sign up for gender balance goals of 40% female board membership.
After all, four decades of evidence has now shown that corporations in Europe as well as the US are evading the meritocratic hiring and promotion of women to top positions – no matter how much “soft pressure” is put upon them.
Indeed, the critics point out that the wide-ranging and comprehensive talks agreed to by the two sides are the old “composite dialogue” under a new label.
The transcendent reality of life on the subcontinent is that it has always been India that wished to live in peace.
And, should it prove necessary, dialogue can also be used to send a few tough signals.
NEW YORK – Long ago, I wrote about the Internet pioneer Julf Helsingius, who ran a precursor to WikiLeaks called anon.penet.fi.
He was opaque and playfully cryptic, already a little paranoid – perhaps justifiably so.
If institutions are not fully accountable, it is useful to have an unaccountable countervailing institution to reveal their secrets.
If the cure is to be worse than the disease, to quote Personal Democracy Forum co-founder Andrew Rasiej, let’s find a better cure: let’s make the proper distinction between what should be secret and what everyone knows.
Information – and specifically the Internet’s power to spread it – is our best defense against bad, unaccountable behavior.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange argues that the answer is no, and that greater transparency “creates a better society for all people.”
Avoiding embarrassment may at times be in the national interest, but it can also protect the careers of politicians and bureaucrats.
Perversely, it will lead to greater secrecy.
This model, within which individuals are subjects or, at best, taxpayers and voters, is being undermined by several recent trends that have empowered the individual.
Global finance has been one of the most eager beneficiaries of these trends, using Internet networks not just as a tool to conduct operations with greater efficiency and velocity, but also as a means to circumvent state supervision.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was jailed for circulating on the Internet his proposal for a truly democratic constitution, Charter 08, which gathered 10,000 signatures online in only 24 hours.
That storm will leave behind no trace of understanding if it is assessed in isolation, rather than as part of a broader pattern.
Contagion soon spread across East Asia, with the ripple effects of serial currency devaluations reaching as far as Russia and Brazil.
Since then, China has aggressively pursued a fast-growth, export, and investment heavy model of economic development.

Europe’s Unending Berlusconi Problem
But the overall picture remains fragile.
While the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition, many uncertainties could derail the reform process.
Will Cap-and-Trade Incite Protectionism?
That uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements, such as automobile mileage standards, production technology standards (e.g., minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation), etc.
When the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions, there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices. Such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products (being higher on more CO2-intensive products) and among countries (being higher for countries with low permit prices).
But as China’s leaders begin final preparations for the Games next August, they may be wondering if hosting the event was such a good idea after all.
Television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide Beijing with the signature Olympic image it had in mind, and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage.
China’s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes, but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics.
As China’s leaders scramble to address these challenges, will they still relish the idea of providing an international audience with front-row seats? How they look back on the Games once the confetti is swept from the streets is far from certain.
But China’s history of humiliation at the hands of European colonial powers has made its leaders ardent supporters of inviolable national rights and suspicious of any sacrifice of sovereignty.

Today, the country is a remarkable economic power: the world’s manufacturing workshop, its foremost financier, a leading investor across the globe from Africa to Latin America, and, increasingly, a major source of research and development.
All of which raises the question of whether China will eventually replace the US as the world’s hegemon, the global economy’s rule setter and enforcer.
Gone will be the evangelism of markets and democracy.
The trouble is that it will become increasingly difficult for China to maintain the kind of growth that it has experienced in recent years.
Will China’s Capitalist Revolution Turn Democratic
Nearly all the major institutional reforms, such as strengthening the legislature, holding village elections, and building a modern legal system, were launched in the 1980’s.
Having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co-opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders, the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base.
At the same time, selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily.
This imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity, analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity, when computers replace human intelligence.
Indeed, according to a computer crunching big data, this would be an optimal decision.
In this context, it is difficult not to think of China’s recent stock-market plunge.
These people influence markets, because all other investors must reckon with them; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon.
Optimists – fortunately, there remain a few, especially in Europe itself – believe that when the situation becomes really critical, political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth, job creation, and financial stability.
Left to its own devices, such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering, disruptive posturing, and disagreement over visions of the future.
For them, only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and, instead, catalyze the policy initiatives – greater fiscal, banking, and political union – that, together with monetary union, would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four-legged platform.
And global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves, shifting countries’ liabilities to taxpayers and the ECB’s balance sheet.
So the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety. It also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome.
Europe’s banking system remains sickly, even though many national governments have gone to great lengths to hide their banks’ woes.
It is just as important to ask what happens over the next five years as over the next six months, and the jury is still very much out on that.
If reform resumes, there is no reason why Europe should not enjoy a decade of per capita income growth at least as high as that of the US.
Portugal did so in 2001 and the Netherlands in 2003.
The reform proposals that are currently being debated are adventurous to say the least, because they all seem to center around the question of which government expenses should be exempt from the calculation of the deficit.
Europe is, moreover, the continent with the slowest rate of economic growth in the world.
Will Ex-Mexicans Choose America’s Next President?
The first American immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 – the so-called Gentleman’s Agreement with Japan, while the US and Mexico negotiated and administered the Bracero Program for more than twenty years, from 1942 thru 1964.
The electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation’s importance in today’s presidential campaigns.
The other, already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high-savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East.
But once American households rebuild their retirement accounts, they may return to their profligate ways.
They need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging Chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving.
One development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money-losing proposition.
Today, one might ask the same question about the global economy’s vulnerability to cyber-attack.
They say that the ability of cyber-terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink, as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4, is utterly fictional.
Third, with slowing growth in advanced economies, information technology seems to hold the moral high ground, just as finance did until five years ago.
If the world’s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses, what guarantee is there that something won’t go awry?
Over the past few decades, the International Monetary Fund became associated with excessive fiscal austerity, extreme political insensitivity, and – since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 – with an out-and-out stigma.
Greek trade unions know what this means – and are in the streets.
T he IMF was created in the waning days of World War II, essentially as a United States-West European partnership.
We can expect to hear all kinds of misleading excuses from EU sources for excluding the IMF: “the Fund is too American,” “Europe must resolve its own problems,” and “the IMF is not appropriate to our circumstances.”
The end game – for both Israel and Hamas – is thus crucially important.
With open borders, Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank, putting enormous pressure on Abbas, the leader of the rival Fatah movement, to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas.
Palestinians will recognize Hamas’s acceptance of a multi-year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat, which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment.
More importantly, Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war, sharing Palestinian suffering; many have been killed, along with their families.
The region’s economic stature was bolstered in 2003 with the advent of the Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline, a $4.2 billion project brokered by the World Bank that is expected to boost exploration and output in Chad and at offshore sites in Equatorial Guinea, while spreading the benefits more widely.
For this reason, the World Bank imposed stringent conditions on Chad and Cameroon.
This constitutes a powerful disincentive for Chad and Cameroon to act against company malfeasance or to defend individuals adversely affected by the project.
PARIS &#45;&#45; Few state visits have lasting results.
Sarkozy’s strategy is to link progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a redefinition of NATO.
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even tried to use divide-and-rule tactics by pitting “New” Europe against the “Old” Europe led by France and Germany, which opposed the Iraq war.
LONDON – When Mark Carney replaces Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England in July 2013, the world will be deprived of King’s witty public utterances.
Regulators have been wrestling with this problem for years, without conspicuous success.
They will also be required to maintain stronger capital and liquidity positions in the US.
He adds: “I wouldn’t call it a trade war, but I would certainly call it a high level of protectionism.”
“Be careful what you wish for” is wise advice in the regulatory world, as it is elsewhere.
The government’s incentives are clear.
In this cat-and-mouse game, risk takers have the upper hand.
For example, the US Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble, ultra-low interest rates will be maintained (at the expense of savers) until the sector recovers.
Finally, the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net.
For most Israelis, even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon’s legacy after the Gaza disengagement, Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister.
Halutz already resigned a few months ago.
Only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed.
What will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes?
Does that experience suggest that the NASDAQ index will drop sharply if the Fed raises interest rates on June 30?
If one borrows the equivalent of three years' income to buy a house, a mortgage rate of 6% means that 18% of one's income goes to interest payments, which may be tolerable.
Low interest rates did not cause the bubbles.
Of course, Russia partly belongs to this region.
Russians, on the other hand, emphasize their “hard power,” including military force, because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind.
Thus, the old mentality survived on both sides.
Without Russia, which will remain the world’s third strongest power for the foreseeable future, it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security.
I love this guy.”
Brazil’s current success is rooted not only in Lula’s two terms, which must end in 2010.
And Lula achieved all this without triggering inflation, which he knows – perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood – wreaks havoc on the poor most of all.
If Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path, it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures.
Meanwhile, the advanced economies are tentatively recovering from the 2008 crisis.
Second, emerging-market bears point out that these economies have gained major productivity benefits from the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas, a surplus that will soon be exhausted.
And coding-supported products often have lower costs per unit of output than even very cheap labor can provide.
In fact, it could be argued that new “leap-frogging” may become possible.
Turkey's formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights, including abolition of the death penalty, safeguards against torture, promotion of religious freedoms, gender equality, and restriction of the military's role in political life.
Moreover, for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions, and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU.
Many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture.
On balance, however, the advantages far outweigh the risks.
The main impediment to further progress is that two competing narratives have emerged to explain Europe’s economic travails and lay out a path forward.
While an integrated financial framework for Europe is taking shape, daunting decisions regarding the design of a European resolution mechanism need to be worked out.
Although politicians and voters are equally unwilling to admit it, the EU has reached a fork in the road.
American financial supremacy in the twenty-first century resembles Britain’s position in world finance a century ago.
Despite the dollar’s instant credibility, however, it took more than a decade for America’s currency to match Britain’s as an international medium of exchange. Payment habits melt at a glacier’s pace.
The European Central Bank, established in 1998, has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability.
A catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange.
The primary problem is that conditions in individual EMU members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be tempted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members.
Although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus, a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants.
But even if it is one of the smaller countries, it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end.
European officials’ incensed reaction – the banks are fine, they insist, and need only liquidity support – should serve to buttress the Fund’s determination to be sensible about Europe.
My own sarcastic reaction was to think, “Oh, now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk.”
That is why, for example, so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner.
Now that the Fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many European banks, it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis, a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform.
More than a decade after the fact, the Kremlin still decries NATO’s eastward enlargement as a security threat.
Yet this is not in the group interests of Putin’s backers, the people who run, and own, Russia: its security, military, and industrial complex.
The St. Petersburg Economic Forum is mostly for international consumption.
In his decade in power, Putin has consolidated and strengthened the security forces, intimidated and jailed opponents, and muzzled the media and courts.
Arab democracy, he claims, has now become a domestic concern in the United States, which will make it hard for American presidents to sweep the abuses of friendly Arab regimes under the rug, as they did in the past.
They have even inspired the birth of a new political party, Hizb al ghad (the Party of Tomorrow), founded by a young parliamentarian committed to democratic reform.
The NDP appears to believe that democratization must begin with changing the political culture and instilling democratic values.
City employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25.5 Celsius).
It is already having harmful consequences for others, and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change, while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs.
Overwhelmingly, the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt, to find alternative sources of food, and who do not have access to health care.
Camilla Toulmin, who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development, a London-based NGO, was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June.
So what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows?
On the downside, confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit, mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages.
Almost 30% expected to recover by the summer, and the remaining 10% foresaw normal operations after the autumn.
The disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration.
On November 4-5, the fourth Summit of the Americas took place in Mar del Plata, Argentina.
Unfortunately, the lack of progress on trade-related issues is not the only burden on relations between the US and Latin America.
Second, immigration reform in the US should be enacted in a way that protects the rights of Latino migrants.
This is not happening, because bond traders cannot imagine that the Republicans would be able – or even willing – to follow through.
Countries never default because they can’t pay their debts; there are always ways to decrease expenditures or raise taxes.
Symbolic gestures are to be expected, as with the threatened government shutdown earlier this year, which merely created fodder for political advertising by both parties.
Some people – in both countries – viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded.
Rather, it depends on a combination of capability and credibility.
First, China poses a potential threat, whereas Japan does not.
Third, the US-Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests, such as pandemics, terrorism, and human outflows from failed states.
Even so, the elections may check President Viktor Yanukovych’s power.
But the opposition, which comprises half the country, is badly demoralized after five years of stalemate among the Orange Revolution’s leaders, for which the largest share of blame falls on former President Viktor Yushchenko, who by almost all accounts has betrayed the democratic breakthrough that he represented.
Unlike Russian President Vladimir Putin, Yanukovych seems to have steamrolled too many too fast, overestimating his power and narrowing his base.
Their most vocal public representatives are First Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy and the economy minister, Petro Poroshenko, who was a major force behind the Orange Revolution.
But it is a lapsed democratic country. They must help to change that.
As a result, the possibility of achieving a common understanding of the act is being lost – and, with it, whatever potential there may be for meaningful cooperation.
While the full details of the attack on MH17 remain unknown, shooting a surface-to-air missile at a civilian airliner flying over a war zone is most likely a violation of the law of war – by which the Ukrainian government, the Russian government, and the rebels are all bound.
And, perhaps more important, doing so can play a key role in securing the political, diplomatic, and legal support needed to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Recent history explains this re-concentration of power.
The somnolent Hu/Wen era, fortunately, did not dampen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms undertaken by Jiang and Zhu.
And it announced its intention to slow local governments’ seizures of farmland and excessive borrowing through captive enterprises.
Previously, the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark; and the party’s foreign-affairs office, which handled North Korea, often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry, which handled South Korea.
This is desperation migration.
Unsurprisingly, migrant women are often victims of human trafficking, finding themselves enslaved as laborers, prostitutes, or participants in organized begging operations.
Moreover, social integration in a new country can be more difficult for women than for men.
Renminbi Rising?
Relative economic strength explains why the Japanese yen failed to develop into an IVC, and why Tokyo – whose financial markets satisfied the relevant requirements – failed to become a 1-IFC.
In fact, effective financial-monitoring and prudential-regulation systems do not have to precede opening the capital account.
While the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade, 9/11 was the turning point. Five years into this new era, how should we characterize it?
Then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support.
Jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins.
In the aftermath of 9/11, there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America’s military response against the Taliban.
The first two were forced upon the US, but the third was the result of a willful, deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush, taken on ideological grounds and, most likely, for personal reasons as well.
With Saddam gone, Iraq’s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war, leaving Iraq’s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy.
They have a point: with the Shia in power in Iraq, Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims.
This, too, is a result brought about by the American neocon masterminds.
People everywhere, consumers and investors alike, are canceling spending plans, because the world economy seems very risky right now.
Confidence isn’t built up on the basis of spending or lending alone.
After years of privation (and in many countries the physical destruction of war), people just wanted to live normally – to rebuild, own a home, a car, and other consumer goods.
She concluded that the positive effect of “pent-up demand” and government measures can “make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy.”
Seemingly peripheral issues, like aid to the developing world and the poor, who suffer the most from a crisis like this one, will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence, just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II.
But there is an important caveat, which has largely been ignored in public discussions: if this funding is senior to private debt (as IMF funding typically is), it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets.
The bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by loss-bearing capacity.
So a final element of the package ought to be a monitored pledge by eurozone banks that they will not unload bonds as the official sector steps in; that they will raise capital over time instead of continuing to deleverage (if this hurts bank equity holders, they should think of this as burden sharing); and that they will be circumspect about banker bonuses until economies start growing strongly again.
Peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops, and the arrival of jobs, productive farms and factories, tourism, health care, and schools.
Crony businesses from the US and Europe, which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions, squander time, aid funds, and opportunities.
In the fourth phase, which can last a generation or more, assistance is directed to long-term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts.
This type of aid does not require long studies, but quick action.
Only by taking quick, meaningful action to fight hunger, poverty, and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long-term peace.
You do not win people over by bombing them, but by helping them.
As a way to address this dilemma, the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan, which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process.
Only then could a new, long-term development strategy in Afghanistan – one that admits that the international community is not winning the war, and that the status quo is unacceptable – be implemented.
The topic is too broad to be discussed solely among governments and secret services.
We Europeans need to be self-critical and admit that we are not only lagging behind in terms of technical capabilities; we are also in danger of not fully grasping in time the possibilities and dangers of the digital world.
However, without domestic pressure, little will change.
This weekend in Munich, the Schmidts and Kissingers of today and tomorrow will have an opportunity to engage in what is probably the most important strategic debate of our time: how to prevent the West from falling apart in
Instead, his claim to fame was his role as architect of America’s failed war in Iraq.
Europe does not get in America’s way because it wants to maintain Europe’s equally out-dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund, the Bank’s sister institution.
Perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK’s next prime minister, he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change.
Women and Development
An obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately.
Covering every eligible girl in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $6 billion.
Other tools, aside from schooling, can help women improve their income-earning ability.
Being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life.
McCain’s selection of Palin was an attempt to appeal to these mothers and to pick up votes from women disappointed about Clinton’s loss.
At first glance, it seems reasonable that political parties might be able to translate women’s gender consciousness into a unified voting bloc.
Those who can or must support themselves outside marriage tend to favor expanding economic opportunities for women and to oppose laws and values that give familial authority to husbands and fathers.
Palin’s nomination, however, could have an unintended consequence on the gender views of social conservatives.
What does it mean to be Danish, German, or French in the presence of these millions of newcomers, most of whom come from non-democratic societies?
The program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one-to-one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Danish society.
I am often struck by the way many Europeans use arms-length euphemisms when talking about immigrants: they want immigrants to feel “welcome” or “comfortable.”
More than once, I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions.
In Tunisia, the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217-seat Constituent Assembly.
Likewise, in Egypt, women protesters face greater scrutiny than men.
They must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender-based discrimination and violence.
They all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism.
Likewise, the leader of Britain’s Conservatives, David Cameron, startled more old-fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison “need, above all, love.” When Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the “flyweight” Cameron would be carried out and the “heavyweight” Brown victorious after a short bout, he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons, but the remark went down badly with voters.
It took decades to become real, and there are still countries that have a long way to go.
Whatever the particular values of leading candidates, this is undoubtedly progress.
Looking healthy, fit, youthful, and professional are now signs that male elites use to signal their status to one another in an advanced consumer and corporate economy.
This continual, rather fetishistic sexualizing of powerful women confirms the argument I made more than two decades ago in my book The Beauty Myth: Women’s appearance is used against them most rigorously – as a diversionary tactic – when real social, economic, or political power is at stake and almost within their grasp.
But, because the media play a major role in perpetuating this double standard against women in the public eye, legislating or litigating against this kind of workplace harassment will not help.
Only the public sector, where the membership rate is 35%, has remained a union bastion. One of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike-happy Canada.
Teachers’ unions, especially, are a catastrophe, blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries’ education systems.
For rich countries, income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system, rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions.
The outlook for developing countries, in particular, is decidedly mixed.
This was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up.
Labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy: The same or higher quantity of steel, cars, and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers.
The transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions, employment protections, and norms of pay equity, greatly weakening workers’ bargaining power and job security.
Second, the forces of globalization and technological progress have combined to alter the nature of manufacturing work in a way that makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to emulate the industrialization experience of the Four Asian Tigers, or the European and North American economies before them.

Some schools are already becoming learning labs for sustainable development, where young students are being prepared to adapt to and help mitigate the consequences of climate change.
The Return of Currency Wars
In the eurozone, a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed, with Germany’s backing, by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, and the ECB have been a massive impediment to growth.
Of course, monetary easing is not purely zero-sum.
Unfortunately, the political economy of austerity has led to sub-optimal outcomes.
The world seems to be undergoing fundamental change: new actors are emerging on the world stage, previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied, and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors.
Its adherents espouse a medieval ninth-century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate, in which “the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations becomes null” and summary execution and slavery are mandatory.
As Marcel Proust noted: “Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were.”
But, rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia, we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them.
The US at the time did not seem to understand that a multipolar world order was emerging – one that would make it very difficult to pursue, without serious consequences, the policies that Bush and Clinton had discussed in 2000. In a 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin made this plain, vehemently rejecting the intervention in Iraq and especially US plans to expand antimissile defense systems to Europe, calling this an act of aggression toward Russia and a breach of common European security.
China then took matters into its own hands, spearheading the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
Macroeconomic policies, financial globalization, and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades, not only in income and wealth, but also in access to education, healthcare, social protection, as well as in political participation and influence.
Access to education for girls has improved, and some gender gaps have been reduced.
The few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions.
The economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start, and its consequences have become glaringly obvious.
In comparison, 13% of all Third World deaths result from water and air pollution.
But seriously, why do well-meaning First Worlders think that the Third World should have energy technologies that are more expensive, feebler, and less reliable than their own?
Africa needs to boost its yields, and that means enabling farmers to use modern crops, fertilizers, and pesticides.
Rather than pandering to advanced countries’ obsessions, Rio+20 could do more good for humanity – and the planet – by focusing on the top environmental problems and their simple solutions.
Critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the West today with the Germans who invaded Russia in 1941, while painting Ukrainian government officials as “fascists” and “neo-Nazis.”
Without defending Stalin, one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution – including the lives of 26 million citizens – to the Allied victory in WWII.
The parallels with Putin’s Russia are clear.
BEIJING – On November 15 Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the CCP’s Central Military Commission, giving him supreme authority over China’s armed forces.
China opened itself to the world in 1978, when Xi and his contemporaries were young men eager to understand the world outside China.
“The Pacific Ocean is wide enough to accommodate the two major countries of China and the US,” he declared.
Thus, he is willing to show diplomatic muscle if China is challenged on a core area of concern.
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – Ruling elites almost everywhere – whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes – believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power.
Official corruption escalated.
After a decade of government by slogan, the Chinese public wants substance.
In an economy where several sectors are still shackled by pervasive regulations and controls, the payment of bribes in exchange for government permits can sometimes restore some semblance of a free market.
Two distinguishing features of the Chinese economy help to explain why it has seemed able to swim successfully against the current.
But, as China has grown into a more internationally integrated, modern economy, pervasive corruption has become more harmful than beneficial.
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle, home to many of the world’s leading technology firms, most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama.
To maintain his domestic image as a strong leader, he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies.
For China, the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty (BIT).
Facing enormous domestic pressure, Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi.
But, until now, the “right” to work at home was sacrosanct at Yahoo!, something that an employee’s manager could not overrule.
Cafeteria (now more inviting and more frequented with the advent of free food), or the halls of the Plug &amp; Play startup accelerator, proximity matters.
Personally, I come at this from the opposite direction.
Sixteen graduate and undergraduate students, male and female, felt that the university’s administration then did little to push back against such encroachments on female students’ rights to a fair and non-threatening learning environment.
Indeed, in the course of trying to report to the university in 2004 what had happened to me in 1983, I found the same pattern of stonewalling victims and defending perpetrators.
I know that one undergraduate has more recently pursued legal action against a staff member, who, she said, drugged her with Rohypnol, the “date rape” drug, and assaulted her.
Yale alumnae are reportedly now contacting these 16 students with their own stories of sexual assault and harassment, spanning two decades.
For, instead of infrastructure plans, commercial or environmental treaties, or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty, the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new US-Colombian military agreement, announced less than a month before the summit.
But her words did little soothing.
Another unexpected consequence of the US-Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia.
Unemployment in the eurozone as a whole averages about 12%, compared to more than 25% in Spain and Greece (where youth unemployment now stands at 60%).
In fact, by maintaining large trade surpluses, Germany is exporting unemployment and recession to its weaker neighbors.
Two outcomes now seem possible.
Europe’s north-south divide has become a time bomb lying at the foundations of the currency union.
The average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright.
Instead of taking a direct approach – lifting the interest-rate cap imposed on banks – liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish.
They should begin by eliminating non-market-based restrictions on the real-estate sector, which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy, but also to people’s lives, with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment.
In fact, in the first half of this year, services accounted for more than half of total economic growth.
The share of working-age people (16-65 years old) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72%.
In other words, young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement.
By next year, Chinese R&amp;D expenditure, at 2.2% of GDP, will be closing in on advanced-country levels.
While the American and Yemeni governments have lauded the drones’ precise targeting, they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes, including how many have been conducted, who has been targeted, or, crucially, the number and identities of civilians killed.
Indeed, if the US never acknowledges the specific strikes, how can ordinary Americans possibly know that Rasilah al-Faqih, a pregnant Yemeni woman, was killed in Walad Rabei’, along with her husband and ten-year-old daughter, as they headed home from a visit to the doctor? Or that Abdoh Mohammed al-Jarraah’s house in Silat al-Jarraah had 19 people, including women and children, inside when it was hit by a US drone strike?
It should come as no surprise, then, that civilians like Nasser, who have lost mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters in US strikes, are outraged not only at the US, but also at the Yemeni government, which consented to the attacks.
After the attacks on New York and Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001, the group's battle took on a geopolitical dimension, as its fighters objected to Yemen's decision to collaborate with the United States and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation.
In response, armed groups seized checkpoints and closed the port of Aden.
If the turmoil is not curtailed and the Saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country's ability to function, Yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures.
But, although al-Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution, his decision was anything but altruistic.
While the Central Security Service, led by Saleh’s nephew Yahya, has received millions of dollars to fight al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza.
When more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there, al-Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war.
If the Salehs retain control of the air force, which remains under the control of Saleh’s half-brother, employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath.
Accelerating the Clean-Energy Revolution
Clean Energy Solutions Center’s no-cost “Ask an Expert” service has provided policy assistance to more than 60 countries.
At the same time, more than one billion people still have no access to electricity.
The transition to a world powered by clean energy has the potential not only to reduce carbon pollution and the risks of climate change, but also to create entrepreneurial opportunities and jobs, realize cost savings for business and individuals, enhance energy security, and improve access to energy worldwide.
The region’s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests.
It is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles, rules, and decision-making procedures for the region.
Its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century.
Asia-Pacific leaders must shake off their complacency.
In these circumstances, the US and China – the only viable candidates for global leadership – must achieve a grand compromise that reconciles their fundamental interests, in turn enabling them to act in concert to provide and protect global public goods.
The quid quo pro for these changes to US policy would be a commitment by China to respect and defend a set of international norms, principles, and institutions that was created largely without its involvement.
Nevertheless, understanding this phenomenon and its political consequences sheds light on what other OECD countries might face in the near future.
Instead, the gerontocracy has simply realized older generations’ dreams of equity and social security at the expense of today’s youth, who have been shouldered with a crushing burden of public debt.
The former can be physical (according to some studies, Italy is the only European country experiencing a “brain drain” rather than a “brain exchange”) or silent (for example, low voter turnout).
Leaders of OECD countries should look at Italy and recognize the dangers emerging from their young people who are being left behind.
In the early 2000s, short-term capital began to flow into China, with investors betting on the renminbi’s appreciation and, from 2004-2006, on rising asset prices.
Given China’s twin surpluses, the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003, so it has been selling central-bank bills ever since, with CN¥5 trillion ($812 billion) in such bills currently held by banks.
The quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments.
The fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place – including real-estate bubbles, local-government debt, rapid growth in shadow-banking activity, and rising corporate leverage ratios – remain unresolved.
This destructive cycle will be difficult to break.
Despite these risks, it is too early to bet on a corporate-debt crisis in China.
But the truth of life for a political prisoner, even for one on a hunger strike, is the opposite.
But here, in this place, it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination.

He bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause. And he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family.
सबसे महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि हमारे ख़िलाफ़ रूसी सेना के लामबंद हो जाने के बावजूद, हम चुनाव अभियान की तैयारी कर रहे हैं।  अगले महीने, यूक्रेन के नागरिक स्वतंत्र रूप से नए राष्ट्रपति का चुनाव करेंगे - जो लोकतंत्र बनाए रखने की हमारी तथाकथित विफलता पर रूसी प्रचार का सर्वोत्तम संभव मुँहतोड़ जवाब होगा।

TOKYO – Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, with official ceremonies held in Washington, DC, and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary.
There have also been political heavyweights, such as Michael Mansfield, a long-time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate, former Vice President Walter Mondale, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley, and Senator Howard Baker, who also served as President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff.
Instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him, he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected, but that will help to transform myriad aspects of Japan’s economy.
Asia’s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the United States faced when Mao Zedong marched into Beijing, and again when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah in Iran.
Yet Thaksin’s supporters did not abandon him.
So, in essence, what is happening in Thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country’s entrenched elite.
By standing aside as Thailand’s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country’s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule, Asia’s democracies risk driving some elements of the Thaksin camp into the arms of China, which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force.
If that happens, we will all know who lost Thailand. We did.
But the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama’s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe’s government who question Obama’s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America’s defense commitment.
Strangely, it is all but forgotten – particularly by the Chinese – that for two decades Japan has watched China’s rise quietly from the sidelines (even supportively, to the extent that Japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy).
Fortunately, Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different.
TOKYO – Shinzo Abe’s second term as Japan’s prime minister began with a laser-like focus on economic revitalization.
A permanent National Security Secretariat, headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience, will be established in the prime minister’s office, with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long-term national security strategy.
Although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue, it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring.
For the people of Mindanao, this is a life-changing development.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea. Indeed, the Philippines is challenging China’s claims in the International Court of Arbitration, using provisions from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
But Japan, having already endured the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 14, meaning that the war was already over when the Red Army marched in.
The lesson now being drawn is that, where territorial disputes are concerned, Japan must not kowtow to “attempts to change the status quo backed by force.”
Moreover, several bilateral economic cooperation efforts, such as projects involving liquefied natural gas, were moving forward.
A military coup, imposed following the Thai constitutional court’s ouster of an elected government on spurious legal grounds, can lead only to an artificial peace.
Putin’s idea was that he could pivot Russia’s economy into a partnership with China.
Narendra Modi’s landslide victory in India’s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller, but may well mark a decisive break with India’s traditional inward-looking policies.
Abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in Singapore at this year’s Shangri La Dialogue, the annual meeting of Asian military and civilian military leaders.
Great significance was read into who signed an official document, or who stood where atop Lenin’s Tomb in Red Square when reviewing military parades.
I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong-il’s death has been his sister, Kim Kyong-hui, and no one else.
North Korea, always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states, remains in a twilight world.
While China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime, North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself.
For Germany and South Korea, however, relationships with historic allies – NATO and the United States, respectively – appear to be changing before our eyes.
Every gesture by the South toward one of the protagonists – China, the US, Japan, and North Korea – elicits so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow devise a compensatory policy.
This is not the only recent case in which Germany has distanced itself from its allies and partners.
TOKYO – Georges Clemenceau, who, as France’s prime minister, led his country to victory in World War I, famously said that “war is too important to be left to the generals.”
Their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them, but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of Franco-German enmity, and to generations yet to come, which would benefit from reconciliation.
No doubt, many, if not most, South Korean foreign-policy experts and strategists share that sentiment.
After all, member countries would then be able to pool their resources, harmonize programs, and rationalize costs, thereby reducing individual governments’ financial burden.
The truth is that the only kind of defense the British accept is that conducted by a coalition of European states acting under their national flags, as occurred in Libya.
The French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic – exemplified by Germany’s refusal to create a fund for EU member-state operations.
The GDP-Wellbeing Gap
But GDP fails to account for changes in a country’s stock of assets, making it difficult for policymakers to balance economic, social, and environmental concerns.
By providing a long-term comparison between GDP and “inclusive wealth” for 20 countries, the report aimed to motivate policymakers to take a more comprehensive, longer-term view of their economies’ development.
The world must align its value systems with this reality.
For example, the “triangular trade” model – whereby China imports significant quantities of intermediate inputs from East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, then exports the assembled products to the US – allows for substantial redundancy in trade records. In 2010, more than one-quarter of the world’s $19 trillion in exports was counted more than once.
In 2011, Hong Kong handled about 14% of mainland China’s exports and 13% of its imports, with more than 60% of Hong Kong’s total re-exports originating from the Chinese mainland. Meanwhile, by exporting products through designated export-processing zones, companies gain access to export-tax refunds and, once the intermediate cargo is imported and processed, advantageous export tariffs.
China’s Quest for Value
At the same time, it should preserve a level playing field by explicitly prohibiting rule changes, limiting the establishment of entry and exit barriers in various industries, and using taxation, finance, and brand authentication to cultivate core competitiveness.
Although there are several ongoing trade and investment negotiations – including the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA), the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) – Chinese policies remain largely defined by the traditional World Trade Organization (WTO) framework.
With rapid growth in the local market, China could become a leading source of global demand, a hub of high-level factors of production, and a strategic center, with the Shanghai free-trade zone at its core.
And this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress – a defective constitution, censored media, and a partisan security and military establishment.
The UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections.
Zimbabwe’s Permanent Guantánamo
It is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court.
Most recently, the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence.
The actions of the Mugabe regime in the run-up to Tsvangirai’s decision demand a strong regional response to what is clearly a stolen victory.
Regional institutions can entrench themselves only if their members promote adherence to the spirit and letter of their legal frameworks.
The SADC’s censure of Mugabe and his regime should be backed up by concrete actions, such as restrictions on all arms flows to Zimbabwe, travel restrictions on senior officials of Zimbabwe’s ruling ZANU-PF party, and the threat of property seizures and the freezing of financial assets in the region and beyond.
Will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz? Although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category, he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job.
Any number of developing countries, from China to India to Brazil, could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down.
Third, Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid.
Or, less likely, he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over-reaching vision of government intervention, as others have tried.
He speaks the language of populism, raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing, schools, and health care.
Dismissing complaints, Zuma insists, “There’s no cloud around me.”
Yet, according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, at his core, “Zuma is a conservative.”
